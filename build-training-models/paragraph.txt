The Development Gap Students who are interested in studying development economics may have various motivations for doing so. They might have idealistic motivations and want to help eradicate poverty and disease in poor countries. They may intend to work for a non-governmental organization (NGO) or an international development aid agency to achieve these goals. Better knowledge of development economics can provide more useful solutions to help the poor in developing economies. Students might also have intellectual motivations and want to understand why poverty can be so persistent and how development economics can contribute to finding solutions to poverty. Why can our planet produce enough food to feed all its inhabitants, yet hundreds of millions of people still suffer from hunger? Which economic policies work best, at the regional, national, urban, and village levels, to help people escape poverty, achieve higher living standards, receive better health care and education, and live longer? How can development economics provide answers to those questions? There is no better way to introduce the topic of economic development than with some striking pictures. Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c show three different world maps produced by Mark Newman, at the Department of Physics and the Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan. The first map displays the landmass of the world’s countries. The second map represents the size of countries as proportional to their population; for example, China and India appear much larger than on standard maps since they have populations, respectively, of 1.3 and 1.2 billion people. Japan and Indonesia also appear larger. Notice how Russia and Canada appear much smaller than on standard maps. On the African continent, South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, and Ethiopia appear larger, while on the North American continent, Mexico also appears larger. In the third map, the size of a country appears as proportional to its gross domestic product. Here, the United States, Europe, and Japan appear very large, and Germany appears nearly as large as China. Notice how Central and South America and Africa have become tiny. These three maps clearly illustrate the challenges of economic development in the world. The overwhelming majority of the world’s population lives in developing countries, while most economic activity takes place in a few rich countries such as the United States, Japan, or the nations of Western Europe. Most people on the planet still have very low living standards and roughly one billion people live in conditions of great poverty, surviving on less than a dollar a day. The study of economics should not, therefore, view the issues of economic development as a marginal or exotic subject. It is the most important economic problem on our planet and development economics thus has the potential to make a significant positive impact on the lives of people around the world.

Economic Growth The Effect of Different Savings Rates Another prediction of the Solow model is that an increase in the savings rate leads to an increase in the steady state. Assume two countries, 1 and 2 , that differ only in terms of their savings rate (the two countries have the same A, n, and d ). Assume country 1 saves 5% on average of its national income and country 2 saves 15% of its national income and assume a is equal to 1/ . Using equations (11) and (22), we get the following ratio of income per capita y 1 / y 2 between the two countries: y 1 y 2 = ¢ s 1 s 2 ≤ a 1 a = a 5 15 b 1 2 = .577 Looking at the ratio y 1 / y 2 , we see that due to its lower savings rate, country 1 would end up in steady state having an income per capita that would be 57. % of country 2. Do some countries grow faster than others due to higher savings and investment rates? The Asian economies ( Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and now China) have traditionally had high savings and investment rates, and they have been growing rapidly in the last decades. Alwyn Young, among others, says that this is the main reason for the Asian growth miracle. 9 Technological progress has not necessarily been higher in those countries compared to the United States or to European economies, but their high savings rate can account for their higher growth rates. For many years, economists thought that differences in savings and investment rates were the key to development and the Solow model is consistent with this view. However, in reality, countries with high investment rates do not necessarily have higher growth rates. The best example is that of the Soviet Union, which was a centrally planned economy until 1991. Investment rates in the Soviet Union were higher than in most of the rest of the world, hovering around 30% between 1930 and 1980, while investment rates across the world generally varied between 15% and 25%. Unfortunately, central planners allocated investment inefficiently and economic growth started an increasing slowdown in the 1960s and the 1970s, reaching virtually 0% in the 1980s. China also had a relatively high savings rate before it started its market reforms in 1978, but its growth rate was low because central planners were just as inefficient as Soviet planners in allocating investment. The savings rate in the reform period (since 1978) has still been quite high, but growth rates have become spectacularly high, consistently close to 10% for over 30 years. This is because market reforms resulted in a substantial improvement in investment allocation in agriculture, light industry, and manufacturing in general. The example of China before and after its market reforms shows that the efficiency of investments can vary greatly depending on the particular economic environment. Even if savings rates do matter for growth, why do some countries have a higher savings rate than others? The Solow model does not provide insights in this regard. While it shows that higher savings rates lead to a higher steady state level of income, the savings rate is exogenously given. 9 Alwyn Young, “The Tyranny of Numbers: Confronting the Statistical Realities of the East Asian Growth Experience,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 110, no. 3 (1995): 641-680. 


Political Institutions poorer than parliamentary countries because most are in Latin America and the difference in size of government might be due to the difference in GDP per capita. However, even when Persson and Tabellini control for GDP per capita and other variables that might affect the size of government, they still find that government expenditures are larger by at least 5 percentage points in parliamentary regimes compared to presidential regimes. A similar picture emerges for social security and welfare spending; parliamentary regimes spend more than twice as much on social welfare programs than do presidential regimes. A similar finding also appears for countries with proportional elections as opposed to countries with majoritarian elections. Social welfare spending is more than 60% larger in countries with proportional elections. This is a sizable difference and is particularly intriguing because the electoral rule does not appear to have a significant effect on the size of government expenditures. Differences in terms of budget deficits between the different political regimes or the different electoral rules are, however, quite small. Various theories have been proposed to explain both the difference in the size of government spending as well as the difference in social welfare spending. The crucial difference between presidential and parliamentary regimes is that in the latter, the executive is directly chosen by a parliamentary majority and can be brought down by a vote of no confidence. In the presidential system, the executive is elected independently and cannot be brought down by a vote of no confidence. The presidential system has greater separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. (This is not true for all presidential systems; in some cases, significant power is concentrated in the executive branch while the legislative branch has few powers.) Where it does exist, separation of powers makes it possible to a divided government with a legislative majority that can even be hostile to the policies favored by the president. This situation can have two potential results: a) legislative gridlock, in which the legislature blocks policies the president proposes or the president vetoes laws the legislature enacts; or b) healthy checks and balances between the legislative and executive branches that can prevent collusion between politicians who make decisions that are not in the voters’ interests (such as diverting money for their own use or for that of their party or their cronies). In both cases, separation of powers should lead to fewer government expenditures. In the parliamentary system, there is less separation of powers between the two branches of government. The parties who control a majority in parliament also control the executive. This can lead to less legislative gridlock, but it also results in fewer checks and balances. Stronger separation of powers in the presidential system can thus explain that system’s smaller government expenditures. 4 Why do countries with proportional elections have more social welfare spending than those with majoritarian elections? In a majoritarian system, to win a majority of seats, a party needs to win a plurality of votes in a majority of districts. This means that the party will concentrate its efforts on winning the marginal districts, that is, the districts in which there is the closest competition 4 For more on this subject, see Torsten Persson, Gérard Roland, and Guido Tabellini, “Comparative Politics and Public Finance,” Journal of Political Economy 108, no. 6 (2000): 1121-1161.

The Development Gap I n this chapter, we examine some of the most important facts about economic development and consider some of the main questions studied in development economics. We first learn about the development gap , the differences in economic development between the advanced economies of the United States, Japan, and the Western European nations and the poorer economies of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. We review measures of the development gap in terms of income, life expectancy, health, education, and level of urbanization, which will provide a fresh and precise perspective on the scope of the development gap between the richest and poorest countries in the world. This gap has been evolving over time, decreasing for some countries while increasing for others. For example, in recent decades some Asian countries such as China and India have successfully undertaken a vigorous process of development and have begun to close the gap with the richest countries. Obviously there is still a long way to go, but it is encouraging to see that there are some major success stories in developing nations, and they may help us better understand why the development gap has unfortunately increased in many other poor countries. Another important fact we must consider is that development is not irreversible: rich countries can be engaged in a process of FIGURE 1c A World Map Representing a Country’s Size as Proportional to Its Gross Domestic Product In the first map, country sizes are proportional to their landmass; in the second map, they are proportional to their populations; and in the third map, they are proportional to their gross domestic product.

The Development Gap economic decline. Argentina was among the richest countries in the world at the beginning of the 20th century, but over the next 50 years, it experienced a significant downturn in its economy. Development economists have primarily focused on the success or failure of development in poor countries; they have paid less attention to the phenomenon of the decline of countries who had already achieved success in economic development. It is critical to understand economic decline in order to prevent it. Facts about the Development Gap There are different ways to measure the gap in economic development between rich and poor countries. We will look at the income gap, the health gap, the education gap, and the differences in rates of urbanization across the world. The Income Gap The first and most obvious way to measure the development gap is to measure the income gap between developed economies and poor countries. A common measure of income is gross domestic product (GDP) per capita . This is a measure of the value of output produced per inhabitant of a country during a given year. Gross domestic product per capita is a good approximation of average annual per capita income. The only difference is that annual per capita income adjusts for income flowing into or out of the country, as well as for foreign aid and remittances. Of course, these can be significant for poor countries. Nevertheless, GDP is the single most widely used measure of a country’s economic size. In order to compare across countries, we need to express GDP per capita in U.S. dollars (or some other common currency). In development economics, it is important to use exchange rates based on purchasing power parity (PPP) when converting GDP per capita in the local currency to U.S. dollars. Purchasing power parity exchange rates are based on the prices of all goods and services, and are constructed such that the same basket of goods in one country has the same dollar value in all countries. Let us look at GDP per capita across countries in 2010 using purchasing power parity. Luxemburg is the richest country in the world with a GDP per capita of $86,000. The world’s poorest country is the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly called Zaire) with a GDP per capita of only $350. This is a very large difference, close to 1:250. Other rich countries include the United States, Norway, Singapore, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita around $50,000. Most European countries have a GDP per capita between $20,000 and $40,000. In contrast, 12 countries, including Congo have a GDP per capita lower than $ ,000. These include Burundi, Liberia, Eritrea, Niger, the Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Timor-Leste, Mozambique, Madagascar, and Togo. Apart from Timor-Leste in Southeast Asia, all of these countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. Figure 2 shows a map of GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity.

The Development Gap The Health Gap There is an important health gap between rich and poor countries. People in developing countries are more prone to diseases, they do not live as long as people in developed countries, and many of their children die at a young age. Differences in life expectancy. In 2010, a child born in Japan could expect to live until 83, while a child born the same year in Sierra Leone in Africa could only expect to reach the age of 47. Life expectancy is defined as the average number of years a newborn infant would live if health and living conditions at the time of its birth remained the same throughout its life. It reflects the health conditions in a country and the quality of health care its people receive. Life expectancy is closely correlated with income, but it is instructive to look at the numbers on life expectancy in different regions of the world shown in Table 1. For each region that includes developing countries, the table identifies the countries with the lowest and the highest life expectancies. Life expectancy in North America is given for comparison. As the table indicates, life expectancy is the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa by more than 10 years compared to South Asia, and by more than 20 years compared with other regions in the world. All countries outside sub-Saharan Africa have a life expectancy above 50, except for Afghanistan, but 11 African countries have a life expectancy below 50. AIDS is a big factor in reducing life expectancy in many African countries, but it is FIGURE 3 Poverty Headcount Ratio in 2008 at Poverty Line of $2 a Day in 2005 Prices (Purchasing Power Parity) 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 East Asia & Pacific Percentage below the poverty line Eastern Europe & Central Asia Latin America & Caribbean Middle East & North Africa South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa More than two-thirds of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and in South Asia live on $2 a day.

The Development Gap Russia must now be seen as a middle-income country with a GDP per capita of $19,000, which is closer to that of Mexico ($14,500) than to that of the United States ($47,000). The Poverty Gap The income gap shows that an overwhelming proportion of the world population lives on less than $10,000 a year. However, this measure does not give an accurate idea of the extreme poverty that exists in the world. Figure 3 shows the poverty headcount ratio at $2 a day measured in purchasing power parity. This represents the percentage of the population that lives on less than $2 a day and it is a measure used by the World Bank to gauge extreme poverty. As Figure 3 demonstrates, slightly over 70% of the population in South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) fits that definition of poverty, while nearly 70% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lives below that poverty line. As a result, those two regions represent a strong concentration of extreme poverty, with 1.2 billion people in South Asia and 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa living on less than $2 a day. In East Asia and the Pacific, 33% of the population, or roughly 730 million people, live below that poverty line. Overall, a bit less than half of the human beings on the planet live on less than $2 a day. Measures of income and poverty are crucial indicators of development, but they are not the only ones. We will next look at other factors that can give us an idea of economic development and living conditions. FIGURE 2 GDP Per Capita in 2010 (Purchasing Power Parity in Dollars) GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) 2010 The World Bank H 26,152 11,748 to 26,152 4,900 to 11,748 2,061 to 4,900 h 2,061 no data The world’s poorest countries are concentrated in Africa.

The Development Gap As we can see from Figure 2, most of the world’s poorest countries are in Africa. South Africa is the richest country on the continent with slightly over $10,500 per capita. However, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa are much poorer and have a GDP per capita that is closer to the $ ,000 range. Many Asian countries are still very poor; Nepal and Afghanistan have a GDP per capita of roughly $ ,200 Bangladesh and Myanmar are below $ ,000, and Cambodia, Laos, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, the Philippines, Mongolia, and Indonesia are below $ ,000. Russia and the nations of Latin America and Eastern Europe are among the middle-income countries with a GDP per capita in the range of $ ,000 to $15,000. Brazil, for example, has a GDP per capita slightly above $11,000, which is around the Latin American average. Some of the former Soviet republics are quite poor. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have a GDP per capita close to $ ,000, roughly the level of Cambodia. Uzbekistan and Moldova have a GDP per capita slightly above $ ,000 and are poorer than Vietnam or India. During the Communist period of the 20th century, we would not have classified Soviet republics as developing countries. However, since the fall of Communism, it is clear that many former Soviet republics are actually quite poor. Even Using PPP to measure a country’s GDP (or any other statistical data) means that we must use an exchange rate based on purchasing power parity instead of the market exchange rate to obtain a dollar measure of GDP for that country. The purchasing power parity measure computes exchange rates between currencies of different countries so that the same basket of goods in any two different countries has the same dollar value . This is difficult to do but is important for making international income comparisons. One dollar will typically buy less in a rich country than in a poor country if we use existing exchange rates. For example, one U.S. dollar was exchanged internationally in 2012 at roughly 55 Indian rupees. However, 55 Indian rupees will typically buy more things in India than will one U.S. dollar in the United States. The purchasing power parity exchange rate will thus be lower than 55 rupees per dollar, probably closer to 40 rupees or even less. The world’s poorest people live on less than one dollar a day. Even though they live under conditions of extreme poverty, they can typically buy more with one dollar in their country than a resident of New York, Tokyo, or London can purchase with that same dollar. The reason why market exchange rates do not equalize purchasing power parity is that exchange rates are based only on the prices of tradable goods and do not take into account nontradables, i.e., goods and services that are not traded internationally. Non-tradable goods are usually less expensive in poorer countries. Many of these non-tradable goods are services and their price is related to the cost of labor, which is lower in poorer countries. For example, the price of a haircut is usually lower in poorer countries. The technology for cutting hair is basically the same everywhere and the cost is essentially the wage of the hairdressers. A haircut is a non-tradable service because people do not typically travel across countries to get a cheaper haircut.

The Development Gap As we can see from Figure 2, most of the world’s poorest countries are in Africa. South Africa is the richest country on the continent with slightly over $10,500 per capita. However, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa are much poorer and have a GDP per capita that is closer to the $ ,000 range. Many Asian countries are still very poor; Nepal and Afghanistan have a GDP per capita of roughly $ ,200 Bangladesh and Myanmar are below $ ,000, and Cambodia, Laos, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, the Philippines, Mongolia, and Indonesia are below $ ,000. Russia and the nations of Latin America and Eastern Europe are among the middle-income countries with a GDP per capita in the range of $ ,000 to $15,000. Brazil, for example, has a GDP per capita slightly above $11,000, which is around the Latin American average. Some of the former Soviet republics are quite poor. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have a GDP per capita close to $ ,000, roughly the level of Cambodia. Uzbekistan and Moldova have a GDP per capita slightly above $ ,000 and are poorer than Vietnam or India. During the Communist period of the 20th century, we would not have classified Soviet republics as developing countries. However, since the fall of Communism, it is clear that many former Soviet republics are actually quite poor. Even Using PPP to measure a country’s GDP (or any other statistical data) means that we must use an exchange rate based on purchasing power parity instead of the market exchange rate to obtain a dollar measure of GDP for that country. The purchasing power parity measure computes exchange rates between currencies of different countries so that the same basket of goods in any two different countries has the same dollar value . This is difficult to do but is important for making international income comparisons. One dollar will typically buy less in a rich country than in a poor country if we use existing exchange rates. For example, one U.S. dollar was exchanged internationally in 2012 at roughly 55 Indian rupees. However, 55 Indian rupees will typically buy more things in India than will one U.S. dollar in the United States. The purchasing power parity exchange rate will thus be lower than 55 rupees per dollar, probably closer to 40 rupees or even less. The world’s poorest people live on less than one dollar a day.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts a positive and concave function of L. Assume also that F ( ) = 0, that is, output equals zero if labor equals zero. Assume finally that the cost of labor is simply L itself. This is a simplification, as there are additional cost elements other than labor. Also, the disutility of labor might be a (convex) function of labor effort, but we abstract from that. The individual farmer’s choice of how much labor effort to invest will be the result of the profit maximization with H = F ( L ) L The maximum profit is attained when the derivative of H with respect to L is equal to zero, which gives us F h ( L ) = 1. In other words, the farmer will work the land up to the point where the marginal product of his labor equals 1. This optimal level of effort is L *, shown in Figure 1. In a fixed rental contract with rent R , the tenant will maximize: H R = F ( L ) L R Because R is fixed and does not vary with L, H R is also maximized when F h ( L ) = 1. Figure 1 also shows the solution: the tenant will work just as hard as the individual owner, but his income will be lower. In a typical sharecropping contract, the tenant is allowed to keep a share s (0 6 s 6 1) of output and must give the rest to the landlord. The tenant will thus maximize: sF ( L ) L This objective function is maximized when sF h ( L ) = 1 and will lead to a choice of effort L s that is lower than L*. Figure 2 shows this solution: sharecropping thus reduces the tenant’s incentive relative to ownership and a fixed rental, and the optimum can only be restored if the landlord is ready to pay a share s of the cost of effort. In that case, the tenant maximizes: sF ( L ) sL This expression is maximized if sF h ( L ) = s , which thus gives F h ( L ) = 1, the same condition as in an ownership or fixed rental contract. FIGURE 1 Incentives with Ownership and Fixed Rental Contracts L (Labor) Output, labor costs F ( L ) F ( L ) H R L F ( L ), L H R 0 L * The farmer equates the marginal benefit of his labor to its cost, yielding the optimal amount of labor L*. The optimum is the same with farm ownership or with a rental contract because in the latter case, the incentives at the margin are the same. 


The Development Gap and because countries in that region have also had less economic growth, this means that the development gap has been increasing there. To summarize, the development gap has been increasing primarily in Africa, which is already the poorest continent on earth, while the development gap has been decreasing for Asian countries, including China and India. However, a few African countries seem to have been much more successful than others in reducing the gap. Countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa or in Latin America and the Caribbean have had too low a growth rate to be able to catch up with the more advanced industrialized countries. While the development gap has been growing in many of these countries, it has been decreasing in others. How do we explain these significant differences? Our discussion leads us to formulate another very important question that development economics must confront: Why have some poor countries started to catch up in terms of development while others have failed? Stories of Economic Catch-Up and Decline The development gap emerged because some countries developed earlier than others. The British economy took off in the late 18th century, while significant growth in the American economy and most continental European economies began in the 19th century. Some countries, such as Japan and Germany, were subsequently able to catch up on the early developers while others were not. When trying to understand catch-up and decline, it is important to take a FIGURE 9 Total Population in 2010 as a Multiple of the Population in 1960 0 Population in 2010 as a multiple of population in 1960 1 0.5 1.5 2 2.5 3.5 3 4 Sub-Saharan Africa Middle East & North Africa Latin America & Caribbean Eastern Europe & Central Asia South Asia East Asia & Pacific High income: OECD Population growth in the world is highest in the poorer regions.

The Development Gap The Education Gap Access to education is another factor affecting the development gap. Countries that invest in good education can realize high productivity gains and economic growth. Unfortunately, poor countries often cannot afford a good education system, a deficit that contributes to the perpetuation of the development gap. Important progress has been made in the last decades to introduce universal access to primary school, but in poorer countries, many children still do not have access to secondary education. Figure 5 gives 2009 figures for enrollment in secondary school in the principal regions of the world. Secondary school enrollment rates are measured by dividing the number of pupils enrolled in secondary school, regardless of age, by the population in the theoretical age group for secondary education. This measure, given as a percentage, is called the gross secondary school enrollment rate. Gross enrollment rates can sometimes be above 100% when there are children enrolled who are above and/or below the theoretical age. The United Kingdom, for example, has a secondary school enrollment rate of 178% and Belgium has a rate of 160%. School enrollment rates are closely correlated with GDP per capita. As Figure 5 shows, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the world’s poorest regions, have substantially lower secondary school enrollment rates than other developing regions in the world. African countries have the lowest secondary school enrollment rates. Niger has only 12%, the Central African Republic 14%, and Burkina Faso 19%.

The Development Gap Russia must now be seen as a middle-income country with a GDP per capita of $19,000, which is closer to that of Mexico ($14,500) than to that of the United States ($47,000). The Poverty Gap The income gap shows that an overwhelming proportion of the world population lives on less than $10,000 a year. However, this measure does not give an accurate idea of the extreme poverty that exists in the world. Figure 3 shows the poverty headcount ratio at $2 a day measured in purchasing power parity. This represents the percentage of the population that lives on less than $2 a day and it is a measure used by the World Bank to gauge extreme poverty. As Figure 3 demonstrates, slightly over 70% of the population in South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) fits that definition of poverty, while nearly 70% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lives below that poverty line. As a result, those two regions represent a strong concentration of extreme poverty, with 1.2 billion people in South Asia and 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa living on less than $2 a day. In East Asia and the Pacific, 33% of the population, or roughly 730 million people, live below that poverty line. Overall, a bit less than half of the human beings on the planet live on less than $2 a day. Measures of income and poverty are crucial indicators of development, but they are not the only ones. We will next look at other factors that can give us an idea of economic development and living conditions.

The Development Gap areas. How can we bring decent housing, basic infrastructure, health, and education to the large cities of the developing world? One success story in urban development is that of Naga City in the Philippines. This is a mid-size town with 175,000 inhabitants. Until the late 1980s, like many other cities in the developing world, it was heavily indebted, corruption was rampant among city officials, and public services were in disarray due to the corruption of the Philippine government led by President Ferdinand Marcos, who ran the country as a dictatorship. After a popular uprising in 1986 that removed him from power and the election of Corazon Aquino that year as the new president of a democratic Philippines, people all over the country hoped for change. In 1988, Jesse Robredo ran for mayor of Naga City on a platform of reform. Because his opponent was linked to the old Marcos regime, people voted Robredo into office. He started by cracking down on illegal gambling, strip clubs, and prostitution. He reduced the city’s budget deficit by threaten ing businesses with higher taxes and court action if they continued to evade paying the taxes they owed. His most critical reform was to bring more transparency and citizen participation to city governance. For example, citizen representatives were encouraged to participate in local government committees, voicing their opinions and monitoring decision-making processes, an innovation that resulted in improved municipal services. When a corrupt provincial governor imposed an ineffective police chief on the city, Robredo instituted a vice squad staffed by volunteers from the city and members of the police force who were empowered to arrest criminals engaged in illegal gambling, prostitution, and other corrupt activities. In a few years, Naga City became a model of participatory governance, winning many awards worldwide. Its experience has been studied by local politicians and urban experts from all over the world. The key lesson of Naga City’s renewal is that more citizen participation in local governance was a key factor in the eradication of corruption and mismanagement. Governance is a critical issue in economic development. Why Is There a Development Gap? As we can see from the different measures of development analyzed above (GDP per capita, poverty, health, education, and urbanization), there are significant differences worldwide in terms of the level of development. The development gap is the first and most important stylized fact in the economics of development and it raises one of the most, if not the most, important questions in the economics of development: Why did some countries develop earlier than others? The Evolving Development Gap To get a clear idea of development issues, it is not enough simply to try to understand the development gap, which would give us only a static view. We also need a dynamic view. How is the development gap evolving over time? The answer is that the gap has closed dramatically for some countries while it has increased for others. There are notable examples of developing economies closing the gap with wealthier nations, but there are also nations

The Development Gap In Africa, Sierra Leone has an infant mortality rate of 134 per 1,000, Congo has 112, Somalia 108, and the Central African Republic has 106. These are the four countries with the highest infant mortality rates in the world. The 20 countries with the highest infant mortality rates are all in Africa, except for Afghanistan (103). Haiti has a mortality rate of 70.4 per thousand, Pakistan 69. , Tajikistan 52. , and Myanmar 50. . Behind all these numbers are human dramas. Every year, 9 million children die before they have reached the age of 5, leaving griefstricken families. Most of these unnecessary deaths could be avoided by reducing poverty and improving health care in these developing nations. Some developing countries have low infant mortality rates demonstrating that health care policies can make a difference. Cuba has an infant mortality rate of only 4.6 per thousand, the same rate as the United Kingdom and a lower rate than the United States ( . ). Korea ( . ), Malaysia ( . ), Montenegro ( . ), Chile ( . ), Russia ( . ), Uruguay ( . ), and Thailand (11. ) are some of the other countries with low infant mortality rates. Policy interventions can be quite effective in reducing child mortality. Between 2005 and 2010, Kenya reduced its infant mortality rate by 8% each year, perhaps the fastest reduction observed among developing countries. A key factor seems to be a policy that encourages the spread of insecticide-treated bed nets as a way to fight malaria, one of the main causes of infant mortality in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In 2003, only 8% of Kenyan households used such bed nets, but by 2008, treated bed nets were used by more than 60% of households.

Every year, 9 million children die before they have reached the age of 5, leaving griefstricken families. Most of these unnecessary deaths could be avoided by reducing poverty and improving health care in these developing nations. Some developing countries have low infant mortality rates demonstrating that health care policies can make a difference. Cuba has an infant mortality rate of only 4.6 per thousand, the same rate as the United Kingdom and a lower rate than the United States ( . ). Korea ( . ), Malaysia ( . ), Montenegro ( . ), Chile ( . ), Russia ( . ), Uruguay ( . ), and Thailand (11. ) are some of the other countries with low infant mortality rates. Policy interventions can be quite effective in reducing child mortality. Between 2005 and 2010, Kenya reduced its infant mortality rate by 8% each year, perhaps the fastest reduction observed among developing countries. A key factor seems to be a policy that encourages the spread of insecticide-treated bed nets as a way to fight malaria, one of the main causes of infant mortality in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In 2003, only 8% of Kenyan households used such bed nets, but by 2008, treated bed nets were used by more than 60% of households.

The Development Gap a percentage of levels in the United Kingdom or the United States throughout the 20th century. Around 1900, Argentina had reached 80% of the levels in the United States and the United Kingdom, but it declined continuously throughout the 20th century. By the year 2000, Argentina’s GDP per capita had shrunk to 40% that of the United Kingdom and to 30% that of the United States. China, Turkey, and Argentina are not the only examples of relative economic decline. Spain was presumably the wealthiest country in the world in the 16th century, but it did not participate in the industrialization process and became one of Europe’s poorer economies. There are other historical examples of economic decline. The Arab Caliphate, the Muslim empire created by Muhammad and his descendants under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, controlled North Africa, most of Spain to the northwest, the Arab peninsula, the Middle East, and large parts of Central Asia. It was a very rich civilization, arguably more advanced than Western Europe at the time, which was undergoing a period of cultural and economic decline during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of the Roman Empire. Throughout what was called the Islamic golden age that lasted more or less until the Crusades (11th and 12th centuries) or the Mongol invasions of Europe (13th century), there was a blossoming of science, culture, and technology. The Arabs made important breakthroughs in medicine, architecture, engineering, and science, in particular mathematics and astronomy. They preserved and expanded knowledge from the ancient Greek and Persian civilizations, which FIGURE 13 GDP Per Capita of Argentina as a Percentage of Levels in the United Kingdom and the United States 0 20 40 50 60 80 90 70 30 10 Percentage of UK Percentage of U.S. 1905 1913 1921 1929 1937 1945 1953 1961 1969 1977 1985 1993 2001 Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world in 1900, with a GDP per capita of 80% of the world’s wealthiest countries, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The Development Gap not by any means the only factor contributing to a low life expectancy. Many mothers die giving birth, diseases such as yellow fever and tuberculosis are often fatal, and parasitic diseases and malnutrition make people more vulnerable to illness, leading to an early death. Outside Africa, other countries with a low life expectancy are Haiti (61. ), Timor-Leste (62), Papua New Guinea (62. ), Cambodia (62. ), Myanmar (64. ), India (65. ), and Pakistan (65. ). Conversely, there are some rather poor countries where life expectancy is quite high. For example, life expectancy in Cuba (79) is higher than in Chile (78. ) and, for that matter, higher than any other country in Central or Latin America. As a comparison, life expectancy in the United States (78. ) is lower than in Cuba or Chile. In China, life expectancy is 73.3 years. Countries from the former Soviet Union have a relatively low life expectancy; Russia’s is 68. , which is lower than Indonesia (68. ). Turkmenistan has a life expectancy of only 64. , which is below India or Pakistan. Kazakhstan has a life expectancy of 68. , which is lower than Nepal (68. ) or the Philippines (68. ). Differences in infant mortality rates. The infant mortality rate measures the probability that a child will die before reaching age 1. It is computed as the number of children dying before age 1 per 1,000 live births in the same year. One has to divide this rate by 10 to compute the probability of dying before age 1. As Figure 4 shows, infant mortality rates are the highest in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the regions in the world where there are also the highest poverty rates. For the sake of comparison, the figure shows infant mortality rates for high income countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

The Development Gap experiencing stagnation and decline. We first look at data on economic growth and population dynamics. Differences in Economic Growth It is helpful to look at the growth rates of different groups of countries. Figure 7 shows average growth rates of GDP per capita (measured in purchasing power parity or PPP) across different developing regions of the world between 1980 and 2010. As Figure 7 reveals, the East Asia and Pacific region has had very strong growth in GDP per capita rates in the last 30 years, at over 4% per year. Growth in South Asia has also been very strong. In contrast, growth in sub-Saharan Africa has been close to zero and in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) and in Latin America and the Caribbean, it has been lower than 1%. On average, China has been growing at over 8% a year, the highest growth rate over that period for any single economy in the world. This means multiplying income per capita by more than a factor of 10 over that period! Other Asian countries such as South Korea, India, Thailand, and Singapore have been growing at a very healthy pace as well—all with an average growth rate above 4% per year. As a consequence, the gap between Asian economies and the advanced industrialized economies has definitely been declining in the last 3 FIGURE 7 Average Annual Growth Rate (1980-2010) of GDP Per Capita (PPP) in Constant 2005 Prices 0 1.5 1 0.5 2 2.5 3 4 3.5 4.5 Average annual growth rate: 1980 H 2010 (%) Sub-Saharan Africa Middle East & North Africa Latin America & Caribbean Eastern Europe & Central Asia South Asia East Asia & Pacific Growth rates of GDP per capita in the last 3 decades have been high in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia, and low in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

The Development Gap was ultimately passed on to the Europeans during the Renaissance. Commerce was vibrant throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle East during the Islamic golden age. Baghdad was for centuries one of the richest and most culturally sophisticated cities in the world. There were other civilizations that realized regional or global economic supremacy. Ancient Egypt was probably the wealthiest country in the world from 3200 BCE to 332 BCE, the longest known period of economic supremacy in history. At its height in 500 BCE, the Persian Empire controlled the Middle East and parts of North Africa and Central Asia until Alexander the Great defeated its army in 330 BCE. The Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire were both technologically and economically very advanced. It was not until the 15th century that Western Europe achieved the living standards that existed under the Roman Empire a thousand years before. When the Roman Empire split in two in 395 CE and Rome was invaded by barbarian hordes, the Eastern Roman empire, Byzantium, continued to develop rigorously, and was a dominant regional power, only rivaled by the Arabs between the 6th and 11th centuries. Certainly there are other examples of civilizations that rose and fell before the Industrial Revolution, which permanently changed economies from predominantly rural to predominantly urban and industrial. Apart from Argentina, we probably have not yet witnessed long-term declines in industrialized countries because the history of industrialization is still young and spans only about 250 years. However, it is interesting to note that the United Kingdom, the first country to industrialize, went through a period of relative decline in the 20th century. While it was clearly the richest country in the world in the 19th century, its economic supremacy was lost in the 20th century and it is only toward the end of the 20th century that the British economy began to bounce back. Even within industrialized countries there are whole regions that go through periods of long-term economic decline. This discussion leads us to the following question: Why do some wealthy countries begin to decline and ultimately become poor? This is obviously a question that concerns both developing countries as well as prosperous economies. The fear is often raised that competition from dynamic developing countries such as China and India might eventually undermine the economies of the richer countries (the Western European nations, the United States, and Japan), resulting in their economic decline. Important Questions In this chapter, as we examined the facts that contribute to the development gap, we have asked three important questions: 1. Why did some countries develop earlier than others? 2. Why have some poor countries started to catch up economically while others have failed to develop? 3. Why do some rich countries decline and ultimately become poor? In this chapter, we have mainly reviewed the factors that contribute to the development gap; as a result, we have not yet tried to provide answers to these questions. Obviously, these are not the only questions studied in development

The Development Gap Definitions Development gap The differences in economic development between the advanced economies of the world and the poorer developing economies. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita A measure of output per inhabitant in a country. It is a good approximation of average annual per capita income. Industrial frontier A situation in which the most advanced technologies in the world are used in various industrial sectors. Infant mortality rate The number of children dying before age 1 per 1,000 live births in the same year. Divide this rate by 10 to compute the probability a child will die before age 1. Life expectancy The average number of years a newborn infant would live if health and living conditions at the time of his or her birth remained the same throughout its life. Life expectancy reflects the health conditions in a country and the quality of health care its people receive.

The Development Gap of the 19th century. The robust American economy became the world’s largest only toward the end of the 19th century. As we can see, in the first decades after the Meiji restoration, Japanese income per capita was less than 30% that of the United Kingdom or the United States. By the beginning of the 1930s, it was over 40%. After a large dip following World War II, a very impressive catchup process began and by the end of the 1970s, Japan had overtaken the British economy, which had a less-impressive growth rate in the decades following World War II. In the first 2 decades after the war, Japanese income per capita also rose strongly relative to the United States and reached a peak of over 80% around 1990. However, the 1990s were a decade of stagnation for the Japanese economy. Another example of successful catch-up is that of the German economy. Germany has existed as a country only since 1871. Before that, there were many independent German states. In the 19th century, Germany lagged behind the United Kingdom in its industrialization process. It is only after the unification of Germany that Bismarck, the German chancellor, launched a large-scale industrialization program that focused on the development of heavy industry. German unification itself contributed greatly to the development of markets, as tariffs between German states were abolished. The industrialization process also included the rapid development of railways and the importation of various technologies from the United Kingdom such as steel production. A new type of bank emerged, the universal bank , i.e., a financial institution that both FIGURE 10 Japan’s Per Capita Income as a Percentage of Levels in the United Kingdom and the United States 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Percentage of UK Percentage of U.S. 1889 1881 1897 1905 1913 1921 1929 1937 1945 1953 1961 1969 1977 1985 1993 2001 Until World War II, income per capita in Japan was below 40% of the levels in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Poverty and Inequality own more than 50% of its wealth. 1 What about inequality on a country-bycountry basis? While some poor countries have a relatively egalitarian distribution of wealth and income, other countries are much more inequitable than the United States (which, among the advanced economies of the world, is one of the most inequitable). 2 How do we measure inequality? What determines the gap between the rich and the poor, and why does it vary across countries? Does inequality tend to increase or decrease over time? Is inequality good or bad for growth? We will see that while inequality has increased in many countries, the spectacular growth in China, India, and other Asian countries has led to a decline of overall income inequality worldwide. Poverty Measurement and Comparisons In order to fight poverty, international organizations, governments, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have worked to establish policies that support and aid those in need on the planet. 3 To identify those who are in need, we need to be able to measure poverty in a meaningful way and compare poverty levels among various countries. Measuring Poverty While it may seem easy to recognize poverty, it is difficult to define and measure it properly so as to make meaningful international comparisons. In this section, we examine the main methods used to measure poverty. 4 Poverty measurements are usually based on survey data. A survey is a sampling of data based on questionnaires asked of a limited but representative subset of the population to be assessed. Local poverty assessments. Researchers trying to survey poverty in developing countries sometimes ask the people in villages who among them is poor. These questions usually receive the typical answers: the poorest in a village are often the disabled, the ill, the elderly, the widows, and the weaker members of the community who do not get enough support from their families. However, when villagers find out that the surveys will be used to target poverty relief, 1 James B. Davies, Susanna Sandström, Anthony Shorrocks, and Edward N. Wolff, “The World Distribution of Household Wealth,” 2008 UNU-WIDER Discussion Paper No. 2008/ . 2 In 2001 in the United States, 10% of the population controlled 69. % of the wealth. Davies et al., “The World Distribution of Household Wealth,” 2008. 3 Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are voluntary private associations pursuing nonprofit motives such as promoting health, education, or peace. They are mainly funded through gifts and grants. They may receive money from a government, but are not under any form of government control. 4 A very complete and informative survey on the definition and measurement of poverty can be found in Angus Deaton, “Measuring Poverty in a Growing World (or Measuring Growth in a Poor World),” Review of Economics and Statistics 87, no. 1 (February 2005): 1-19.

They are mainly funded through gifts and grants. They may receive money from a government, but are not under any form of government control. 4 A very complete and informative survey on the definition and measurement of poverty can be found in Angus Deaton, “Measuring Poverty in a Growing World (or Measuring Growth in a Poor World),” Review of Economics and Statistics 87, no. 1 (February 2005): 1-19. 


Poverty and Inequality on a large enough scale. In addition, the cost of living is lower in rural areas than in urban areas. Other international challenges of surveys. Even if we were able to find a good exchange rate with which to compare the living standards of the poor, international comparisons are still an issue because surveys to determine the poverty line are done differently in different countries. In some countries, people are asked about their incomes, while in others, they are asked to report their expenditures. However, expenditure reports can differ from income reports in as many ways as people save, borrow, receive money, and sometimes hide income. Moreover, it may be more difficult for people to remember accurately their expenditures rather than their income. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way to convert income into expenditures without doing additional surveys. Other problems arise from the type of information on which the surveys focus. For example, estimate what you spent in the last week. Now think of what you spent in the last month. Are your weekly expenditures exactly onefourth of your monthly costs? Probably not. Asking about expenditures over a longer period provides a clear idea of people’s average purchases. If asked to report only over a 7-day period, people might have bought more or less during that period than what they would on average. Over a period of 1 month, the error is likely to be smaller. However, over a 1-month period, people are very likely to forget many of their expenditures.These differences can be quite substantial. In India, surveys typically cover expenditures over a monthly period. However, in an experiment to see how monthly and weekly numbers varied, some people were randomly chosen to report over a monthly period, while others were randomly chosen to report over a 7-day period. On average, households reported roughly 30% more food purchased over the 7-day reporting period and 18% more on other expenditures. Such a measurement error could cut the poverty headcount in India by half! 5 All of these issues should make us aware that the data gathered on poverty are necessarily very imperfect. One dollar a day. The 1-dollar-a-day methodology that the World Bank has pioneered and used defines an international poverty line. In an early study, Martin Ravallion from the World Bank and two co-authors noticed that national poverty lines in developing countries tended to be clustered around 1 dollar a day. 6 The World Bank, in its annual World Development Report for 1990, used the 1-dollar-a-day-standard as the international poverty line. The 1-dollar-a-day definition of extreme poverty was subsequently adopted at the 2000 Millennium Summit, where world leaders met at the United Nations 5 Angus Deaton, “Measuring Poverty,” 2005 and Abhijit Banerjee, Roland Benabou, and Dilip Mookherjee, eds., Understanding Poverty (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006): 3-16. 6 Martin Ravallion, Gaurav Datt, and Dominique van de Walle, “Quantifying Absolute Poverty in the Developing World,” Review of Income and Wealth, 37 no. 4 (December 1991): 345-361.

The Development Gap urbanization rate of 30. % and China’s rate is 44. %. Many Asian countries have become highly urbanized; for example, South Korea has an urbanization rate of 81%, higher than Japan’s (67%). In Latin America, Guyana is the least urbanized country, but it still has an urbanization rate of 28. %. Many Latin American countries have very high urbanization rates, with Venezuela at 93%, Uruguay 92. %, Argentina 92. %, Chile 89%, Brazil 86. %, and Mexico 77. %. These rates clearly demonstrate that the planet is becoming more and more urbanized. Since 2010, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. Worldwide, a majority of countries now have urbanization rates over 50%, with all rates increasing rapidly. In contrast to historic trends, current higher levels of urbanization are not necessarily equivalent to higher levels of income as many migrants now move from the countryside to live in urban slums under conditions of extreme poverty with no basic infrastructure such as water, gas, electricity, transportation, and sewage systems. Today, developing countries have some of the largest cities in the world. Mexico City has nearly 23 million inhabitants; Sao Paulo (Brazil) and Mumbai and New Delhi (India) have around 20 million inhabitants; Shanghai (China) has 18 million; Jakarta (Indonesia) has over 16.5 million; Kolkata (India) and Cairo (Egypt) have close to 16 million; and these numbers keep going up. Out of the 20 largest cities in the world, only three are in advanced industrialized countries (Tokyo, New York, and Los Angeles). These high urbanization rates in the developing world mean that when we consider policies to alleviate poverty, we should think of both rural and urban FIGURE 6 World Urbanization Rates, 2010 Legend Less than 34 34-50 50-66 66-78 78 or more No data Time: 2010 Series: Urban population (% of total population) While urbanization rates are lower in Africa and in South Asia, large portions of the world have rates above 50%.

The Development Gap African countries have secondary enrollment rates below 30%. Pakistan has the lowest enrollment rate outside Africa with 33. %. In comparison, Bangladesh has 49% and India has 60%. Other countries in Asia having low enrollment rates are Cambodia (45%), Myanmar (53%), Timor-Leste (58%), and Bhutan (60. %). In contrast, China has an enrollment rate of 80%. In Latin America, El Salvador (63%) has the lowest enrollment rate followed by Paraguay (67%). Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and several Caribbean island nations have rates above 90%. In sub-Saharan Africa, the countries with the best enrollment rates are South Africa (93%), Cape Verde (85%), and Botswana (80%). Clearly there is considerable variation in school enrollment across continents and even across countries. A big success story in education is South Korea, a nation that used to be very poor. In the 1960s, its income level was comparable to Afghanistan, but it currently has a GDP per capita comparable to Israel or New Zealand. In a few years, it could even catch up with Japan. The South Korean education system is an even bigger success story, excelling beyond those in some of the most advanced economies and it is certainly an important factor behind South Korea’s economic success. South Korea now tops all other countries in the world in terms of the proportion of young people who have completed secondary school. Currently, 97% of South Koreans between the ages of 25 and 34 have achieved secondary education. This is better than Norway and Japan, where slightly more than 90% have achieved that goal. South Korea is among the top countries in the world in terms of the proportion of young people entering university. In an international comparison of math skills, Korean teenagers placed second behind Finland. South Korea has not only consistently invested in education, but it has also managed its education system quite efficiently. The Urbanization Gap Rich countries are typically very urbanized. The Industrial Revolution developed in cities as workers came from the countryside to the city to earn a better living in factories rather than continue to toil on the land. Even today, the large service sector in rich countries is primarily located in cities. Typically, we tend to think of poorer countries as having a low level of urbanization and a larger share of the population that still lives in rural areas and works on the land. As we will see below, this situation is changing. Figure 6 provides an overview of urbanization rates worldwide. These rates measure the proportion of a country’s population living in urban areas as opposed to rural areas. Many small countries are strongly urbanized, but even large countries like the United States and Canada, with great expanses of land, have high urbanization rates, even into the 80% range. Africa is the continent with the lowest level of urbanization. Burundi, Uganda, Niger, Ethiopia, and Rwanda have urbanization rates below 20%. However, some African countries are highly urbanized; for example, Djibouti and Gabon have urbanization rates close to 90%. Libya has an urbanization rate of 78%, while Liberia, Cape Verde, Botswana, South Africa, the Republic of Congo, Angola, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, and Nigeria have urbanization rates above 50%. In Asia, the least urbanized countries are Nepal (18. %), Cambodia (22. %), Afghanistan (24. %), Bangladesh (28. %), and Vietnam (28. %). India has an

Poverty and Inequality price index is typically not the same as the basket of goods used to calculate the poverty line. If the prices of basic foodstuffs used in the poverty line calculation increase by 8% and the consumer price index increases only by 5%, then a 5% adjustment to the calculation of the poverty line will be too low by 3%. In some countries, the price adjustment of the poverty line is done more accurately by taking into account only the prices of the basket of foods bought by the average poor. However, even in that case, the basket itself is rarely updated to take into account changes in the consumption habits of the poor. Another challenge in measuring poverty using the poverty line is that with urbanization and the decline of agriculture, people tend to need less calories. Using the same calorie standard in cities as in rural areas tends to overestimate the poverty line in cities relative to the countryside. In principle, research should adjust for a lower calorie count in cities, but there is no exact way to do this. A related issue is that people in cities tend to be better organized politically and are closer to the sites of power than those in the countryside. The For people living at or near the poverty line, an increase of 10% in the price of food means roughly a decrease of 10% in the amount of food they can afford. Large price swings can easily plunge hundreds of millions of people into acute hunger or even starvation. In 2008, the price of many basic food items in developing countries increased substantially, leading to episodes of hunger and food protests. The international price of wheat roughly doubled within a year and the price of rice doubled or tripled in many places, leading various Asian governments such as Indonesia and India to suspend their exports of rice. In June of that year, the price of wheat in Pakistan went up by more than 25%. The increased cost of rice and cereals in the world contributed to pushing 120 million people into hunger in 2008. The price of meat and dairy products also went up dramatically, making meat, in particular, unaffordable for most poor people. In Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world, the 2008 crisis was particularly devastating. The price of rice, beans, fruit, and condensed milk went up by 50% during the first half of 2008. The most vulnerable were Haiti’s children, dozens of whom died of malnourishment at the height of the food crisis. In order to quell their hunger, people were eating “dirt cookies,” made from a combination of clay, soil, and salt, that had no nutritional value and contained toxins and parasites that caused illness. The crisis became worse after storms flooded fields in late summer and destroyed a large part of the harvest. Emergency food aid from the international community avoided widespread starvation. In 2010, a 7.0 earthquake hit Haiti and killed at least 100,000 people, causing even more devastation to the already impoverished country and its minimal infrastructure. The nation’s extreme poverty was one of the reasons for the high number of casualties resulting from the earthquake: in its aftermath, undernourished people were living in unsafe dwellings with little or no sanitation or medical facilities. Emergency aid from the international community was again organized to alleviate the consequences of this natural disaster. Three years later, in 2013 more than 300,000 Haitians were still living in temporary shelters. The Effect of the 2008 Food Price Hikes on the World’s Poor

The Development Gap could very quickly reach the industrial frontier , i.e., a situation in which the most advanced technologies are used in various industrial sectors. The necessity to achieve these economies of scale and the incentive to catch up required sufficiently large amounts of capital, which were provided either by the private sector or by the government. In Germany, universal banks helped finance large-scale investments, while in Japan, this role was played by the zaibatsu . State intervention also played an important role by providing the necessary infrastructure investment, opening domestic markets to competition, or shielding infant industries from foreign competition. In both Germany and Japan, the state often directly provided part of the capital necessary for accelerated industrialization. However, while there can be significant advantages to economic backwardness, not all countries are able to use these advantages to their benefit. The data provided earlier in this chapter on the increasing development gap shows that most countries are not able to do so. The examples of economic catch-up show that the development gap is not necessarily inevitable. It is not true that once a country lags behind, it cannot catch up. While this gives us reasons to be optimistic, the evidence on catch-up does not in itself give us an explanation of how and why it may or may not occur. Economic Decline When we look at the big questions of development, it is possible to overlook the fact that certain developing countries were not always poor. Historically, some countries were among the richest in the world, but they descended into poverty or stagnated. The best known example is China. China was the richest country in the world for at least several centuries. Many modern inventions, such as gunpowder, the crossbow, the abacus, the wheelbarrow, and the compass originated in China. The Chinese invented iron casting and were the first to harness draft animals, which greatly improved agricultural productivity. They invented paper, ink, and printing. The first seismoscopes to register earthquake tremors were built in China. Figure 12 gives estimates by Maddison on GDP per capita in China and Europe at different times in history. Gross domestic product per capita is measured in 1990 international dollars, i.e. using purchasing power parity exchange rates based on 1990 U.S. dollars. Obviously, these numbers are very approximate and represent very imperfect measures of GDP per capita. However, it seems clear that China had higher average living standards than Europe until at least the 14th century or even the beginning of the 17th century. China had higher average living standards than Japan until about the early 19th century. The country then experienced a long period of economic stagnation under the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and the Qing dynasty (1644-1912). The British colonized China in the 19th century and the country experienced several civil wars in the 19th and early 20th centuries, first between warlords and later between the Nationalists and the Communists who fought for power after the last Qing emperor was deposed. The Chinese economy experienced turbulent years under Mao Zedong (1949-1976) and it was only in 1978 that it started growing economically again once the transition process from socialism to capitalism was initiated.

The Development Gap economics. However, the three questions raised here, especially the first two, are at the crux of most other questions that development economists try to answer. Chapter Summary Facts about the Development Gap We have presented data on the development gap that shows the differences in income, health, education, and level of urbanization across countries in the world. These data give us a better sense of what we are dealing with when we consider development issues, and they help to inform us about the economies of different countries. The development gap is greatest in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. We presented some success stories in health (the Kenyan experience with treated bed nets and the fight against malaria), education (the South Korean education system), and urban development (the experience of Naga City in the Philippines). The Evolving Development Gap We examined data on economic growth in the different countries and regions of the world and discussed the fact that some developing countries, mostly in Asia, have been growing rapidly and have begun to close the development gap. Other countries, in particular in Africa, have unfortunately seen the development gap increase in recent decades. Stories of Economic Catch-Up and Decline We presented some historical data on the process of economic catch-up that took place in Japan and Germany since the end of the 19th century. We have also seen examples of the opposite tendency, that of decline, in particular the case of Argentina, clearly not the only case of economic decline in history.

Poverty and Inequality ratio. We can use the data in this example to compute the average poverty gap in each country. In country A, H = 50%, z = 1, and y q = [(20 * 0.25) + (80 * 0.75)]/100 = 0.65. We thus find that APG = 50%(1 0.65)/1 = 17. %. Another way of looking at this is as follows: 10 million people have a daily income between 0 and 25 cents, and 10 million people have a daily income between 25 and 50 cents. In other words, 20 million people, or 10% of the population, have an average distance of 75 cents from the poverty line. Similarly, we can see that 80 million people, or 40% of the population, have an average distance of 25 cents from the poverty line. The average poverty gap is: (10 * 0.75) + (40 * 0.25) = 17. %. Turning to country B, we see that H = 50%, z = 1, and y q = [(80 * 0.25) + (20 * 0.75)]/100 = 0.35 As a result, APG = 50%(1 0.35)/1 = 32. %. From a different perspective, 40% of the population has an average daily income of 25 cents and 10% of the population has an average daily income of 75 cents. The average poverty gap is thus (40 * 0.75) + (10 * 0.25) = 32. %, which is higher than in country A. An easy interpretation of the average poverty gap is the percentage of the population to which one would have to give a dollar a day in order to make sure nobody lives below the poverty line (of 1 dollar a day). This is, of course, a fictitious transfer, but it reflects the fact that people below the poverty line are counted with weights according to the distance between their income and the poverty line. Note that the average poverty gap is by definition smaller than the poverty headcount ratio. These measures would be equal only if those living below the poverty line had an income of zero. Table 2 gives both the poverty headcount ratio and the average poverty gap for selected countries. Take Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, referred to henceforth as Congo. Both have a poverty headcount Income distribution below poverty line (daily income) Between 0 and 25 cents Between 25 and 50 cents Between 50 and 75 cents Between 75 cents and 1 dollar Poverty headcount ratio (in %) Average poverty gap (in %) Country A (millions of people) 10 10 40 40 50 17.5 Country B (millions of people) 40 40 10 10 50 32.5 Country A and country B both have 50% of the population below the poverty line. However, there is more extreme poverty in country B than in country A. The average poverty gap takes this difference into account.

Poverty and Inequality urban poor would resist any attempt to lower the poverty line because of the negative effect such a measure might have on government decisions to redistribute income toward those living at or below the current line. As a result, it is difficult to keep politics out of the determination of the poverty line. The poverty gap. Another problem with determining a definition for the poverty line is that someone with an income 1 cent above the poverty line would not be declared poor, while someone with an income 1 cent below the poverty line would be. Common sense suggests that these people have roughly the same income, but how can one be declared poor and not the other? If a government were judged by how much it reduces poverty, it could theoretically give very small transfers of aid to those who are slightly below the poverty line to get them barely above the line. Theoretically, it could even take assistance away from the very poor to finance small transfers to those who are slightly below the poverty line. This process, targeting the “richest”of the poor, would only improve the country’s poverty score on paper without doing much to alleviate actual poverty. A solution to this problem is to measure the poverty gap (also called the total poverty gap) that, unlike the poverty headcount, takes into account the degree of poverty, or the distance to the poverty line. The poverty gap assesses people below the poverty line according to their distance from the line. For example, an individual with an income equal to 90% of the poverty line would be counted with a weight of 10% (10% below the poverty line), while someone with an income equal to 10% of the poverty line would be counted with a weight of 90% (90% below the poverty line). In practice, it is difficult to obtain exact data on the income of all those below the poverty line, but researchers can compute the poverty gap by multiplying the poverty headcount Q by the average distance of the poor from the poverty line, in proportion to the poverty line. Calling y q the average income of the poor who are below the poverty line and z the poverty line, the poverty gap PG is thus calculated as follows: PG = Q ( z y q )/ z A related calculation is the average poverty gap APG, obtained by dividing PG by N the population: APG = ( Q / N )( z y q )/ z = H ( z y q )/ z This calculation can be compared with the poverty headcount ratio because it gives a measure of poverty relative to the general population. Table 1 illustrates how we calculate the average poverty gap. We take a very simple numerical example and assume a poverty line of 1 dollar a day. Take two countries, A and B, that have total populations of 200 million each with 100 million below the poverty line, i.e., with a poverty headcount ratio of 50%. A close look at Table 1 shows, however, that in country B, 80 million people have a daily income of less than 50 cents while in country A, only 20 million people have a daily income below 50 cents. In other words, country B has a larger concentration of people with an income below 50 cents compared to country A, even though both countries have the same poverty headcount

The Development Gap historical perspective and look not only at what happened in the past decades, but also at economic evolution over the last centuries. In this section, we analyze some historical success stories of economic catch-up: Japan and Germany. We also analyze historical stories of decline: China, Argentina, and Turkey’s Ottoman Empire. These countries have been growing strongly in recent years, but have experienced significant economic decline in the past. The Historical Catch-Up of Japan and Germany China and India, the two most populated countries in the world, have shown strong signs of economic catch-up in recent years, but they have not yet equaled the world’s most advanced economies. This was not the case for Japan and Germany; during the late-19th century, these nations were very successful in their efforts to catch up with the most economically developed countries of that time. Japan has one of the most successful stories of catch-up in economic history. It was, traditionally, a feudal society and remained closed to the outside world during the Tokugawa period (1603-1867). During that time, the country was ruled by a dynasty of shoguns , or hereditary military dictators. In 1867, the Meiji emperor took back the power from the Tokugawa shogun and engaged in a very radical and comprehensive program of social and political reforms. Japan’s rigid feudal system, with its division of society into four caste groups ( samurai , which was the aristocratic warrior class, farmers, artisans, and merchants) was abolished, and the traditional power of the samurai was dismantled. The emperor sent missions to Europe and the United States to study the institutions of industrialized countries. Students were sent abroad for education and thousands of Western teachers were hired to instruct Japanese students. The Japanese government made large infrastructure investments; it built extensive railroad and road systems, and electrification spread rapidly throughout the country. The government vigorously promoted industrialization by financing investments in large factories, setting corporate taxes at a low level, and instituting initiatives to help businessmen create networks of business relationships and associations. Large conglomerates, i.e. business groups known as the zaibatsu and composed of various firms that spanned different sectors of the economy (Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Nissan are names still familiar today), began to emerge. These conglomerates contributed to vigorous economic growth until World War II. The zaibatsu enjoyed large economies of scale and provided a useful structure to firms within the conglomerates for financing investments. After its defeat in World War II and the destruction of a large part of its infrastructure, Japan recovered quickly and underwent several decades of very spectacular growth based on high-quality and low-cost manufacturing. Massive quantities of Japanese cars, motorcycles, and electronics were exported to markets around the world. Figure 10 shows the catch-up process of the Japanese economy. It displays economic historian Angus Maddison’s estimate of Japan’s per capita income over time as a percentage of that of the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom was the first country to industrialize and was the most advanced economy in the world during most

Economic Growth average GDP per capita growth rate between 1960 and 2008 for the 189 countries included in the Penn World tables. 12 Notice that countries that were poorer in 1960 have not necessarily had a higher growth rate than richer countries. Some did, but others did not. There is no negative correlation between initial GDP per worker and growth, contrary to what the Solow model predicts. Some countries have been catching up, but other countries have not seen much growth for decades. As we can see in Figure 4, some countries like Zimbabwe (ZWE), the Central African Republic (CAF), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (ZAR), Haiti (HTI), Nicaragua (NIC), or Venezuela (VEN) have even had, on average, negative growth. Could we explain the absence of obvious convergence by differences in technological change across countries? The Solow model cannot explain such differences because technological progress is exogenous. Higher rates of technological progress in rich countries may offset a lower marginal product of capital, but we would still have to explain why some countries have experienced more technological progress than others. In other words, we would have to have an endogenous explanation for technical change rather than a less satisfactory exogenous explanation. Endogenous Growth Theory Endogenous growth theory proposes a drastic alternative to the Solow growth model in both its components and its predictions. Contrary to the Solow model where technology is exogenous, endogenous growth theory suggests that growth is generated by endogenous technical change resulting from entrepreneurial innovation. This theory generated great excitement in the economics profession when it was introduced in a now-famous model by Paul Romer. 13 This model and a closely related, well-known paper by Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt have initiated a whole body of economics literature. 14 Boundless Knowledge-Based Growth Endogenous growth theory is optimistic about the possibilities of economic growth and development. One of its important predictions is that growth can be boundless. Just as people in the 16th century could not imagine how we would live in the 21st century, endogenous growth theory envisions a world in which future generations may benefit from advances in technology that we cannot even grasp today. Endogenous growth theory does not deny that resources are finite or that the planet is facing serious ecological problems, but states that economic incentives have the potential to bring about technological change that significantly reduces our use of finite resources and helps us transition to the use of renewable resources. 12 The Penn World Tables give purchasing power parity estimates of GDP and GDP per capita. 13 Paul M.

The Development Gap Throughout history, China was not the only country to experience periods of superior economic development as compared to Europe. After the fall of Constantinople (1453), most of Eastern Europe was dominated by the Ottoman Empire, which was for several centuries, militarily superior to most of the contemporaneous European nations. The Ottoman empire controlled not only modern-day Turkey, the Middle East and large parts of Northern Africa, but also most of the Balkans and what constitutes modern Greece, the whole of the former Yugoslavia (apart from Croatia), Romania, Bulgaria, and parts of Hungary, the Crimea and most of the area around the Black Sea. Estimates of living standards are hard to calculate but economic historians Suleyman Ozmucur and Sevket Pamuk have computed statistical time series for the wages of unskilled construction workers in Istanbul, London, Paris, and Vienna from the 15th to the 19th centuries. 2 Wages in Istanbul were always about a third lower than in Western Europe, but in the 19th century they started to decline as these European nations began to industrialize. The Ottoman Empire subsequently declined throughout the 19th century and eventually collapsed during World War I. Argentina was one of the 10 richest countries in the world in the early 20th century. However, at the end of the century, Argentina had declined relative to all other wealthy countries.

The Development Gap In sub-Saharan Africa, some countries have had very respectable growth rates. This is the case for Botswana and Mauritius, which have had average growth rates of over 4% per year during that period. However, growth rates for most other countries are either around the 1% level, on average, or are even experiencing a negative rate. Many of the poorest countries in the world have not only become poorer relative to the richer countries, but they have also become poorer than they initially were in 1980. This includes some large African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. Countries in the Middle East and North Africa have had rather low growth rates. Saudi Arabia has had a negative growth rate despite the surge in oil revenues resulting from the 1973 oil embargo placed on Western nations by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), from which Saudi benefited tremendously. Algeria and Mauritania have had growth rates close to zero. Egypt and Morocco have had the fastest growth, but only at an average of 2. % and 2% per year respectively. Latin America has had a lackluster growth performance in the last 30 years with Chile ( .15%) and the Dominican Republic ( . %) being the only exceptions. Most countries in the region have had an average growth rate between 1% and - %. The 1980s have often been referred to as a lost decade for Latin America because the region struggled with large foreign debts in a decade of high real interest rates and many countries underwent structural adjustment programs supervised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Population Growth When considering the evolution of the development gap, population growth is also a relevant variable. Population growth should contribute to GDP growth because a larger population increases the labor force. However, if output growth is slower than population growth, GDP per capita will tend to fall. In addition, if population growth is larger in the poorer countries, the proportion of the poor in the world population will increase more over time. In other words, there will be more and more people on the wrong side of the development gap. Figure 9 shows the population in various regions of the world in 2010 as a multiple of the population in 1960. The world’s poorest region, sub-Saharan Africa with a current population of 854 million, has had the highest population growth. In 2010, its population was 3.7 times larger than 50 years ago. The Middle East and North Africa, with a population of 383 million, had the next highest population growth, increasing by more than 250% in 50 years. South Asia, which includes India, has a population of 1,633 million, an increase of 185% in 50 years. East Asia and the Pacific, which includes China, is the most populated region in the world with a combined population of over 2.2 billion. The population growth rate in that region is slightly more than half that of South Asia but still higher than in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Eastern Europe and Central Asia, while covering a large proportion of the planet’s territory, only increased their population by 33% in 50 years. These regions currently have a total population of only 890 million. The growth rates show that population growth is highest in the poorest regions of the world, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa,

Many of the poorest countries in the world have not only become poorer relative to the richer countries, but they have also become poorer than they initially were in 1980. This includes some large African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. Countries in the Middle East and North Africa have had rather low growth rates. Saudi Arabia has had a negative growth rate despite the surge in oil revenues resulting from the 1973 oil embargo placed on Western nations by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), from which Saudi benefited tremendously. Algeria and Mauritania have had growth rates close to zero. Egypt and Morocco have had the fastest growth, but only at an average of 2. % and 2% per year respectively. Latin America has had a lackluster growth performance in the last 30 years with Chile ( .15%) and the Dominican Republic ( . %) being the only exceptions. Most countries in the region have had an average growth rate between 1% and - %. The 1980s have often been referred to as a lost decade for Latin America because the region struggled with large foreign debts in a decade of high real interest rates and many countries underwent structural adjustment programs supervised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Population Growth When considering the evolution of the development gap, population growth is also a relevant variable. Population growth should contribute to GDP growth because a larger population increases the labor force. However, if output growth is slower than population growth, GDP per capita will tend to fall. In addition, if population growth is larger in the poorer countries, the proportion of the poor in the world population will increase more over time. In other words, there will be more and more people on the wrong side of the development gap. Figure 9 shows the population in various regions of the world in 2010 as a multiple of the population in 1960. The world’s poorest region, sub-Saharan Africa with a current population of 854 million, has had the highest population growth. In 2010, its population was 3.7 times larger than 50 years ago. The Middle East and North Africa, with a population of 383 million, had the next highest population growth, increasing by more than 250% in 50 years. South Asia, which includes India, has a population of 1,633 million, an increase of 185% in 50 years. East Asia and the Pacific, which includes China, is the most populated region in the world with a combined population of over 2.2 billion. The population growth rate in that region is slightly more than half that of South Asia but still higher than in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Eastern Europe and Central Asia, while covering a large proportion of the planet’s territory, only increased their population by 33% in 50 years. These regions currently have a total population of only 890 million. The growth rates show that population growth is highest in the poorest regions of the world, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, 


Poverty and Inequality Roughly one quarter of the world population currently lives on less than 1 dollar a day. About half of the world population lives on less than 2 dollars a day. How can families live on such a meager amount? Picture life in Beru village in the southwest corner of Haiti. The terrible earthquake of 2010 that hit Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, is still vivid in the residents’ memories and media coverage of the disaster revealed to the world the conditions of extreme poverty in Haiti. Beru village is a dayand-a-half hike from the town of Les Anglais and it is very difficult to reach. Although the villagers enjoy views of nature’s beauty, poverty is pervasive. People live in small tin-roof or thatched-roof huts with walls made out of woven wood and surfaced with a mixture of dung and mud. These 200-square-foot huts house extended households that average 10 people. There is no electricity, no plumbing, and the nearest source of water is a polluted spring 2 hours walk from the village. Avocadoes are one of the main sources of food, so hunger is less prevalent in the village than in the slums of Haitian cities where, even before the earthquake, children were fed mud-laced cakes to ease their hunger. In Beru, the school is nothing more than a tin roof on concrete pillars with a partial wall. The children sit on the dirt floor. They have neither school materials nor even a teacher. They sit there for the duration of the school day and the older children take care of the younger ones. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its richest citizens have been enjoying living standards that are equivalent to those of the most affluent Americans. Living in secluded villas, rich families have, in the past decades, been able to accumulate large fortunes. Most of their wealth was sent abroad and deposited in foreign banks during the ultra-repressive regimes of the Duvalier family, first that of father “Papa Doc” who ruled between 1957 and 1971 and then that of his son “Bébé (Baby) Doc” between 1971 and 1986, until he was overthrown by a popular uprising. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a priest who tried to defend the interests of the poor, was elected president in 1991. However, the rich families of Haiti were still very powerful and were able to oust Aristide through a military coup. He was again elected president in 2001 and overthrown yet again in 2004. This is an example of how extreme poverty and income inequality contribute to instability and political unrest in poorer nations. E conomists have been studying poverty for many years and have devoted great effort to developing tools to measure poverty accurately. In the first part of this chapter we will examine the tools for defining and measuring poverty on our planet. We will ask: How has poverty evolved over time? What are the trends in various geographic regions? In the second part of this chapter, we will examine economic inequality in developing countries.

The Development Gap lent money to firms but also held equity in industrial enterprises. Universal banking played a very powerful role in using a bank’s assets to finance large investments that allowed German industry to enjoy the economies of scale and grow very rapidly. As Figure 11 shows, German income per capita was around 60% of the UK level until the last decade of the 19th century when it started to increase, reaching close to 80% by World War I. After World War II, the German economy recovered very quickly from the devastation that followed Hitler’s defeat and started growing faster than the British economy, overtaking it by the end of the 1960s. The German economy began to slow down relative to the United Kingdom around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German unification in 1990. The famous economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron, who studied the history of industrialization processes, put forward the idea of “the advantages of backwardness.” 1 His thesis was that although latecomers to the industrialization process would have to compete with the early industrializers who did not face any competition, they could nevertheless achieve a faster process of industrialization that would eventually allow them to catch up with the early industrializers. First of all, a latecomer could imitate already existing technologies. Then, if that country could achieve the necessary economies of scale, it 1 Alexander Gerschenkron, Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1962).

Economic Growth We can decompose the growth rate of national output ( g Y = dY t / Y t dt ) into three elements: 1. the growth rate of capital multiplied by weight a ; 2. the growth rate of the labor force multiplied by weight (1 a ); and 3. parameter a, called the growth rate of total factor productivity . Total factor productivity is defined as the part of output that labor and capital cannot explain. It is usually thought to be the result of technological progress. Indeed, if innovations allow the production of twice as much of a given product with the same quantity of labor and capital, the innovations would show up in the estimate of total factor productivity. A higher level of output not caused by capital or labor may also be the result of institutional reforms or other aspects of the economy unrelated to capital accumulation and population growth. While technical progress may indeed lead to increases in factor productivity, it is not necessarily the only or even the main cause of increases in factor productivity. As we will see later in this chapter, institutional improvements may be a major cause of increases in total factor productivity. Growth accounting makes it possible to estimate total factor productivity in a country year after year. If we know g Y , g K , g L , and the capital share a , we can compute a. Take the case of China between 2000 and 2005. Its GDP grew at an average rate of 9. %. Capital grew at an average rate of 12. % and labor at a rate of 1%. Given an estimated share of capital of 50%, TFP growth is equal to 9.5 .5 * 12.6 .5 * 1 = 2. . In other words, 2. % of the 9. % growth rate, nearly one-third, is explained by total factor productivity. Total factor productivity tells us a lot about a country’s growth. Some countries have a very high capital accumulation but small growth in total factor productivity, while others have an opposite situation. Capital accumulation and population growth are without doubt an important source of growth in most countries, but, as we will see later in this chapter, the biggest variation among countries is total factor productivity. To understand growth further, we need to consider all three sources of growth. We do this by looking both at the main theories of growth and at empirical research on growth as a means to determine why growth rates vary so much across countries. The Neoclassical Solow Growth Model Robert Solow developed the neoclassical growth model for which he received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1987. 7 It is called the neoclassical growth model because it assumes competitive markets and a diminishing marginal product of capital. It easily links the production function with savings, investment, population growth, and technical change. 7 Robert M. Solow, “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 70, no. 1 (1956): 65-94.

Economic Growth state k * to the right. These are the period-by-period increases in capital intensity. These increases get smaller and smaller as we approach the steady state. The lower the initial level of capital intensity, the larger the initial increases. As capital intensity determines income per capita, large increases in capital intensity result in high increases in income per capita. Growth is thus higher the lower capital intensity is relative to steady state capital intensity, and it decreases gradually as it gets closer to the steady state. The economic reason for this decrease relates to the diminishing marginal product of capital. The marginal product of capital is higher in economies where capital is scarce and capital intensity low. Consequently, growth should be higher in economies where the initial level of capital intensity is low. Diminishing returns to capital thus influence the growth path of a country. Technological Progress and the Steady State An increase in total factor productivity in the Solow model can offset declining growth rates as capital intensity increases. To represent this case, we assume that A increases over time instead of remaining constant. We saw in steady state equation (22) that the steady state capital intensity increases with total factor productivity. Figure 3 illustrates this case. An increase in A from A 1 to A 2 leads to an increase in steady state capital intensity from k * 1 to k * 2 . We can understand this shift from A 1 to A 2 as technological progress that arrives exogenously. Technological progress means the introduction of new machines, new equipment, or new forms of organization that make it possible to increase output at a lower cost. In terms of the Solow model, if the economy is at a level of capital intensity k t below k * 1 , then the increase in technical progress makes the economy move further away from the steady state, leading to higher growth. FIGURE 3 Technological Progress in the Solow Model (1 H δ ) k t h sA 1 k t α (1 H δ ) k t h sA 2 k t α Output per capita Capital intensity k t k 2 * k 1 * y t Technological progress in the economy leads to a shift from A 1 to A 2 , which leads to an increase in steady state capital intensity from k 1 * to k 2 * .

Poverty and Inequality Equal versus unequal income distribution. Consider two extremes, a completely equal and a completely unequal distribution of income, extremes that are depicted in Figure 2. With a perfectly equal income distribution, everybody would have the same income. In that case, 20% of the population would have 20% of total income, 40% would have 40% of total income, and so on. The Lorenz curve would be identical to the diagonal line in Figure 2. What does a highly unequal distribution of income look like? Imagine that the first 99% of the population have no income and that all the income was held by 1% of the population. In that case, the Lorenz curve would be completely flat until it reached the 99% population threshold, at which point it would spike up to 100%, as shown in Figure 2. In other words, it would look like a flat horizontal line followed by a vertical line just before 100%. In reality, we will never encounter these extreme forms of income distribution. Nevertheless, they give us an idea of what an equal and an unequal distribution of income would look like on the Lorenz curve. The Gini coefficient. How can we use the information provided by the Lorenz curve to compare different distributions of income in different countries? Suppose that one Lorenz curve is close to the diagonal and that another is a more horizontal line. We know that the latter represents a more unequal distribution of income. However, comparing two countries might be more difficult if the Lorenz curves cross each other. How do we determine which country has a more unequal income distribution? How can we use all the information about income distribution to compute a single number that enables us to compare inequality across countries?

Poverty and Inequality they tend to declare that the whole village is poor. In these situations, the incentives faced by villagers may cause surveys to overestimate the extent of poverty. Calorie counting. Another approach for estimating poverty involves calorie counting, determining the minimal cost of 2,000 calories worth of food per day, the average daily number of calories humans need. Because poverty has always been associated with hunger, obtaining enough food to survive is the very first economic priority for poor households. How does a poverty calculation based on calorie counting work? First, the researcher determines the caloric value of an ounce of food, be it rice, beans, or chicken. Then, the researcher finds the calorie count of a dollar’s worth of these different types of foods to see how many calories a dollar of rice buys, how many calories a dollar of chicken buys, and so on. For example, an ounce of chicken contains roughly 50 calories. Say that a dollar buys a pound (16 oz) of chicken. A dollar thus buys 16 * 50 = 800 calories. The next step is to take the foods that buy the most calories for the same price and calculate how much it costs to buy the equivalent of 2,000 calories. In other words, economists try to find the diet that “buys” 2,000 calories the cheapest. This then determines a level of income below which people are considered poor. This calorie count is sometimes adjusted for gender and the type of work people do. For example, men doing hard physical work farming or fishing may need more than 2,000 calories per day, while women who work in the service sector may need less. The calorie counting approach to measuring poverty puts significant constraints on people’s diets. The cheapest way to get 2,000 calories is a mixture of beans and rice (or other legumes or cereal grains). While this combination might be the cheapest way to evade hunger, we cannot expect people to live on such a diet every day of their lives, and must take into account nutrition, food preferences, availability of diverse food choices, and eating habits. Poverty line. A less stringent approach than calculating the cheapest basket of food that provides 2,000 calories is to look at the food basket people actually buy and calculate how much income is necessary to buy the equivalent of 2,000 calories of those foods. The poverty line is the income required to purchase 2,000 calories of food, taking into account food habits and preferences. Those families or individuals with income below the poverty line are considered poor, whereas those with income above that line are not. A related statistic is the poverty headcount, the number of people in a given population who are below the poverty line. The poverty headcount ratio is the proportion of that population that is below the poverty line. If N is the population of a country and Q is the poverty headcount, the poverty headcount ratio, denoted as H, is H = Q / N . The poverty line is a useful measure because all of those people below the poverty line are expected to be the most vulnerable to increases in food prices that can threaten their very survival. In practice, the calculation of the income necessary to purchase 2,000 calories of food is rarely updated on a regular basis. Instead, the poverty line is typically updated by adjusting for inflation. In other words, if the cost of living increases by 5%, economists will increase the poverty line by 5%. This is not an accurate method because the basket of goods used to calculate the consumer

The Role of Credit Markets in Development poor, the community is usually able to come up with a sum to repay the bank in case of default by one person. In addition, monitoring is done by the people in the village or neighborhood who are jointly liable for the loan. They have an incentive to ensure that no members of the group default or make bad decisions because everyone would suffer the consequences. Local ties are thus used to monitor and discipline those who make use of the microcredit loans. A third characteristic of microcredit is called progressive lending . A group may initially receive a rather small loan, but the size of the loan can increase over time as the group demonstrates its reliability as it pays back the original amount. The size of the loan can thus become progressively larger. Finally, a fourth characteristic present in most microcredit contracts is a very strict and regular reimbursement schedule. As soon as a loan contract is signed, repayment begins immediately and payments are often made on a weekly basis. Incentive Properties of Microcredit In numerous publications, economists have analyzed the specific features of microcredit contracts. We will now discuss some of the most important incentive properties of these contracts. A first incentive effect is that microcredit helps to prevent moral hazard. Recall that when discussing moral hazard, we assumed that the borrower could either choose a safe or a risky project. In the example used in this chapter, the borrower has an incentive to choose the risky project because limited liability artificially increases that project’s expected return to the borrower, whereas in reality the safe project has a higher expected return. With group lending, members of the group are liable for the individual borrower’s choices and thus have the incentive to do everything they can to pressure the borrower into choosing a safer project. To illustrate the importance of incentives to microcredit lending, let us again consider the example previously discussed in this chapter. The safe project would yield 150 for an outlay of 100 and the risky project would yield 280 with 50% probability and zero with 50% probability. Assume that the interest rate is equal to 10%, so that 110 must be paid back after the return on the project has been realized. Remember that with limited liability, the net payoff to the borrower for the risky project would be 0. (280 110) = 85, while the net payoff for the safe project would be 150 110 = 40. Now assume a group with two borrowers, A and B. Also assume that if one of them fails, the other must pay 100 as part of the joint liability contract. Say that A chooses the project and that B is liable (the converse reasoning will, of course, also hold). A gains 85 40 = 45 from choosing the risky project over the safe project. However, B is expected to lose 50. As a result, B, who can observe A’s choices, would thus be prepared to pay up to 50 in order to convince A to choose the safe project and could possibly do so by offering to pay A a sum above 45. Joint liability effectively creates incentives to choose the safe rather than the risky project and is thus good protection against moral hazard. A second incentive effect is sorting borrowers into risk groups, with those individuals preferring less risk forming a group that will not accept potential borrowers inclined to take on riskier projects. Borrowers favoring more risk

Economic Growth For innovation incentives to work properly, innovators must expect monopoly rents , i.e., extra profits derived from monopoly status. Perfect competition would otherwise eliminate the incentives to innovate. What does this mean? Suppose that an entrepreneur wants to invest in research on a new household refrigerator that requires very little energy and is relatively inexpensive. We can easily imagine that there would be a large market for such a product. However, the entrepreneur must take significant risks and invest large sums of money in research before a good product design is developed. The research may not be successful and, even in case of success, the demand may be disappointing. Assume that in case of a successful design, other firms will immediately copy it and enter the market for the new refrigerator. The innovating firm and the competing firms will both offer lower prices to consumers up to the point where they are barely breaking even. This is usually what happens in a situation of perfect competition. If such future cutthroat competition is to be expected, the entrepreneur may decide that it is not worth investing the money in research for the new product because there will not be adequate future profits to recover the fixed cost of investment. If, on the other hand, in case of successful research, the innovating firm receives a patent giving it exclusive rights to produce the new refrigerator for a number of years, the firm will reap monopoly profits during that period. The prospect of those monopoly profits will make it worthwhile to invest in research and innovation. Acquiring temporary monopoly rights leads to imperfect competition but provides incentives to innovate. The idea that imperfect competition is necessary for innovation was put forward by Joseph Schumpeter, the famous Austrian economist (1883-1950) who taught at Harvard in the 1930s and 1940s. Schumpeter saw innovation by entrepreneurs as the most positive force of capitalism and the source of economic growth, and he understood that the search for monopoly profits was a key motivation of entrepreneurs. It is important to note another important difference between the Solow neoclassical growth model and the endogenous growth model: the Solow model assumes perfect competition, in which factors are paid according to their marginal productivity and capital accumulates until the marginal product of the last unit of capital invested is equal to the interest rate or rental price of capital. In the endogenous growth model, innovators are motivated by the possibility of generating monopoly profits with their innovation. Imperfect competition is necessary for growth in the endogenous growth theory. Monopoly profits associated with innovations are usually temporary. Society has to strike a fine balance between the incentives of innovators and the benefits to society from making technological knowledge widely available. One thing is certain: not protecting innovations or protecting them for too long are not optimal situations. The time frame for temporary protection of innovations is studied in the theory of industrial organization or in the theory of intellectual property rights. 15 15 See, for example, Jean Tirole, The Theory of Industrial Organization (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1988); and Suzanne Scotchmer, Innovation and Incentives (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006). 


Economic Growth One of the key ideas of endogenous growth theory is the difference between human capital and knowledge. Because human capital can only exist in people, in the long term it cannot grow much faster than the population. In a country where the educational level is low, progress made in providing the population with a better-quality education will lead human capital to grow faster than the population, but in a country where high-quality education is already widespread, human capital cannot grow faster than the population. When people die or become unproductive because of old age or disability, their human capital will become idle. Knowledge , unlike human capital, is not necessarily embodied in people. It exists in books, files, archives, patents, computer code, and in various other forms that humans can store. In principle, knowledge can grow boundlessly and can accumulate indefinitely. The only constraint to the accumulation of knowledge is that people have to produce it through research. Growth of knowledge is thus constrained by the number of people doing research. Production of knowledge depends on the existing body of knowledge. Modern medical researchers who exploit the latest advances in genetics are more productive than were medical researchers at the beginning of the 20th century who did not even know about antibiotics. Research productivity can thus increase because new ideas develop from the existing body of knowledge. In endogenous growth theory, the more knowledge there is in the economy, the higher its growth rate. Knowledge as a Non-Rival Good Knowledge is not just any type of economic good; it is a non-rival good , or a good that can still be consumed by the seller even after it is sold. Most normal economic goods are rival goods; once they are sold, the seller can no longer consume them. In contrast, the seller of knowledge still keeps it even after selling it. However, knowledge is also an excludable good , which means a seller can exclude others from its consumption. Many public goods are both non-rival and non-excludable. A country’s army provides the public good of defense. One cannot exclude particular members of the public from the good provided by that defense. People can, however, be excluded from access to knowledge. Secrecy rules, patents, and intellectual property rights are all means to prevent access to knowledge. Keeping knowledge hidden from others is not always easy. For example, music can circulate illegally even when it is protected by copyright laws. The same is true for computer software programs and all other forms of knowledge. The possibility of excluding others from access to knowledge is important to understanding how the creation of knowledge works. Knowledge in the economy progresses via incentives to innovate. Entrepreneurs develop an idea that will improve a particular technology by either lowering costs for producers or delivering a new product to consumers. Entrepreneurs innovate in the hope of receiving the maximum amount of money from their innovations. This maximum profit is possible only if they can prevent others from copying their innovations and making money from them. Copyright and patent laws protect the knowledge created by innovators by preventing others from using this knowledge.

Poverty and Inequality Poor countries usually have low prices for non-tradable goods because of the low wages in those countries. We know that the price of a haircut is a common example because the technology and skills needed for a haircut are roughly the same all over the world. The price of a haircut in richer countries is more expensive than in poor countries because the wages of a barber or hairdresser, the main cost, are higher compared to the wages in poorer countries. For example, the price of a haircut in the United States is about $20, but in India you can easily get a haircut for 20 rupees, which is roughly 45 cents using the market exchange rate of 45 rupees for 1 dollar. This example of the significant difference in the prices of non-tradable goods in developed and developing countries explains why it is impossible to live anywhere in the United States for 1 dollar a day, while in the poorest countries, it is possible to purchase more goods and services with the equivalent of 1 dollar in local currency. Tourists traveling to poor countries often find that goods and services are “cheap” relative to their home country for this same reason. The same is true when comparing prices of non-tradable goods between developing countries. For example, the prices of non-tradable goods are likely to be higher in Brazil than, say, in Congo because income per capita is higher in Brazil. A comparison of Brazil’s and Congo’s poverty lines using the exchange rate would thus tend to underestimate Brazil’s poverty headcount or overestimate Congo’s poverty headcount because the prices of non-tradables are lower in the latter country. Purchasing power parity. Because the market exchange rates of poorer developing countries are based only on imports and exports do not incorporate differences in the prices of non-tradable goods, how can we meaningfully compare living standards of the poor across countries? We can address this problem in part by computing purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates , which are calculated so that a typical basket of goods in two countries, including non-tradables, would have the same value when using the PPP exchange rate. In practice, PPP indices are based on a large basket of goods and services that are representative of people’s average expenditures: lodging, food, transport, education, health, etc. The idea of purchasing power parity is that the same basket of goods should have the same value in two countries. For example, if a basket of goods is worth $ ,000 in the United States and worth 1,500 ringgit in Malaysia, then the PPP exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Malaysian ringgit should be 1.5 ringgits for 1 dollar. In May 2012, the market exchange rate was 3.03 ringgits per dollar, suggesting an undervaluation of the ringgit relative to the PPP exchange rate. Thus, when making international comparisons of poverty lines, it is best to use PPP indices rather than market exchange rates. That said, PPP exchange rates have limitations, too. They only reflect average living standards in a given country. The actual basket of goods and services consumed by the poor is, in general, very different from the average basket of goods and services consumed in that country, even if it is a developing country. Because of this, PPP exchange rates may not accurately reflect the living standards of the poor. Ideally, we need to compare baskets of goods and services consumed by the very poor across developing countries, but this information is not yet available

Poverty and Inequality Researchers have a variety of different tools for measuring inequality, but we will only cover the most frequently used. Quantile measures. To divide the population of a country into income categories, researchers use quantile measures . Particular examples of quantiles are quartiles (4 groups), quintiles (5 groups), and deciles (10 groups). Researchers frequently compute a quantile ratio , a ratio of the average income in the highest quantile over the average income in the lowest quantile. For example, the ratio of the richest decile over the poorest decile measures the ratio of the average income of the top 10% of incomes over the average income of the bottom 10% of incomes. Similarly, we can compute a quintile ratio (the top 20% over the bottom 20%) or a quartile ratio (the top 25% over the bottom 25%). In Brazil, for example, the quintile ratio is 30, which means that the average income of the top 20% is 30 times higher than that of the bottom 20%. Although quantile measures are easy to compute, they do not use all the available income distribution information. The decile ratio will only use information on the income of the top and bottom 10%, neglecting the 80% who are in between. The quartile ratio uses more information (the top and bottom 25%), but the information is more diluted as it hides information about income distribution among the top or bottom 25%. The bottom 10% might be very poor while the next 10% above them might have a decent income; the average will hide this discrepancy. However, although quantile ratios do not efficiently use income distribution information, they are very useful when information about the whole range of income distribution is poor or unreliable. For example, in some countries, only the wealthy report their incomes and pay income tax; as a result, researchers have then no other choice than to rely on survey data to gather information about the incomes of the poor in order to compute quantiles. For a variety of reasons, using surveys to estimate the incomes of the middle class would likely be even more tricky than for the poor for various reasons. They may be reluctant to accurately report their income or their expenditure patterns are more complex than those of the poor, so they may make more mistakes in reporting expenditures. The Lorenz curve. Economists present information on income distribution graphically with the Lorenz curve , which plots the cumulative income share of different quantiles for the whole range of income distribution, as shown in Figure 1. On the horizontal axis, we rank incomes from the poorest to the richest using quintiles (5 income categories). The Lorenz curve indicates the cumulative share of income held by the cumulative share of the population. In Figure 1, starting from the bottom left, the first coordinates tell us that the bottom 20% of the population only have 5% of total income. The bottom 40% have 15% of total income, which means that the second quintile has 10% of total income. The bottom 60% have 35% of total income, which means that the third quintile has 20% of total income, and so on. How unequal is the income distribution illustrated in Figure 1? How can we use the Lorenz curve to evaluate income inequality in a country?

Poverty and Inequality South Asia has also had a decline in poverty rates. In 1981, the headcount ratio was 59.35% and by 2005, it had decreased to 40.34%. This reflects the reduction in poverty rates in India, the biggest country in South Asia. Given that the decline in poverty rates is less spectacular than in East Asia and that more than half of the planet lives in Asia, South Asia is currently the region of the world with the largest number of poor people. Moreover, the total number of South Asian people below the poverty line has increased from 548.29 million people in 1981 to 595.58 million people in 2005. In Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, poverty has declined more slowly than in other regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 51% of the population was still below the poverty line in 2005, hardly a change from 53.37% in 1981. Sub-Saharan Africa had a lower poverty headcount ratio in 1981 than did East Asia, but by 2005, sub-Saharan Africa had by far the highest poverty rate of any region of the world. Europe and Central Asia is the only region in the world to have had both a relative and absolute increase in poverty, with the poverty headcount ratio increasing from 1.67% in 1981 to 3.65% in 2005. This is the result of the transition process from socialism to capitalism, which has significantly increased poverty primarily in the countries of the former Soviet Union such as Russia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. These increased poverty levels are the result of both a substantial fall in economic output and a large increase in income inequality following the introduction of the market economy in these nations. Measurements and Comparisons of Income Inequality Research on income inequality describes the differences in income and wealth between the poor and the rich. Few people are indifferent to income inequality. Some think it is very important to fight it, while others consider it is a necessary evil for economic development. The causes and consequences of income inequality have been the focus of significant economic research. We will begin our discussion with how to measure it. Measuring Income Inequality Measuring income inequality is not straightforward. How can we compare the situation of a developing country in which 80% of a population is poor but its richest citizens are not much richer than middle-class people, to another developing country in which only 40% of the population is poor but the top 10% are extremely rich and have a “jet-set” lifestyle? Determining which country has the most income inequality is not easy to do. The answer depends on many factors. We need to look at the income distribution as a whole in each of the countries we are examining. Ideally, we would like to use as much information as possible from a country’s income distribution. At the same time, we also want to express inequality in terms of a single number in order to compare inequality across countries and time easily. 


Poverty and Inequality South Asia has also had a decline in poverty rates. In 1981, the headcount ratio was 59.35% and by 2005, it had decreased to 40.34%. This reflects the reduction in poverty rates in India, the biggest country in South Asia.

In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 51% of the population was still below the poverty line in 2005, hardly a change from 53.37% in 1981. Sub-Saharan Africa had a lower poverty headcount ratio in 1981 than did East Asia, but by 2005, sub-Saharan Africa had by far the highest poverty rate of any region of the world. Europe and Central Asia is the only region in the world to have had both a relative and absolute increase in poverty, with the poverty headcount ratio increasing from 1.67% in 1981 to 3.65% in 2005. This is the result of the transition process from socialism to capitalism, which has significantly increased poverty primarily in the countries of the former Soviet Union such as Russia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. These increased poverty levels are the result of both a substantial fall in economic output and a large increase in income inequality following the introduction of the market economy in these nations. Measurements and Comparisons of Income Inequality Research on income inequality describes the differences in income and wealth between the poor and the rich. Few people are indifferent to income inequality. Some think it is very important to fight it, while others consider it is a necessary evil for economic development. The causes and consequences of income inequality have been the focus of significant economic research. We will begin our discussion with how to measure it. Measuring Income Inequality Measuring income inequality is not straightforward. How can we compare the situation of a developing country in which 80% of a population is poor but its richest citizens are not much richer than middle-class people, to another developing country in which only 40% of the population is poor but the top 10% are extremely rich and have a “jet-set” lifestyle? Determining which country has the most income inequality is not easy to do. The answer depends on many factors. We need to look at the income distribution as a whole in each of the countries we are examining. Ideally, we would like to use as much information as possible from a country’s income distribution. At the same time, we also want to express inequality in terms of a single number in order to compare inequality across countries and time easily. 


Poverty and Inequality The latest estimates from the Chen and Ravallion team are from 2008. 8 They use a poverty line of $ .25 a day based on 2005 PPP exchange rates. The data were constructed using 675 household surveys across 116 developing countries spanning the period 1981-2005. Over 1.2 million randomly sampled households were interviewed for the 2005 estimate, a sample that is representative of 96% of the population of the developing world. Table 3 gives Chen and Ravallion’s estimates of the number (poverty headcount) and percentage of the population (poverty headcount ratio) in different regions of the world. In the bottom-right row of Table 3, in 2005, we can see that 25.19% of people on the planet were living below the poverty line, down from 51.87% in 1981. Reduction in poverty was the greatest in East Asia and the Pacific. In 1981, we see that 77.67% of the region was below the poverty line (over a billion people), while in 2005, only 16.78% (slightly over 300 million people) were below the line. In a quarter of a century, poverty has significantly declined in East Asia. A major factor in this decrease is the growth miracle in China. In 1981, we see that 84.02% of the Chinese population was below the poverty line, while in 2005 that percentage was reduced to 15.92%. After East Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa have had the biggest reductions in poverty. The poverty headcount ratios (expressed in percentages) decreased from 7.87% in 1981 to 3. % in 2005, making poverty very marginal in that part of the world. 8 Martin Ravallion, Shaohua Chen, and Prem Sangraula, “Dollar a Day Revisited,” World Bank Economic Review , 2009: 163-184.

Economic Growth size, the firm can ship twice as much cargo, or 3,000 tons. This is an example of constant returns to scale. However, assume that with the same amount of steel and materials used for two vessels, the firm instead builds a boat twice their size. Doubling the length, width, and height of the boat increases the volume by 8 and the business can thus ship much more than twice the amount of cargo. This is an example of increasing returns to scale. Factor Productivity The production function helps us analyze factor productivity , the contribution of each factor of production to output. There are different types of factor productivity, including average productivity and marginal productivity as well as total factor productivity , all terms that we explain in turn. Average labor productivity. A common measure of economic performance is average labor productivity obtained by dividing national output by total employment in the economy, Y t / L t . 4 This number tells us how much, on average, one worker contributes to national output in a given year. We can express labor productivity in terms of the production function: Y t L t = A t K t a L t 1 a 1 = A t ¢ K t L t ≤ a ( ) Notice that average labor productivity is a function of K t / L t , the capital intensity , which tells us how much capital there is per worker. Rich countries that have abundant available capital have higher capital intensity in production than do poor countries. Marginal productivity. Another measure economists often use in economic analysis is marginal productivity, the output increase caused by an additional unit of labor (or capital) in the economy. Newspapers rarely report this measure, but marginal productivity is nevertheless a fundamental concept. We use it in reference either to labor or to capital, calling it the marginal productivity of labor , or the marginal productivity of capital , respectively. We can express the marginal products of labor ( MPL ) and capital ( MPK ) as the partial derivatives of the production function with respect to labor and capital. 5 We obtain this partial derivative by taking the derivative of the production function with respect to labor (or capital). It tells us by how much output increases if we add one unit of labor or capital to the economy. Mathematically, we obtain these expressions as follows: MPL = 0 Y t 0 L t = A t K t a (1 a ) L t 1 a 1 = (1 a ) A t ¢ K t L t ≤ a ( ) 4 In some countries where good access to employment data is not available, economists divide output by the population of working age. 5 Note that since the production function is a function of both capital and labor, the derivative with respect to labor or capital is a partial derivative.

Economic Growth between institutions and growth. This research was described in another famous paper by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson. 23 The correlation between institutions and growth. Acemoglu and his colleagues take a measure of institutions from an indicator called “protection against expropriation risks” averaged between 1985 and 1995. These are data from the International Country Risk Guide produced by a private company, Political Risk Services, to assess the risks that investments will be expropriated in different countries. These survey data are based on subjective perceptions of businesspeople. Many economists use them as a measure of institutions because the data are comprehensive and available for a very large number of countries in the world. The data are, nevertheless, not an ideal measure of institutions because perceptions of a country’s institutions might be tainted by its economic performance. In other words, the observation of poor economic performance in a country might lead the people surveyed to give an overly negative view of institutions in that country. Conversely, the observation of strong economic performance might lead to surveys that are too positive. 23 Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A.

Economic Growth Why should we be interested in the steady state of the Solow model? The steady state is a way to characterize an economy in the long term. In the Solow model, capital intensity will converge over time to the steady state. Why is that? Returning to Figure 2, we start with a level of k t that is lower than k * . That level of k t corresponds to the level of the curve (1 d ) k t + sy t . Take a straight vertical line from k t to the (1 d ) k t + sy t curve. We know from equation (21) that the point reached will correspond to a number (1 + n ) k t + 1 . Since these numbers are equal, we draw a horizontal line until we reach the (1 + n ) k t + 1 line. The point reached corresponds on the horizontal axis to next period’s capital intensity level k t + 1 . We can now draw a vertical line until we reach again the curve (1 d ) k + sy . The new number will be equal to (1 d ) k t + 1 + sy t + 1 . From there, we can draw a horizontal line to the line (1 + n ) k to reach point (1 + n ) k t + 2 . Continuing in this manner, we converge toward the steady state k * . We can repeat the same exercise if we start from a point k t that is above k * . We will also converge toward the steady state. Growth Inside and Outside the Steady State How do we represent the economic growth process with the Solow model? Because productivity stays constant in the steady state, the growth rate of income is necessarily equal to the rate of population growth. Population growth is thus the only variable that affects the growth of the economy in the steady state. This conclusion seems counterintuitive. However, we must remember that it is only true in the steady state. To understand economic growth in the Solow model fully, it is best to think of growth on the path toward the steady state, or the transition growth path. Returning to Figure 2, observe the horizontal moves we make as we progress from an initial low level of k t toward the steady FIGURE 2 Steady State in the Solow Model y t (1 H D ) k t h sAk t α (1 h n ) k t h 1 k t Capital intensity Output per capita k * If capital intensity is below or above steady state capital intensity k * , the economy adjusts and moves along the arrows, with output per capita and capital intensity varying until the steady state k * is reached.

Economic Growth Basic Equations of the Romer Model Endogenous growth models are mathematically more complex than the Solow model. In this section, we examine a partial and simplified version of the Romer model to provide a sense of how it works. We start by dividing the total number of workers in the economy L t between the labor force working in the productive sector L Yt and the labor force working in the research sector L At : L t = L Yt + L At (25) The production function differs slightly from that in the Solow model. Human capital in the productive sector is equal to A t L Yt , the product of the stock of knowledge A t and productive labor. The production function takes the following form: Y t = K t a ( A t L Yt ) 1 a (26) Note that A t varies over time, is endogenous, and depends on innovation. Growth of knowledge in period t is given by: g At = H A t / A t 1 = d L At Another way of reading that equation is to multiply both sides by A t : H A t = A t 1 d L At The increment to knowledge H A t = A t A t 1 is then given by the stock of knowledge multiplied by the labor force in the research sector and parameter d , which can be interpreted as an indicator of the efficiency of research. The insight that additions to knowledge increase with the stock of knowledge is important because countries with a higher stock of knowledge will add more to knowledge than countries with a lower stock of knowledge. 16 Note also that a key implication that derives from these assumptions is that if A t grows just as do K t and L t , there are increasing returns to scale in the economy. The Romer Model versus the Solow Model The Romer model’s predictions are different from those of the Solow model in several important ways: 1. In the Romer model, imperfect competition is necessary for innovation and growth, while the Solow model is based on the neoclassical model of perfect competition. 2. Innovation is endogenous in the Romer model and depends on the stock of knowledge and research and development. It is exogenous in the Solow model. 16 One component of the model that we will not develop here is that the innovation sector that produces knowledge and that sells patents to a sector in which there is monopolistic competition. The latter sector produces inputs for the competitive consumer goods sector. In equilibrium, the labor force in the productive and research sector is then allocated in such a way that the return to labor in both sectors is the same. Note that if labor in the innovation sector grows, knowledge growth will also be higher in the economy.

Economic Growth When we calculate factor shares using the Cobb-Douglas production function, we get quite striking and simple results: MPK . K t Y t = A t a K t a 1 L t 1 a . K t Y t = a A t K t a L t 1 a A t K t a L t 1 a = a ( ) MPL . L t Y t = A t (1 a ) K t a L t a . L t Y t = (1 a ) A t K t a L t 1 a A t K t a L t 1 a = (1 a ) ( ) Notice that the share of capital is equal to its exponent a in the production function and the share of labor is equal to (1 a ). The result is simple and easy to remember: the wage rate and the interest rate may vary over time, and the quantity of labor and capital in the economy may all fluctuate, but in the end, the shares of capital and of labor are given by very stable parameters. This is not simply a result of the particular Cobb-Douglas form for the production function. In reality, factor shares are also very stable. In advanced economies, the share of capital is roughly one-third of total income and the share of labor is roughly two-thirds of total income. The share of capital tends to be somewhat higher in many developing economies. In China, the share of capital has been rising over the years and has been above 40% for many years. In India, it has also been around 40% in recent years. We can use factor shares to estimate key variables of the production function for which there is no systematic data collection, such as parameter a . Because we also usually have data from national economies for L t , K t , and Y t , we can also use these data to estimate MPL and MPK. Growth Accounting The production function is a very useful tool in growth accounting , which estimates what percentage of an economy’s growth rate we can explain using the growth rate of the labor force, the growth rate of the capital stock, and residual factors. Take the Cobb-Douglas production function, but replace A t with e at . This is an exponential function. It assumes that A t grows at a constant rate a over time. The production function is then: Y t = e at K t a L t 1 a ( ) Take the logarithm of that function, remembering that the logarithm of an exponential function is its exponent: Log Y t = at + a log K t + (1 a )log L t (10) If we take the derivative of the logarithm with respect to time (assuming time is continuous), we obtain growth rates: d log Y dt = a + a d log K t dt + (1 a ) d log L t dt 1 g Y = a + a g K + (1 a ) g L

Growth Accounting The production function is a very useful tool in growth accounting , which estimates what percentage of an economy’s growth rate we can explain using the growth rate of the labor force, the growth rate of the capital stock, and residual factors. Take the Cobb-Douglas production function, but replace A t with e at . This is an exponential function. It assumes that A t grows at a constant rate a over time. The production function is then: Y t = e at K t a L t 1 a ( ) Take the logarithm of that function, remembering that the logarithm of an exponential function is its exponent: Log Y t = at + a log K t + (1 a )log L t (10) If we take the derivative of the logarithm with respect to time (assuming time is continuous), we obtain growth rates: d log Y dt = a + a d log K t dt + (1 a ) d log L t dt 1 g Y = a + a g K + (1 a ) g L 


Economic Growth MPK = 0 Y t 0 K t = A t a K t a 1 L t 1 a = a A t ¢ L t K t ≤ (1 a ) = a A t ¢ K t L t ≤ (1 a ) ( ) Note that the marginal product of labor decreases when labor increases. L t is in the denominator of the expression for MPL, so MPL declines when L t increases. The same thing can be said for the marginal product of capital: MPK declines when K t increases. Economically, this means that labor and capital have a diminishing marginal productivity : the more labor (or capital) added to the economy , the smaller the additional output that will be generated. Another useful tool generated by the production function is the “crossderivative,” or the derivative of the marginal product of labor with respect to capital: 0 Y t 0 K t 0 L t = A t a K t a 1 (1 a ) L t a 7 0 ( ) This expression is positive, which means that the marginal product of labor increases when there is more capital in the economy. Adding a worker in a more mechanized firm will add more output than will adding a worker in a less mechanized firm. Similarly, incorporating more mechanization in a firm will make existing workers more productive. Factor Shares Another important concept in production is that of factor shares , the share of national income used as payment for the share of capital (or labor) in production. How do factor shares relate to the production function? In a competitive economy, we know that each factor will be paid its marginal product and that a firm will want to hire labor as long as the marginal product of labor is higher than the marginal cost of labor, or the wage rate. We can use the same reasoning for capital. A firm will want to invest, or add capital, as long as the marginal product of capital is higher than the opportunity cost of capital, the interest rate. 6 Indeed, as long as the marginal product of capital is higher than the interest rate, we get a higher return by investing more capital in the firm than by putting it in the bank. Of course, wages and the interest rate adjust in the economy in response to supply and demand on the labor and capital markets, but in equilibrium, the marginal product of labor and capital will adjust to be equal to the wage rate and the interest rate respectively. Therefore, at the economywide level, total wage payments should be equal to the marginal product of labor times the total amount of labor. Total payment to capital should similarly be equal to the marginal product of capital times the stock of capital in the economy. The shares of labor and capital are thus the payments to labor and capital divided by national income: MPL * L t / Y t and MPL * K t / Y t . 6 The opportunity cost of capital is the interest rate, because instead of investing capital in the firm, we can put it in the bank and earn the market interest rate.

Econometric Appendix the treatment effect correctly. The advantage of counterfactuals is that we not only can look at observed outcomes but we can also consider outcomes that could have occurred but were not observed. Therefore, let us call Y(Z, D) the counterfactual outcome. Given that Z and D each take 2 values, there are four counterfactuals Y(Z, D): Y( 1, 1 ), Y( 1, 0 ), Y( 0, 0 ), and Y( 0, 1 ). The assumption that Z and Y are uncorrelated means that Y ( Z , D ) = Y ( D ). Let us pause to understand what this means. Take a person who was randomly selected for treatment, but for some reason, was not treated. The outcome for that person should not be different than for a person who was not selected. In other words, only the treatment affects the health outcome. This seems natural with a random selection of Z. Another way of saying it is that Z itself does not affect Y. This property will prove useful below. The assumption that Z and X are correlated means that E ( D ( )) is not equal to E ( D ( )). In other words, the expectation of being treated depends on whether the individual was initially selected or not. This assumption will be automatically satisfied if those treated are only those initially selected ( Z = 1), but even if that is not the case, it is reasonable to assume that this assumption holds. Without this assumption, Z would obviously play no role at all and we could forget about it entirely. With these assumptions, we can identify three causal effects: 1) the causal effect of Z on D : D ( ) D ( ); 2) the causal effect of D on Y : Y ( ) Y ( ); and 3) the causal effect of Z on Y : Y ( D ( )) Y ( D ( )). Thus, suppose that individuals were selected randomly for the malaria treatment and that these individuals were surveyed. Also suppose that random disruption in the delivery of malaria vaccines in certain regions prevented those selected from receiving the vaccine. Let us then derive an easy interpretation of the instrumental variable coefficient. Note first that the covariance between Z and Y can be simplified: Cov ( Z , Y ) = E ( ZY ) E ( Z ) E ( Y ) Taking into account the fact that Z and Y are uncorrelated and that Z only takes two values, we get: E ( Y H Z = 1) E ( Z = 1) E ( Y ) E ( Z = 1) = [ E ( Y H Z = 1) E ( Y )] E ( Z = 1) = { E ( Y H Z = 1) [ E ( Y H Z = 1) E ( Z = 1) + E ( Y H Z = 0) E ( Z = 0)]} E ( Z = 1) Taking into account the fact that E ( Y H Z = 1) E ( Y H Z = 1) E ( Z = 1) = E ( Y H Z = 1) E ( Z = 0), we get: { E ( Y H Z = 1) E ( Y H Z = 0)} E ( Z = 0) E ( Z = 1) Similarly, we can derive Cov ( Z , D ) = [ E ( D H Z = 1) E ( D H Z = 0)] E ( Z = 0) E ( Z = 1)

Structural Change and Development Strategies Moreover, in terms of the size of the economies of recipient countries, foreign aid has been substantial. The aid given to the top quarter of receiving countries has been on average equal to 17% of their annual GDP, but with no effect on their growth. On the other hand, the East Asian countries that did have high economic growth, such as China and India, received very little aid compared to all other developing countries. In addition, there is significant evidence that increased aid led to increased consumption, but not to increased investment. Easterly notes that not only was a large part of the aid diverted by corrupt officials, but that if a government received aid, it was less accountable for what happened to the funds because it did not have to secure that money by raising taxes from its population. It was accountable only to the donors who did not monitor closely the use of funds. Even with their noble motives to help developing countries, NGOs also had a vested interest in continuing the existing aid programs in which they were involved, and they were more concerned with renewing existing aid programs than evaluating them. It is only in recent years that various NGOs have taken seriously the need to evaluate the effectiveness of aid programs. Easterly also argues that there is no good empirical evidence for poverty traps in development. The poorest countries 50 years ago did not have the lowest growth rates in subsequent years, a prediction one would expect from the poverty trap argument. What Conclusions Should We Draw about Foreign Aid? A first conclusion we must consider is that governments and NGOs should be cautious about what foreign aid can realistically achieve. If it has not achieved much in the past decades in terms of growth, skepticism is called for when considering what continued aid can achieve without further research into its effectiveness. A second conclusion is that a bottom-up approach is more likely to work better than a top-down approach. It is crucial to find honest people who are ready to spend time and effort on projects that make a difference for the lives of local people. A third conclusion is that in order to avoid wasting aid money, it is very important to have accurate evaluations of development projects that use the best scientific tools available. Much of the resurgence of development economics since the beginning of the 21st century is due to the introduction of randomized controlled trials that use the same scientific approach as in randomized medical experiments. The less we know about what works and what does not work to help local communities develop, the more we need to develop experiments that will help us gain these insights. The Poverty Action Lab at MIT in Cambridge, MA, and the Center for Evaluation of Global Action at UC Berkeley are examples of research centers in top universities that specialize in formulating tools for the evaluation of development projects. More and more governments and NGOs see the need for such fresh approaches to determining the efficacy of foreign aid. 18 Easterly, W. R. (2008). Reinventing Foreign Aid.

Corruption Paolo Mauro was the first to analyze the effect of corruption on growth in an international comparative framework. 11 He used corruption data from a firm called Business International that was related to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). These were data on subjective perceptions of corruption. He found that corruption had a negative effect on the investment rate, that is, the ratio of investment over GDP. This was true in ordinary least square regression as well as in an instrumental variable regression in which ethno-linguistic fractionalization was taken as an instrument for corruption. Ethno-linguistic fractionalization measures the probability that two randomly matched people in a country will not belong to the same ethnic or linguistic group. This fractionalization may be a possible cause of corruption because in countries where it is present, government is jointly managed by representatives of these different groups who do not trust one another, or trust one another less than they would if they were from the same ethno-linguistic group. Because there is less cooperation between the groups, representatives from each feel entitled to divert common resources for their own personal enrichment or for that of their own ethnic group. Because no ethno-linguistic group feels responsible for government as a whole, there is less moral stigma resulting from the diversion of government funds. In Mauro’s research, while the effect of corruption on investment seemed quite significant, the effect of corruption on growth was less robust. Mauro’s work leads to the conclusion that corruption mainly affects investment and, thus as a result, it may have indirect effects on growth via its effects on investment. Shang-Jin Wei examined the effect of corruption on foreign direct investment (FDI). 12 He used the same corruption variable as Mauro, as well as the ICRG and the Transparency International data mentioned above. His basic finding was that the effect of corruption on foreign direct investment was very significant. An increase in a host government’s corruption level from that of Singapore’s (ranked as no. 5 at the time in the Transparency International index, with a very low level of corruption) to that of Mexico’s much higher level (ranked no. 70 at the time), had the same negative effect on the inward FDI as raising the marginal tax rate by 42 percentage points. The evidence we have on corruption both at the microeconomic and at the macroeconomic level thus tends to favor the pessimistic view of corruption rather than the benign “grease the wheels” interpretation. Why Are Some Countries More Corrupt than Others? The fact that some countries are more or less corrupt than others is an important question that is hard to answer in a fully satisfactory way because it requires a true grasp of the precise mechanisms that cause corruption. There are many possible mechanisms as we have discussed above and they are difficult to disentangle. Corruption may be due to local culture that considers it 11 Paolo Mauro, “Corruption and Growth,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 110, no. 3 (1996): 681-712. 12 Shang-Jin Wei, “How Taxing Is Corruption on International Investors?” The Review of Economics and Statistics 82, no. 1 (2000): 1-11. 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development others? This competition will not necessarily be good for incentives. In the absence of commitment, lenders may reasonably expect borrowers to leave the relationship at any moment in order to do business with the competition. In that case, the advantages of progressive lending will be undone and the only force working against default will be the incentive of the borrower to maintain a good reputation. If lenders circulate information among themselves about those borrowers who default, the lenders may agree never to lend to that person or that enterprise again. Reputation would thus reduce the incentive to default. Nevertheless, reputation requires efficient circulation of information, which can be a problem in poor countries. It seems that, in practice, progressive lending works particularly well with women. They respond better to dynamic incentives for at least two reasons. First, they are less mobile. This means that if they default on a loan, they are less likely to run away. Women also have less opportunities to borrow. Microcredit provides a unique opportunity for women in developing countries and because it is more difficult for women to obtain loans from conventional lending institutions, progressive lending works better for them. The very regular payment schedules associated with microcredit might seem counterintuitive. What is the point of borrowing if you have to start repaying the loan immediately? In practice, this feature has proved very useful for screening out undisciplined borrowers and sending early warning signals about problems with a loan or a borrower. It does, however, require borrowers to have some source of income and, when that income is seasonal, as is the case with farmers, meeting those regular payment schedules can be very difficult. Other Forms of Microfinance Microcredit that involves group lending is only one of the various forms of microfinance, methods to finance small loans or investments in developing countries. In one version of microfinance, loan approval is associated with the borrower’s obligation to contribute to an “emergency fund” that serves as a substitute for collateral. A slightly different version found in other types of microfinance contracts is that of a “group tax,” a form of mandatory saving that requires individuals to contribute on a regular basis to a joint fund from which money can only be withdrawn at a future date. In Africa and Asia, a widespread form of microfinance is rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) . No outside financial institution is involved with ROSCAs. In a village, a group of people, usually women, decide to save money together and then lend to the different group members on a rotating basis: one individual receives a loan from the group first; after repayment of the first loan, a second individual receives a loan, and so on. An individual’s place in the rotation scheme is often chosen at random. The ROSCA system is less practical than microcredit because those individuals who can borrow from the savings of others early on in the lending rotation have an advantage as this works for them as an immediate loan, while those who borrow later in the rotation could likely have saved the money by themselves. Nevertheless, the ROSCA does serve as a significant commitment to savings. Because there are regular meetings, each member of the group commits to contributing a certain amount of savings to the association on a regular basis. This is not just a 


Corruption The World Bank produces the other well-known measure of corruption. It is a variable called “coasasntrol of corruption” and is derived from a larger set of indicators than the Corruption Perceptions Index. It includes up to 32 surveys from 30 differenasast organizations as well as the ICRG index. From 1996 until 2004, it was published every 2 years; since 2004, it has been updated every year. Even though it is calculated by a different method than the Corruption Perceptions Index, it is closely correlated with that index. 8 This is not surprising because both measures use many of the same sources. Most of the studies on corruption in recent years have used one of the subjective perception indices (ICRG, Transparency International, or World Bank). While the subjective measures of corruption are more comprehensive than the objective measures, the question of how precise these measures are remains open. One reason why they might have a relatively high degree of accuracy is that if a corruption index is computed from many different indicators, each of which is derived from different sources, the measurement error in these different sources is likely to be independent. As we know from FIGURE 1 Transparency International’s 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index 9. -10 8. - .9 7. - .9 6. - .9 5. - .9 4. - .9 3. - .9 2. - .9 1. - .9 0 - 0.9 No data Highly corrupt Very clean According to the Transparency International index, countries with darker colors and lower Corruption Perceptions Indices (CPI) have a higher level of corruption.

Until 250 years ago, income disparities between countries were much smaller than they are today. Some, like China, were wealthy, but most countries were relatively poor. However, in the last 250 years, the world economy has changed dramatically; some countries have grown vigorously while others have retained living standards from centuries ago. In the second half of the 18th century, Great Britain industrialized its economy, followed in the 19th century by the United States and Europe. Japan, which had been isolated from the rest of the world for centuries and deeply mired in its feudal traditions, started growing very rapidly at the end of the 19th century. As a result of its economic strength, it was able to create a powerful military that defeated Russia’s tsarist army in 1905 and went on to invade and occupy China and large parts of Asia in the 1930s and 1940s. After Japan’s defeat in World War II, its economy continued to develop very rapidly, with GDP growing at 9% on average between 1950 and 1970. Other Asian countries (Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore) experienced rapid growth in the 1960s and 1970s by following the Japanese model of an export-oriented economy. Since the 1980s, China, the most populous country in the world, has had GDP growth of nearly 10% per year. As the Chinese “miracle” has unfolded over the past decades, income per capita has increased by a factor of 10. India has also started to grow vigorously since the end of the 20th century. Underscoring the power of these two emerging economies, India and China together include more than one-third of the world population. It is important to distinguish between economic development and economic growth. Economic development refers to improvements in living standards and in the quality of life, while economic growth measures only growth in economic production. Economic growth may not accurately reflect all aspects of economic development because growth often results in negative effects on the quality of life such as pollution and urban congestion. Nevertheless, economic development cannot take place without economic growth. Growth is thus fundamental to development. I n this chapter, we introduce some important economic concepts to consider when discussing economic growth. We then review two very important theories of economic growth that explain the capital accumulation process. We will show that these theories, and others, based on capital accumulation explain only a small part of the differences in growth among countries. We then discuss the empirical evidence for the main causes of growth and highlight two important explanations for why some countries are so wealthy and others are so poor: geography and institutions. Currently, economists believe that institutions are central to understanding economic performance and economic growth in developing countries. Economic Growth

Corruption Paolo Mauro was the first to analyze the effect of corruption on growth in an international comparative framework. 11 He used corruption data from a firm called Business International that was related to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). These were data on subjective perceptions of corruption. He found that corruption had a negative effect on the investment rate, that is, the ratio of investment over GDP. This was true in ordinary least square regression as well as in an instrumental variable regression in which ethno-linguistic fractionalization was taken as an instrument for corruption. Ethno-linguistic fractionalization measures the probability that two randomly matched people in a country will not belong to the same ethnic or linguistic group. This fractionalization may be a possible cause of corruption because in countries where it is present, government is jointly managed by representatives of these different groups who do not trust one another, or trust one another less than they would if they were from the same ethno-linguistic group. Because there is less cooperation between the groups, representatives from each feel entitled to divert common resources for their own personal enrichment or for that of their own ethnic group. Because no ethno-linguistic group feels responsible for government as a whole, there is less moral stigma resulting from the diversion of government funds. In Mauro’s research, while the effect of corruption on investment seemed quite significant, the effect of corruption on growth was less robust. Mauro’s work leads to the conclusion that corruption mainly affects investment and, thus as a result, it may have indirect effects on growth via its effects on investment. Shang-Jin Wei examined the effect of corruption on foreign direct investment (FDI). 12 He used the same corruption variable as Mauro, as well as the ICRG and the Transparency International data mentioned above. His basic finding was that the effect of corruption on foreign direct investment was very significant. An increase in a host government’s corruption level from that of Singapore’s (ranked as no. 5 at the time in the Transparency International index, with a very low level of corruption) to that of Mexico’s much higher level (ranked no. 70 at the time), had the same negative effect on the inward FDI as raising the marginal tax rate by 42 percentage points. The evidence we have on corruption both at the microeconomic and at the macroeconomic level thus tends to favor the pessimistic view of corruption rather than the benign “grease the wheels” interpretation. Why Are Some Countries More Corrupt than Others? The fact that some countries are more or less corrupt than others is an important question that is hard to answer in a fully satisfactory way because it requires a true grasp of the precise mechanisms that cause corruption. There are many possible mechanisms as we have discussed above and they are difficult to disentangle. Corruption may be due to local culture that considers it 11 Paolo Mauro, “Corruption and Growth,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 110, no. 3 (1996): 681-712. 12 Shang-Jin Wei, “How Taxing Is Corruption on International Investors?” The Review of Economics and Statistics 82, no. 1 (2000): 1-11. 


Poverty and Inequality Income Inequality and Economic Growth What about the relationship between income inequality and economic growth? We begin by determining their relationship, as shown in Figure 7. It plots long-term growth rates of GDP per capita expressed in purchasing power parity between 1960 and 2005 against income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. The data show some dispersion, but there is a negative correlation: countries with a higher Gini tend to have lower growth rates. Since the early 1990s, there has been a near-unanimous consensus among economists that income inequality is bad for economic growth. This consensus is based on empirical research and on various theories predicting that more income inequality is expected to lead to less economic growth. Consider Latin America and Asia. Latin America, the region with the most income inequality, has generally had a rather poor economic growth record in recent decades. Compared to most other regions, it had very low growth in the 1980s and 1990s. Asia, on the other hand, has been relatively more equitable than the rest of the world, both in terms of the distribution of land and the distribution of income, and has experienced very impressive economic growth in recent decades. What are the theoretical explanations for why income inequality may be bad for economic growth? Credit market imperfections. One explanation is related to credit market imperfections. If a country’s poor are numerous and unable to borrow in order to engage in entrepreneurial activities, economic growth will be limited. Consider two economies, one that has very unequal income distribution with many poor who cannot borrow, and another with fewer poor and a larger pool of people who are able to borrow. Because people in the economy with more FIGURE 7 Income Inequality and Economic Growth H 2.00 H 1.00 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 0.4 0.6 0.7 Gini G rowth of GDP per capita (PPP) 1960 H 2003 0.3 0.5 0.2 0.8 Countries with a higher income inequality (a higher Gini coefficient) also have a lower long-term growth rate of GDP per capita.

Poverty and Inequality Inequality, Growth, and Development What is the relationship between economic development and income inequality? Is income inequality good or bad for growth? Conversely, how does economic growth affect income inequality? If we can identify a relationship between income inequality and economic growth, what is the direction of causality? How has income inequality evolved in the world? We will address these questions in this section. The Kuznets Hypothesis We must first analyze the evidence from economic literature for a relationship between economic development and income inequality. A famous hypothesis developed in 1955 by Simon Kuznets, an American economist who received the Nobel Prize in 1971, states that income inequality at first increases with economic development but later decreases as countries become wealthy. The reason why income inequality increases first is that only part of society grows out of poverty at initial stages of economic development. As some people become richer and others remain poor, income inequality must inevitably increase. Eventually, however, the effects of economic growth “trickle down” to the poor, whose living standards also increase, and inequality declines as a result.

Corruption The fact that culture appears to play an important role in corruption is consistent with a constant theme in this chapter: corruption is a long-term phenomenon. Cultural norms are slow to change and if corruption is, to a large extent, driven by culture, it can only experience consistent improvement over time if social norms change by establishing moral prohibitions against corrupt practices. The Difficulty of Fighting Corruption That corruption seems to be determined by long-term factors is corroborated by the reality that it is very difficult to fight corruption; anticorruption programs are usually not successful. The most common methods for fighting corruption are 1) to devote more resources to the legal apparatus to identify and punish corruption and 2) to launch anticorruption campaigns. The idea is that more rules, better enforcement of those rules, and stricter monitoring will deter corruption. This is often more difficult than it may initially seem. If corruption has permeated all levels of government, how can we assume that by giving more resources to some levels of government, there will be less corruption? It is possible that those authorities who are asked to fight corruption are themselves corrupt. As an example, Jonathan Hay and Andrei Shleifer found that when elite units of the Russian police received better weapons to fight the Russian Mafia, police officers quickly resold those weapons on the black market, primarily to the Mafia, but at a higher price. 25 Few Success Stories, but Can We Generalize? Two success stories in the fight against government corruption that are often cited are Hong Kong since the 1970s, and Singapore since the 1980s. A common element in both examples is that a powerful independent anticorruption agency was set up with enormous authority: the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in Hong Kong and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in Singapore. 26 These agencies were given powers that would not, however, be acceptable in democratic regimes, such as shifting the burden of proof from the prosecutor to the accused. Similar reforms have usually been recipes for the abuse of power. In Singapore, civil servants’ pay was increased, their jobs were rotated often to prevent them from forming collusive and corrupt ties with clients, they received rewards for turning in clients who offered bribes, and much of the bureaucratic red tape that invites corruption was scrapped. In both Hong Kong and Singapore, a strong commitment to fight corruption paid off. South Korea is often cited as another positive case study. The regime of dictator Syngman Rhee (1948-1960) is usually cited as having been very corrupt 25 Jonathan R. Hay and Andrei Shleifer, “Private Enforcement of Public Laws: A Theory of Legal Reform,” The American Economic Review 88, no. 2 (1998): 398-403. 26 Robert Klitgaard, Controlling Corruption (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988).

Corruption The tradition of the waq f in Islamic countries calls for affluent private citizens to organize and fund public services for society at large. If most public services are privately funded, payments from private citizens to other private citizens who are providing those services are not considered corrupt. Just as commissions are expected in private contracts, why should they be inappropriate when private citizens provide public services? While we recognize that different cultures have different social norms, there is not enough understanding in the Western world of other cultures, their value systems and beliefs, and the historical experiences that have influenced them. It is not only important that we understand other cultures, but it is critical that we do so without paternalistic and condescending attitudes. It would be completely wrong to think that the cultural history of other nations is nothing more than just one long path toward Western values. Just as we appreciate food from other cultures, as globalization progresses, we must strive to engage in more cultural exchange and increase our knowledge and appreciation of the world’s diverse cultural norms. Disentangling Culture from Other Institutional Causes of Corruption It is extremely challenging to disentangle the various causes of corruption, many of which are linked. For example, what are the effects on corruption of legal and political institutions as well as culture? If a given culture is more permissive of corruption, it is likely that this will also be reflected in its legal system. Disentangling legal and cultural effects would thus be very difficult. Ray Fisman and Edward Miguel have done some interesting and ingenuous research to disentangle cultural effects on corruption from other institutional effects. 23 Because the United Nations is headquartered in New York City, diplomatic personnel from around the world are stationed there. These diplomats and their families benefit from diplomatic immunity, which, until November 2002, even exempted them from paying parking fines. In their research, Fisman and Miguel examined the differences between diplomats from different countries in terms of illegal parking behavior. They used the extent of illegal parking behavior as a measure of a culture of corruption. Because diplomatic immunity protected the diplomats from legal sanctions, parking behavior was entirely driven by social norms. Those who abided by the law did so not because of monetary incentives (fines), but because of social norms that prohibit corrupt behavior and encourage people to abide by the law not only because they fear punishment, but also because they believe that this is morally correct behavior. In cultures that are more accepting of corruption, breaking the law could be the result of a social norm that places some individuals “above the law.” Because of New York’s scarce parking spaces, observing the social norm obviously had a cost. If culture did not matter at all and only financial incentives guided behavior, the researchers should have observed similar behavior across countries, with all diplomats parking illegally. 23 Ray Fisman and Edward Miguel, “Corruption, Norms, and Legal Enforcement: Evidence from Diplomatic Parking Tickets,” Journal of Political Economy 115, no. 6 (2007): 1020-1048.

Corruption argument often invoked in favor of the “greasing the wheels” approach is that bribes are an inducement to accelerate administrative procedures. Those who are more willing to pay to speed up procedures will pay a bribe to do so. The general idea behind this benign view of corruption is that if agents can bargain freely, efficient outcomes will be the result. This is often referred to as Coasian bargaining and is based on the ideas of Nobel Prize-winner Ronald Coase about property rights and bargaining. In this case, corruption is seen as breaking rules that prevent efficient bargaining. The second view on the efficiency effects of corruption is more negative. It is predicated on the fact that a corruption contract cannot be enforced in a court. Therefore, all the problems identified that formal institutions are supposed to solve (in particular, the hold-up and commitment problems) will be present. A corrupt bureaucrat, who extracts bribes from law-abiding citizens and whose powers in a corrupt environment are unchecked, will behave arbitrarily. He will increase the size of the bribes he demands when he feels he can do so and will leave citizens vulnerable and fearful. The argument for speeding up administrative procedures must then be reinterpreted in a more pessimistic way. Bureaucrats may purposefully delay or paralyze normal procedures in order to extract bribes from citizens and businesses. Because corruption is associated with breaking the law, it is important to emphasize here that there is a fundamental difference between the economic effect of taxation and the economic effect of corruption. If we take a benign view of corruption, we could indeed claim that corruption is not any worse than taxation. We could argue that paying a tax or a bribe can lead to the same distortions in allocations. The difference between taxation and bribes is that tax rates are, in principle, established and implemented within a set of laws that are known to all. Tax rates may change and these changes may sometimes be unpredictable. However, there are legal procedures for making these changes; usually, changes in tax rates are decided by a legislature. A citizen who thinks that he or she is being taxed abusively can mount a defense by invoking tax laws. If citizens collectively decide they are being taxed too much, they may vote to replace the politicians with others who are less pro-taxation. With corruption, the situation is quite different; there are no rules for setting the price of a bribe. It depends on the bargaining power and on the arbitrary decision-making power of a bureaucrat or a politician. Bribes are therefore not as predictable. Those who extract bribes are much more predatory because they are less accountable. 9 In the absence of rules that constrain the stronger party and protect the weaker party to a transaction, when corruption is the norm, the “law of the jungle” or the Hobbesian “state of nature” will prevail. High-ranking government officials will abuse their power and oppress the weak. Moreover, the uncertainty generated by the absence of rule will deter investment, whether from domestic or foreign sources. Because corruption breaks the law, it weakens the formal institutions that are supposed to protect property rights and contracts. Corruption is then seen 9 Of course, the difference between taxation and bribes becomes less significant if all branches of government are corrupt and dysfunctional.

Corruption as “rotting the fruit basket.” Observation of corruption, especially if the corruption is unpunished, will encourage further corruption, which then will spread; the observation of widespread unpunished corruption leads people to accept corruption as inevitable. The institutionalist view is particularly critical of corruption because of its damaging effect on institutions. While the two views of corruption have had equal numbers of proponents for a long time, in recent years, the consensus has moved toward the second view. This is, to a certain degree, due to the fact that economists have changed their view of the economy from one where markets emerge spontaneously and create efficient outcomes in the absence of red tape, to one where institutions are important for the protection of property rights and efficient transactions. Corruption and Growth Does corruption inhibit economic growth? This question is directly related to our discussion in the previous section: If corruption is primarily about greasing the wheels, then we should expect it to have a positive effect on growth. On the other hand, if the view that corruption rots the fruit basket is true, we might expect it to have a negative effect on growth. Inefficiencies associated with corruption do not necessarily result in lower growth. They might only result in a lower static output level and have no effect on growth. This distinction is important: increases in efficiency may increase output, but not necessarily the growth of output. In order to show an effect on growth, one must show that corruption must affect either population growth, accumulation of physical or human capital, or total factor productivity. However, it is possible to argue that this is the case. Corruption may hinder investment by firms, and thus capital accumulation, because firms fear being held up by government bureaucrats. Firms may also avoid more productive but irreversible investment, and pursue less irreversible investments that may not be as economically productive, but may protect them from bureaucratic holdup. The choice to enter the informal sector to hide from corrupt bureaucrats is also likely to lead to the adoption of less efficient technologies. Firms may allocate more time for bribing bureaucrats in order to obtain monopoly positions than they do investing in productive technologies. An individual may decide to become a corrupt bureaucrat instead of a productive entrepreneur, which would be bad for economic growth. What does the evidence suggest? There is some micro-evidence that implies negative effects of corruption on growth, but the macro-evidence is less conclusive. Raymond Fisman and Jakob Svensson estimated the effect of corruption on firm growth in Uganda between 1995 and 1997. 10 They found that a 1 percentage point increase in the bribe rate led to a reduction in firm growth of 3 percentage points, whereas an increase of 1 percentage point in the tax rate only led to a 1 percentage point decrease in firm growth. This finding tends to confirm the idea discussed above that corruption is more distortionary than taxation. 10 Raymond Fisman and Jakob Svensson, “Are Corruption and Taxation Really Harmful to Growth? Firm Level Evidence,” Journal of Development Economics 83, no. 1 (2007): 63-75. 


Corruption as “rotting the fruit basket.” Observation of corruption, especially if the corruption is unpunished, will encourage further corruption, which then will spread; the observation of widespread unpunished corruption leads people to accept corruption as inevitable. The institutionalist view is particularly critical of corruption because of its damaging effect on institutions. While the two views of corruption have had equal numbers of proponents for a long time, in recent years, the consensus has moved toward the second view. This is, to a certain degree, due to the fact that economists have changed their view of the economy from one where markets emerge spontaneously and create efficient outcomes in the absence of red tape, to one where institutions are important for the protection of property rights and efficient transactions. Corruption and Growth Does corruption inhibit economic growth? This question is directly related to our discussion in the previous section: If corruption is primarily about greasing the wheels, then we should expect it to have a positive effect on growth. On the other hand, if the view that corruption rots the fruit basket is true, we might expect it to have a negative effect on growth. Inefficiencies associated with corruption do not necessarily result in lower growth. They might only result in a lower static output level and have no effect on growth. This distinction is important: increases in efficiency may increase output, but not necessarily the growth of output. In order to show an effect on growth, one must show that corruption must affect either population growth, accumulation of physical or human capital, or total factor productivity. However, it is possible to argue that this is the case. Corruption may hinder investment by firms, and thus capital accumulation, because firms fear being held up by government bureaucrats. Firms may also avoid more productive but irreversible investment, and pursue less irreversible investments that may not be as economically productive, but may protect them from bureaucratic holdup. The choice to enter the informal sector to hide from corrupt bureaucrats is also likely to lead to the adoption of less efficient technologies. Firms may allocate more time for bribing bureaucrats in order to obtain monopoly positions than they do investing in productive technologies. An individual may decide to become a corrupt bureaucrat instead of a productive entrepreneur, which would be bad for economic growth. What does the evidence suggest?

Corruption statistics, if we add many independent variables, we are likely to get more accurate results. In other words, the aggregate measurement error is likely to be smaller than the measurement error of each of the original sources. But there are reasons to be cautious. It is possible that many of the different indicators used by Transparency International or the World Bank overlap in terms of data sources. Adding data to different indicators that come from the same source does not increase accuracy, which may exaggerate the precision of the corruption indices. Caution is required in any case. There is another problem related to the corruption data: they are subjective perceptions that may be contaminated by other variables such as observations of bad performance. For example, take two hypothetical countries with the same level of corruption, but assume that one country performs better economically than the other. When observers are asked to evaluate the corruption in these countries, their judgment might be influenced by their observations of economic performance. Because of good economic performance, they might infer that corruption is not as widespread as what they observed, or vice versa observation of bad economic performance may lead to an exaggerated perception of the overall degree of corruption in a country. If this is the case, then the subjective data on corruption might be contaminated by economic performance, in which case we should be very careful using statistics to analyze the relation between corruption and economic performance. We might erroneously find a correlation between corruption and economic performance, which would be, at least in part, due to the measurement error resulting from subjective perceptions of corruption that are contaminated by observed economic performance. Greasing the Wheels or Rotting the Fruit Basket? We now turn to the main topic of this chapter: the relationship between corruption and development. Ever since economists have studied corruption in the context of development, two opposing views have come forth. The first emphasizes the positive effects of corruption on efficiency, while the second emphasizes its negative effects. According to the first view, corruption “greases the wheels” of an economy. The idea is that if there are many bureaucratic obstacles to trade and production, a certain amount of corruption that breaks inefficient rules may actually enhance efficiency. This idea was quite widespread during the era of central planning. In a pure central planning system, firms were not allowed to trade with each other outside the plan. Think of a situation in which two firms would participate in a mutually beneficial trade and would bribe a bureaucrat to look the other way. This was seen as “greasing the wheels.” In a free market system, we can find similar examples. Consider a situation in which there are restrictions on the number of taxi licenses issued to keep the prices for licenses up and the number of taxis down. Bribes paid to buy extra licenses should be economically beneficial because they help increase market entry and competition. Another

Corruption decision making. The more corrupt a society is, the less enforcement of laws there will be. The problems do not stop there. As corruption increases, so do the forces that work to undermine formal institutions. In other words, corruption threatens not only the quality of formal institutions, but also their existence. In this chapter, we first consider the different definitions of corruption because it is important to know exactly how corruption is defined in social sciences. Next, we review the existing measures of corruption. We then consider the consequences of corruption for economic development. Next, we will examine the evidence available on the effect of corruption on growth and ask why some countries are more corrupt than others. Corruption is a long-term phenomenon that can have deep roots. Societies do not become corrupt or law abiding simply as a result of policy changes. We will examine cultural explanations of corruption and finally ask why it is so difficult to fight it. What Is Corruption? The word corruption is used in many contexts and the boundaries between corrupt and honest behavior are not always clear. Nevertheless, in economics as well as in social sciences, it is generally accepted that corruption means the misuse of public office for private gain. The focus is thus on public-sector corruption. This definition includes the obvious case of a politician or a bureaucrat taking a bribe in exchange for favoring some special interests, such as a firm bidding to procure goods or services for a government agency or an industry lobbying against environmental legislation. Another example would be a bureaucrat taking a bribe to accelerate the delivery of a license or a permit to a small businessman. In these cases, corruption may lead to possible inefficiencies in public decision making—a government official signing a contract with a less-efficient company or failing to introduce well-crafted legislation. In the case of taking a bribe in return for a license, corruption may not necessarily lead to inefficiency, which can actually be reduced by the prompt, albeit corrupt, delivery of the license. Nevertheless, corruption still plays a role because of the misuse of public office for private gain. The bureaucrat is supposed to do his or her work efficiently without needing to be bribed. Thus, corrupt activities can, in some cases lead to less efficiency, while in other cases, they may result in more efficiency. We return to this distinction later in the chapter. Illegal behavior, that is, breaking the law, is inherent in the definition of corruption as misuse of public office for private gain. As a result, a verdict that finds an individual or organization guilty of corruption will involve legal penalties. Being suspected of corruption can carry electoral or political costs. Note that this definition of corruption excludes corruption within the private sector. Thus, if two suppliers are competing for a contract to deliver some kind of goods to a firm, one of the suppliers may offer the manager of the firm a bribe in order to win the contract. In this case, the manager is bribed to make a decision that may not be in the best interests of the firm. Also, managers sometimes steal money from a firm’s shareholders. These kinds of corrupt practices are not uncommon in the business world; although they are illegal and we can

Economic Growth Growth and Factors of Production When we analyze the sources of economic growth, the first thing we must consider is the contribution made by the factors of production. Factors of Production Consider the output of a firm producing T-shirts. The firm generates output by combining labor and capital (machines, buildings, trucks). Labor and capital are critical factors in the creation of value and in the production of output in an economy. In our example, not a single T-shirt could have left the workshop floor without the combination of labor and capital, which are factors of production . 1 Factors of production are fundamental determinants of output. More labor and more capital allow for more production and contribute to growth. What about the inputs (raw materials, energy, etc.) used to produce the T-shirts? Shouldn’t they also be seen as factors of production? The inputs are not part of the value created by that firm. We define the concept of value added as the value of output minus the value of inputs used in production. The value added in this example is the value of the T-shirts minus the value of the inputs necessary to produce them. Value added is the basis for measuring production in the economy. If we do not subtract the value of inputs from the sales value of the T-shirts, we will count the cotton twice, first as output in the cotton factory and second as input in the T-shirt factory. By calculating the value added of all firms in the economy, we get the value of output produced in the economy as a whole and avoid double counting. Increased output is not simply the result of providing additional labor and capital. An increase in labor will not result in more output in a highly mechanized industry, such as a car factory, while it will generate more output in a firm that uses labor as its primary resource, such as a bakery. The productivity of each factor of production depends on the quantity of the other factor of production used in production. The combination of factors of production not only differs across firms and economic sectors, but also across countries because of differences in factor abundance , the relative availability of the different factors of production. In highly developed countries, capital is usually more abundant than labor and production thus relies more heavily on capital, while in poor countries labor is usually more abundant than is capital. Poor countries have less capital and it is usually of lower quality. 2 A good example that illustrates this difference between developing and developed countries is road construction. In advanced economies, all the steps involved in building roads require the use of specialized machines that create flat surfaces, compact the ground below the road, transport and spread gravel, and 1 In agriculture, land is also a very important factor of production. However, we will not discuss land in this chapter. 2 For example, many used and outdated machines, trucks, and cars often find their way to developing countries, where they receive a second life. The quality of these machines and vehicles is often so bad that they break down and require frequent repairs.

Poverty and Inequality literacy rate and a lower income inequality rate. Note, however, that South Asia has even lower literacy rates than Africa but a much lower rate of income inequality. Latin America, which has the highest rate of income inequality, also has a high literacy rate. Even if there is some relationship between education and income inequality, the reason is unclear. Unequal education may lead to unequal incomes as argued above. However, one can also claim that income inequality generates educational inequality, as the poorest households cannot afford to invest in education. A negative correlation between income inequality and education therefore does not tell us whether low education causes more income inequality or the other way around. Causality between education and income inequality could work both ways. Land Ownership and Income Inequality Another determinant of income inequality is the historic inequality of property ownership. There are significant differences in the patterns of land ownership across continents, with Latin America having an extremely inequitable distribution of land while land distribution in Asia is more equitable. The distribution of land ownership is very important in the context of developing countries in which agricultural production still plays an important role in their economies. As we can see in Figure 5, there is a clear positive correlation between the land Gini, which expresses inequality in land ownership, and the income Gini. Inequality of wealth leads to inequality of income. Those owning relatively large amounts of land will have a very high income while those owning little or no land will have a very low income. Note that many land Gini coefficients are extremely high, suggesting that a very small proportion of the population owns a large part of the land.

Poverty and Inequality headquarters in New York to define the Millennium Development goals. The first Millennium Development goal aims at halving the proportion of people living on less than 1 dollar a day. The World Bank has since then been in charge of measuring how many people live under 1 dollar a day. However, while the 1-dollar-a-day definition is an easy headline grabber, the value of 1 dollar varies over time. Moreover, poverty surveys are not conducted frequently and are fraught with measurement errors, as seen above. In 2001, the World Bank decided to use PPP exchange rates based on the prices of 1993. It also decided to use a definition of $ .08 a day as the international poverty line. Since then, it has systematically used national household surveys in developing countries to find out how many people were living under this international poverty line. Efforts are contiuing to refine and update the definition of the international poverty line as are the World Bank’s efforts to make national poverty surveys as comparable as possible. Poverty Rates in Practice Poverty rates provide critical information for policymakers. If a nation’s poverty rates are increasing, we know that some of its policies are falling short and we should determine how to reverse that trend. If the poverty rate is decreasing, that means a nation’s policies are effective. If we can determine the causes of the decrease, then we can shape existing policy to reduce poverty even more. Here again, we face measurement issues. The basic challenge is how to compare poverty across time. The World Bank uses the well-known measure of 1 dollar a day to measure the poverty line, but prices vary over time. Using 1993 prices, one dollar a day in 2001 represents an income of $340 for that year, but using 1985 prices yields an income of $495 for that same year. While significant research has been done in this area over recent years, there is, unfortunately, still no method for measuring the evolution of poverty over time on which everyone agrees. Chen and Ravallion’s data. Shaohua Chen and Martin Ravallion were the first researchers to publish an authoritative study on international poverty following the definition of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000. 7 They are considered among the world’s best experts on the subject of poverty and have done many of the World Bank’s studies on the subject. The Chen and Ravallion estimates are generally considered the most accurate and the most detailed among poverty studies because they are the only ones that rely solely on household consumption surveys. As we discussed above, these surveys are often not conducted in the same way and their comparability across countries is not perfect. However, the national accounting and income data from developing countries, which had been used very frequently in the past to measure poverty, are now considered by researchers to be even more unreliable than consumption surveys. 7 Shaohua Chen and Martin Ravallion, “How Have the World’s Poorest Fared since the Early 1980s?” World Bank Research Observer 19 no. 2 (2004): 141-169.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development others? This competition will not necessarily be good for incentives. In the absence of commitment, lenders may reasonably expect borrowers to leave the relationship at any moment in order to do business with the competition. In that case, the advantages of progressive lending will be undone and the only force working against default will be the incentive of the borrower to maintain a good reputation. If lenders circulate information among themselves about those borrowers who default, the lenders may agree never to lend to that person or that enterprise again. Reputation would thus reduce the incentive to default. Nevertheless, reputation requires efficient circulation of information, which can be a problem in poor countries. It seems that, in practice, progressive lending works particularly well with women. They respond better to dynamic incentives for at least two reasons. First, they are less mobile. This means that if they default on a loan, they are less likely to run away. Women also have less opportunities to borrow. Microcredit provides a unique opportunity for women in developing countries and because it is more difficult for women to obtain loans from conventional lending institutions, progressive lending works better for them. The very regular payment schedules associated with microcredit might seem counterintuitive. What is the point of borrowing if you have to start repaying the loan immediately? In practice, this feature has proved very useful for screening out undisciplined borrowers and sending early warning signals about problems with a loan or a borrower. It does, however, require borrowers to have some source of income and, when that income is seasonal, as is the case with farmers, meeting those regular payment schedules can be very difficult. Other Forms of Microfinance Microcredit that involves group lending is only one of the various forms of microfinance, methods to finance small loans or investments in developing countries. In one version of microfinance, loan approval is associated with the borrower’s obligation to contribute to an “emergency fund” that serves as a substitute for collateral. A slightly different version found in other types of microfinance contracts is that of a “group tax,” a form of mandatory saving that requires individuals to contribute on a regular basis to a joint fund from which money can only be withdrawn at a future date. In Africa and Asia, a widespread form of microfinance is rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) . No outside financial institution is involved with ROSCAs. In a village, a group of people, usually women, decide to save money together and then lend to the different group members on a rotating basis: one individual receives a loan from the group first; after repayment of the first loan, a second individual receives a loan, and so on. An individual’s place in the rotation scheme is often chosen at random. The ROSCA system is less practical than microcredit because those individuals who can borrow from the savings of others early on in the lending rotation have an advantage as this works for them as an immediate loan, while those who borrow later in the rotation could likely have saved the money by themselves. Nevertheless, the ROSCA does serve as a significant commitment to savings. Because there are regular meetings, each member of the group commits to contributing a certain amount of savings to the association on a regular basis. This is not just a

Poverty and Inequality grown much faster in China than in the United States over the past 30 years. Even though inequality has increased in both countries, combining the data for China and the United States suggests that there has probably been a net decrease in income inequality because of the rise in living standards in China. Economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin has examined the evolution of inequality across the world. 13 His series for the world distribution of income combines information on GDP per capita, a measure of average income, with data from household surveys. This exercise is imprecise by nature, given the data on which it is based. Household surveys are done quite irregularly and are certainly not available for every year or even for every country. For missing years, Sala-i-Martin has used interpolation techniques. 14 Figure 8 shows Sala-i-Martin’s estimate of the evolution of the world distribution of income between 1970 and 2000 as measured by the Gini coefficient, 13 Xavier Sala-i-Martin, “The World Distribution of Income: Falling Poverty and . . . Convergence, Period,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 121, no. 2 (2006): 351-357. 14 Say for a given country we have surveys for quintile shares for 1995 and 2000. We then assume a linear trend between those years to estimate values for 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. Suppose the share of income of the 20% richest is 40 in 1995 and 50 in 2000. Linear interpolation will give 42 in 1996, 44 in 1997, 46 in 1998 and 48 in 1998. We can justify this technique for short intervals because income distribution does not change rapidly. In some countries, only one survey for quintile shares may be available, which makes interpolation impossible. In that case, Sala-i-Martin uses information on the evolution of income distribution from neighboring countries to estimate an evolution. He also uses the same method for countries for which no surveys are available.

The main reason for this trend is the strong growth in China and India, where incomes have been catching up with those of richer countries.

Economic Growth mix, pour, spread, and smooth the asphalt. Since about 2000, China has undertaken an intensive road construction program. However, on many construction sites, hundreds of workers, instead of complex machines, break rocks into gravel while others spread the gravel on the roadbed. Many of the operations that are mechanized in advanced countries are performed by manual labor in developing countries like China because capital is scarce but labor is quite abundant. The Production Function The production function is a mathematical expression of the joint effect of the factors of production on output. Call K t the stock of capital in the economy during year t, call L t the amount of labor, and call Y t output in the economy. The production function is: Y t = F ( K t , L t ) ( ) This production function expressed in equation ( ) is quite general. In this chapter, we will repeatedly use the Cobb-Douglas production function, which takes the following form: Y t = A t K t a L t 1 a 0 … a … 1 ( ) Note that this function takes into account the interdependence of the factors of production, more specifically their interaction. If a firm had either no labor or no capital, its output would be equal to zero, however much it had of the other factor. This is due to the multiplicative character of the function. Note also that A t is a scale factor that links units of labor and units of capital to dollars of output. 3 The Cobb-Douglas production function is a useful function for various reasons. First, it easily models the interaction between capital and labor. Second, as we will see below in more detail, it readily provides expressions for the returns to capital and labor, and for their contribution to the growth process. More importantly, it is a good approximation of the relationship between the factors of production and output at the macroeconomic level. This production function exhibits constant returns to scale , meaning that if we multiply each factor by the same number, output is also multiplied by that number. Suppose we double the size of the labor force and the capital in our T-shirt production example. The assumption of constant returns to scale means that output is also doubled. We could also have a case of increasing returns to scale (output is multiplied by more than 2 if labor and capital are multiplied by 2) or decreasing returns to scale (output is multiplied by less than 2). Mathematically, the assumption of constant returns to scale means that if we multiply all factors by a constant z, then output is also multiplied by z: A t ( zK t ) a ( zL t ) 1 a = z a + 1 a A t K t a L t 1 a = zY t To understand economies of scale, take the example of a shipping business. It has a boat that can carry a cargo of 1,500 tons. With two boats of the same 3 Later in this chapter, we will see that other elements than scale enter into A t . 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development required to allocate at least 40% of their net credit to sectors of the economy designated by the government to have “priority” status. These included agriculture, agricultural processing, transportation, and small-scale industries. The interest rate on priority lending was typically lower than the market rate. In January 1998, the government changed the definition of the small-scale industrial sector. Previously, only firms with a total investment in plant and machinery below 6.5 million rupees were included. The reform extended the definition to include firms with investment in plants and machinery up to 30 million rupees. In January 2000, the reform was then partially undone by a new change: firms with investment in plants and machinery above 10 million rupees were excluded from the priority sector. Thus, from 1998 onward, all firms with investment between 6.5 and 10 million rupees benefited from priority lending, while between 1998 and 2000, firms with investments between 10 and 30 million rupees also benefited from priority lending. These changes provided an opportunity to measure the extent of credit constraints for Indian firms affected by the reform. If there were credit rationing, firms in the category between 10 and 30 million rupees should have benefited from the 1998 reforms and received loans to which they would not previously have had access. After the 2000 reform, they would have lost access to that credit. The additional credit received by these firms between 1998 and 2000 would thus be a good measure of the extent of their credit constraints. Because these were relatively large firms, because lending to large firms is relatively less costly than lending to small firms (see our discussion above on monitoring costs), and because banks needed to allocate 40% of their loans to priority lending, the banks would certainly have been willing to lend to those firms after the 1998 reform. We need some initial theoretical analysis in order to interpret the evidence provided by Banerjee and Duflo correctly. Assume a firm must pay a fixed cost C to start production. Call k the level of investment necessary to produce output represented by F ( k ). We now introduce two definitions: First, if a firm wanted to borrow more than a lender was willing to lend at a given interest r, we would say that a firm is credit rationed . Second, we would say that a firm is credit constrained if the borrower wanted to borrow more than all possible lenders were willing to lend at a given interest r. In order to make those two definitions operational, assume that there are only two lenders, a bank and the “market.” The former lends at rate r b and the latter at rate r m , where r b 6 r m . This assumption reflects the fact that under the priority lending program, firms obtained loans at an interest rate that was lower than the market rate. Figure 1 illustrates the case of a firm that is credit rationed but not credit constrained. The horizontal axis represents k , the amount of capital invested. The vertical axis measures the marginal product of capital F’ ( k ). The marginal product of capital is decreasing and therefore downward sloping: as the firm increases the size of its investment, the last unit of capital adds less to output than the previous unit of capital. Assume that, initially, at interest rate r b , the supply of capital to the firm is limited to k b 0 and that at interest r m , the firm can borrow as much as it wants. The firm is thus credit rationed with the bank, but is not credit constrained because it can borrow as much as it wants on the market. Under those conditions, the firm’s total demand for credit is

Poverty and Inequality We can use the Lorenz curve to construct such a number, which is called the Gini coefficient . It is defined as twice the area between the diagonal and the Lorenz curve. In the extreme case of a completely equal distribution of income, the Lorenz curve will coincide with the diagonal. The Gini coefficient will thus be equal to zero. Now, consider the case of a completely unequal distribution of income. Because the Lorenz curve coincides with the rectangular kink formed by the horizontal axis and the right-hand side vertical axis, the surface below the diagonal thus forms a triangle of surface ½ (1 times 1 times ½). Indeed, both the vertical and the horizontal axes have a measure of 1 (respectively 100% of income and 100% of the population). The Gini coefficient will thus take a value between 0 and 1 (or 0 and 100% if expressed as a percentage). Countries with low inequality of income distribution will have a low Gini coefficient and countries with high inequality of income distribution will have a high Gini coefficient. We can calculate the Gini coefficient in a straightforward way using the information we have on income distribution, as shown in Figure 3. Call S the area below the Lorenz curve. The area between the diagonal and the Lorenz curve is equal to 0.5 G, where G stands for the Gini coefficient. The triangle below the diagonal is equal to ½. Thus, we have 0.5 G + S = 0. . The formula for G is thus: G = 1 2 S . FIGURE 2 Lorenz Curve with Extremely Equal and Unequal Income Distribution Egalitarian income distribution Inegalitarian income distribution 0 0 100 Percent of population Percent of income 100 If everyone in a given population has the same income (fully equal income distribution), then the Lorenz curve would follow the diagonal line. If all income were held by the wealthiest 1% of that population (completely unequal income distribution), the Lorenz curve would be a flat horizontal line between 0 and 99% of income and a vertical line thereafter.

Corruption of conflicting social norms, but the basic point is that they are different across cultures. What is considered socially correct in one culture might be considered socially reprehensible in another. These differences therefore imply that cultural attitudes about corruption vary from culture to culture. 22 The practice of giving gifts is a long-standing obligation in many cultures. Gifts seen as bribes in certain cultures are seen only as acts of politeness in others. In many African and Central Asian countries, kinship and clan loyalties take precedence over any social norm for obeying the law. If someone gets a job as a government official, it is considered his or her absolute duty to use this position to favor fellow clansmen with jobs, funds, and other perks. Western values condemn such behavior, but how do we view the congressman who brings home pork for his constituents? Is this behavior less morally reprehensible? This discussion of cultural differences in social norms does not mean we should be more tolerant of corruption in different countries. However, understanding these differences in social norms helps us to understand better why certain countries may be more prone to corruption than others. Different attitudes about corruption are not only related to social norms. They are also rooted in different historical experiences with government. The Western way of thinking about corruption is rooted in the Western concept of government that, in the last several centuries, has evolved with the emergence of nation-states and the rule of law, a process that predates the establishment of democratic regimes. Western concepts of government are rooted in the modern idea of the law, which is predicated on obeying specific rules. Citizens are supposed to be equal before the law and the law is supposed to be applied equally to all citizens. Corruption conflicts with that concept because it suggests that people can pay to be exempt from the law. If officials are corrupt, it means they are not fulfilling their responsibility to treat all citizens equally according to the law, but are, instead, using their official position for their own private gain and possibly for the gain of those who bribe them. In many other countries, the government and the rule of law did not have the chance to develop as they did in the Western world. When people were subject to the despotic rule of a feudal lord, they were victimized by all sorts of predatory behavior; as a result, they tried to please the feudal lord and avoid his wrath by giving in to his wishes and offering him gifts. If this has been the only type of relationship people have ever experienced with their government, then corruption has another meaning: it is the normal state of affairs, the way things are done because the powerful abuse their power and are expected to do so. For those countries that have known colonial rule under which the colonial authorities governed with the help of local feudal lords, corruption is more the normal state of affairs than the exception. It is not a dysfunction of government, it is how government functions. The concept that government should collect taxes in order to provide public services is also relatively modern and linked to Western concepts of government. In many cultures, it was the social duty ( noblesse oblige ) of the aristocracy and other wealthy citizens to do good deeds and provide charity in the form of roads, schools, hospitals, and so forth. 22 See, for example, Pranab Bardhan, “Corruption and Development: A Review of Issues.” Journal of Economic Literature 35, no. 3 (1997): 1320-1346.

Econometric Appendix dependent variable. Thus, the first coefficient in the first regression ( 0.58) is the effect of annual growth on conflict: 1% more growth reduced the number of conflicts by -.58. The most important thing to consider when looking at coefficient estimates is the level of significance, which is indicated by the number of stars next to each coefficient. Three stars means significant at the 99% level. This means that there is a 99% chance that the coefficient is different from zero. Two stars indicate significance at the 95% level and 3 stars indicate significance at the 90% level. Usually, when a coefficient is significant below the 90% level, we do not consider the precision of the estimate is high enough to be significant. How do we compute the level of significance of a coefficient? Below the coefficient estimate, the standard error of the estimation appears. The smaller the standard error, the higher the precision of the estimate and the higher the level of significance. It turns out that if we take the estimate of the coefficient divided by its standard error, it behaves according to a statistical distribution called the “Student’s t -distribution.” We do not have the space to explain the properties of this distribution, but a rule of thumb used by many researchers is to see if the ratio of the regression coefficient and its standard error is larger than 2. If that is the case, the coefficient is significant. Standard statistical packages such as STATA automatically give levels of significance. Finally, the last rows in a regression table provide some information such as the number of observations or the R 2 , which is a measure of how well the regression explains the dependent variable. The higher the R 2 the better, but it is often small. Below the table, explanatory notes for the reader appear. The regression table above is also useful when considering the difference between OLS and IV regression. A simple regression with civil conflict as the dependent variable and annual economic growth as the independent variable would suffer from the problem of endogeneity. A higher level of conflict might lead to a lower level of growth because of the disruptions in the economy. The causality would then go in the other direction. It might also suffer from a problem of omitted variables. For example, a more stable government might reduce the level of conflict and also have a positive effect on economic growth. To address these concerns, we can use rainfall as an instrument for economic growth. This is a good instrument because rainfall affects economic outcomes in agrarian societies but it is not correlated with conflict. The instrumental variable regressions are presented in columns ( ), ( ), and ( ). Each of these regressions shows that annual economic growth rate has a negative and significant effect on civil conflict. This is evidence that even when we account for endogeneity, there is a causal effect of economic growth on civil conflict. 


Econometric Appendix dependent variable. Thus, the first coefficient in the first regression ( 0.58) is the effect of annual growth on conflict: 1% more growth reduced the number of conflicts by -.58. The most important thing to consider when looking at coefficient estimates is the level of significance, which is indicated by the number of stars next to each coefficient. Three stars means significant at the 99% level. This means that there is a 99% chance that the coefficient is different from zero. Two stars indicate significance at the 95% level and 3 stars indicate significance at the 90% level. Usually, when a coefficient is significant below the 90% level, we do not consider the precision of the estimate is high enough to be significant. How do we compute the level of significance of a coefficient? Below the coefficient estimate, the standard error of the estimation appears.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development would then form their own group. Group lending takes advantage of the tendency of people to self-sort into homogeneous risk groups and provides good protection from adverse selection. But why do borrowers have this tendency to self-sort? Assume that there are four borrowers, A, B, C, and D, and that A and B each have a safe project in which they want to invest. Let us change our example slightly and assume that the safe project would yield 210 with 85% probability and zero with 15% probability. We assume that C and D each have a risky project proposal that would yield, as in previous examples, 280 with 50% probability and zero with 50% probability. If we compare the two projects, we see that the risky one has a higher probability of failure but a higher payoff if it is successful. Note that the expected net return from both projects is the same and is equal to 0.85(210 110) = 0. (280 110) = 85. Will A and B with their safe projects join forces or will they each team with one of the borrowers with a risky project? Assume again that the interest rate is 10%. Assume also that there is a joint liability of 50. A has a safe project; by teaming with B, A would receive 0.85(210 110 0.15 * 50) = 78.625. However, if A wanted to team with C, A would only receive 0.85(210 110 0.5 * 50) = 63.75. The clearest way to look at this is to consider A’s expected cost of teaming with B or C. If A teams with B and is successful, which happens with 85% probability, there is still a 15% probability that B is not successful, in which case A is liable for B’s failure. The expected cost of teaming with B is thus 0.85 * 0.15 * 50 = 6.375. On the other hand, if A teams with C, in case of success for A, there is still a 50% probability that C fails. In that case, A is liable. The expected cost for A of teaming with C is thus 0.85 * 0.5 * 50 = 21.25, which is considerably larger. It is then apparent that A would likely prefer to team with B rather than C. In other words, with group lending, borrowers with a safe project prefer to team with those who also have a safe project rather than with those who have a risky project. It is also the case that those borrowers with a risky project may want to team with those with a safe project. However, it takes two to tango. Borrowers with a safe project will prefer the opportunity to team with those who also have a safe project. Now, couldn’t those with a risky project pay those with a safe project to team up with them? Given the principle of group lending and the effect of sorting, we can demonstrate that this proposition would be too expensive (see the box on the next page on group lending and sorting). In effect, the sorting is done as a result of the pressures created by joint liability: the conservative borrower who teams with a risky borrower is more likely to be liable for any bad returns from the latter’s project. The progressive lending aspect of microcredit also has powerful incentive effects: it creates good incentives to avoid default, eliminates informational asymmetries over time, and reduces risk. Let us review these in turn. First of all, the cost of defaulting on a loan today is higher if you know you could be eligible in the future for a larger loan if you reliably make payments on your current loan. This dynamic incentive is quite strong; why default on $100 today if repayment means you could borrow $10,000 in the future? There are people who would prefer to default in the absence of progressive lending but who would avoid default with progressive lending. Reducing the incentive to default on a loan is a significant advantage of progressive lending.

Corruption Chapter Summary What Is Corruption? Corruption is defined as abuse of public office for private gain. It includes bribes, diversion of public money, and abuse of power to benefit a public official. Because it is illegal, corruption tends to be covert. Measuring Corruption Objective measures of corruption quantify observed acts of corruption such as indictments for corrupt activities. These measures might severely underestimate corruption in countries where police and courts are themselves corrupt and do not prosecute other corrupt officials. Subjective measures of corruption such as the Transparency International index or the World Bank index of control of corruption are more comprehensive and comparable across countries. These measures might however be contaminated by observed economic performance. Countries might wrongly be perceived as more corrupt because of bad economic performance. Greasing the Wheels or Rotting the Fruit Basket? The benign view of corruption is that it helps overcome inefficient regulations and works to improve efficiency. The more pessimistic view that has become more prevalent these days is that corruption creates insecurity of property rights and corrodes formal institutions of the rule of law. Corruption and Growth Empirical studies tend to confirm the view that corruption has a negative effect on economic performance and growth. International studies have found that corruption has a negative effect on growth through a negative effect on investment, both domestic and foreign. Why Are Some Countries More Corrupt than Others? Countries that were more developed as early as 1820 are less corrupt today. There is thus a longterm negative correlation between corruption and development. Corruption correlates with the absence of a long-standing tradition of democratic political institutions, little or no media independence, a lack of transparency in public and administrative decision making, weak or absent civil rights, and insufficient accountability by elected officials and civil servants. The presence of natural resources in a country tends to engender more corruption, while openness to trade is associated with less corruption. Culture and Corruption Diverse cultural norms lead to different moral judgments on forms of corrupt behavior. A country’s cultural norms and the quality of both its government and that government’s interaction with the citizenry play an important role as long-term determinants of corruption. There is empirical evidence suggesting a specific role for culture in explaining corruption. The Difficulty of Fighting Corruption It is not easy to fight corruption because it is a longterm phenomenon and it should not occur in isolation but in conjunction with other institutional reforms and cultural movements. Citizens must develop cultural norms that prohibit corruption and be able to mobilize against it. Eliminating corruption can succeed even in the absence of democracy, as shown by the evidence from Hong Kong and Singapore. However, respect for the rule of law is a critical precondition for successful administrative campaigns against corruption. Key Term rent-seeking

Economic Growth Settler mortality and institutions. When European colonizers spread out to conquer the world, they found that some areas were more inhospitable than others. The Congo, with an abundance of rubber and copper, had very valuable natural resources, but malaria and other tropical diseases were so widespread that it was extremely challenging for Europeans to settle there. Settler mortality was extremely high in the Congo, making it nearly impossible for colonizers to settle down for long periods. The colonizers (in this case, the Belgians) were only interested in extracting the natural resources to sell on the world market. Therefore, they set up extractive or predatory institutions that were intended to exploit the country’s resources. The Belgian colonizers enslaved the Congo’s native peoples and forced them to work on large rubber plantations under harsh conditions that soon caused disease and death among the Africans. While the colonial institutions in the Congo are a clear example of predatory institutions, Europeans also found more hospitable locations for colonies, where settler mortality was lower, such as parts of North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina. Immigrants from all over Europe came to settle in these new territories in the 18th and 19th centuries. Here, the intention was not to steal the natural resources, but rather to put down roots and develop agriculture, commerce, and industry. Because the new settlers emigrated in the hope of improving their own fortunes and those of their children, they sought to establish institutions that would be beneficial for economic development. They did this by improving the institutions of their home countries. For example, the drafters of the U.S. Constitution were very concerned about not reproducing the institution of the monarchy in the newly independent United States. As a result, they established a system of checks and balances to prevent the emergence of an excessively powerful executive branch of government that could expropriate private businesses. Acemoglu and his colleagues argue that differences in settler mortality among the European colonies led to the establishment of different types of institutions. Predatory institutions were established in those areas where settler mortality was high and institutions protecting property rights were established in areas more hospitable to settlers. This difference in the type of institutions established at the time of colonization has had a long-lasting effect on growth in those former colonies. The work by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson has quickly become the dominant view on explaining growth. It has brought institutions to the mainstream of economics. Because of this research, much of the current research in economics tries to understand the role of institutions and their effects on different measures of economic performance. The best way to produce evidence of causality of institutions on growth is to find an instrumental variable—a variable that is correlated with the independent variable (institutions) but not with the dependent variable (log GDP per capita)—and to perform instrumental variable regression. This method, explained more at length in the Econometric, allows us to estimate a causal effect from the independent variable to the dependent variable. In a first stage, the independent variable is regressed on the instrumental variable. This gives an estimate A Causal Effect of Institutions on Growth

Poverty and Inequality Another way to illustrate this relationship is to associate economic development with industrialization. Countries begin their economic development primarily with agricultural production. The industrial sector starts small but it is the source of economic growth and modernization. As the industrial sector grows, income inequality increases as incomes in the industrial sector are higher than those in the agricultural sector. When the industrial sector becomes dominant in the economy, income inequality begins to decrease. Thus, according to the Kuznets hypothesis, income inequality is a non-linear function of income with an inverted U-curve relationship between economic development and income inequality. Figure 6 illustrates the idea of the Kuznets curve with initial data from Kuznets’s research that was published in 1955. Figure 6 expresses income inequality as the share of the 20% richest over the 60% poorest in a population. Cross-sectional analysis. Since Kuznets, many researchers have asked whether the Kuznets curve is still relevant and extensive studies in the 1990s examined that question. Usually, a Kuznets curve could be based on cross- sectional studies of world income distribution data. In other words, a researcher would rank countries from the poorest to richest in terms of income on the horizontal axis, and then plot income inequality data on the vertical axis. Middle-income countries tend to have higher income inequality than lowor high-income countries. The middle-income countries are generally from GDP per capita Ratio of the income share of the 20% richest over the 60% poorest FIGURE 6 The Kuznets Curve Kuznets mapped GDP per capita on the horizontal axis and a measure of inequality for which data were available for a few countries: the ratio of the income share of the 20% richest over the 60% poorest. He found that inequality first increases with economic development and then decreases, forming an inverted U-curve.

Econometric Appendix If we do a regression for the second period, our OLS estimate r n 2 of r will be: r n 2 = E ( Y H D 2 = 1) E ( Y H D 2 = 0) = a + r + b E ( X H D 2 = 1) + E ( h H D 2 = 1) a b E ( X i H D 2 = 0) E ( h H D 2 = 0) = r + b E ( X H D 2 = 1) b E ( X H D 2 = 0) Taking the difference between estimates for both periods, we get: r n 2 r n 1 = r In other words, the difference-in-differences estimator gives us an estimate of the treatment effect. Why is this? Suppose there is a selection effect. This means that there will be a difference between b E ( X H D 2 = 1) and b E ( X H D 2 = 0). The estimate r n 2 for the second period will include both the estimate of the treatment effect and of the selection effect. However, the estimate of the effect before the treatment should pick up only selection effects. The difference between the two estimates (the estimate after the treatment minus the estimate before the treatment) should thus be equal to the treatment effect. Note that this will be true only if b E ( X H D 2 = 1) b E ( X H D i 2 = 0) is the same in period 1 and period 2. We thus see that even if a treatment has not been done randomly, it is sometimes possible to estimate the true treatment effect by exploiting the time dimension before and after the treatment. Instrumental Variables In many cases, causal inference can be very difficult because it is not possible to do randomized evaluations. One obvious reason is that we cannot redo experiments from the past. This is valid for all historical data. Another problem is that fixed effects estimates are only convincing if unobserved heterogeneity between treated and untreated does not vary over time and this is often not the case. Fortunately, there is another method to estimate causal effects in an unbiased way that is widely used: instrumental variables. We have cited many studies reporting instrumental variable estimates of causal effects. We first explain how it works and then provide the explanation for what it does. Assume the following regression model: Y = a + b X + h Assume that X and h are not uncorrelated (i.e., assume E ( h H X ) H 0). This violates the assumptions of the OLS model and will likely lead to biased estimates as seen above. This will be due either to a selection effect, omitted variables, or possibly even to reverse causality. We have already discussed the selection effect and the omitted variable problem; now we will consider reverse causality in more detail. If bad economic outcomes cause conflict, then conflict could also cause bad economic outcomes. Thus, if there is two-way causality, the OLS estimate will be biased. Indeed, if X measures economic prosperity and Y measures conflict,

Delivering Education in Developing Countries collected from 1,600 students (mainly in Bogota, the capital) 3 years later, after the start of high school. The lottery winners appeared to be 15% to 20% more likely to be in private schools and performed the equivalent of one grade higher on tests compared to lottery losers. The reasons for this stronger performance are twofold: First, the private schools were deemed to provide a better education. Second, students had an extra incentive to succeed in order to keep the voucher benefits. Indeed, students who failed a grade would lose the vouchers they had received from the experiment, so there was an extra incentive not to fail. The cost to the government of paying for one student’s voucher for private school for one year was only $24 higher than the cost of paying for that student’s education in the public system. The benefit, in terms of improved education, was deemed much larger. The evaluation of the Chilean experience by Hsieh and Urquiola led to more disappointing results. 15 Unlike the Colombian program, the Chilean voucher program was a nationwide initiative. In 1981, all Chilean students received vouchers that allowed them to attend the school of their choice. By 1990, 41% of students were in private schools compared to 22% in 1981. Similar to Colombia, there was a clear shift in Chile toward private schools. However, was the competition introduced by the voucher system effective in increasing incentives in public schools? The answer is no; the voucher system led to a decline in test scores, an increase in grade repetition rates, and a drop in the socioeconomic status of students in public schools. In other words, vouchers allowed the better public school students to transfer to private schools, thereby producing negative externalities on those students who stayed in the public school system. Did the improvements for those who went to private school compensate for the reduction in education outcomes in public schools? Hsieh and Urquiola found that this was not the case. The higher private school outcomes for those who benefited from the voucher system did not improve the average test outcomes of the schools in the same municipality. These results thus suggest that vouchers did not increase the average quality of education, but merely led to a sorting of students: the better students went to private schools, leaving the poorer students behind in the public schools. Reducing Education Costs Poor parents end up paying substantial amounts, relative to their income, for their children’s education, whether for textbooks, uniforms, or school supplies. Reducing the costs of schooling can thus help struggling parents. If education costs are cheaper, enrollment will be higher because many parents will decide to send their children to school instead of sending them to work. Different programs have been established to reduce the costs of schooling: conditional transfers, that is, payments to families that are contingent on parents sending their children to school; providing school meals to children; and supplying money for uniforms, textbooks, and classroom improvements. The effects of many of these programs have been evaluated by development economists. Conditional transfers. The Mexican government established a program called Progresa that provided cash grants to families, with the condition that they 15 Chang-Tai Hsieh and Miguel Urquiola, “The Effects of Generalized School Choice on Achievement and Stratification: Evidence from Chile’s Voucher Program,” Journal of Public Economics 90, no. 8-9 (2006): 1477-1503. 


Econometric Appendix The selection effect will be equal to zero if E ( h H D = 1) = E ( h H D = 0). This will be the case if the error term is uncorrelated with the independent variable, here the treatment variable. This is one of the basic assumptions of OLS as seen above (the relevant assumption being E ( e H X ) = 0). Therefore, in the presence of randomized evaluations, OLS will give us an unbiased estimator of the treatment effect. This will thus enable us to draw causal inferences about the relationship between the treatment variable or the independent variable and the dependent variable. If we now assume that there is more than one independent variable, then OLS will still give correct estimates as long as the dependent variables are not correlated with the error term and are drawn randomly. Now consider the following model: Y = a + r D + b X + h As long as X is not correlated with h , there is no problem. However, we must now add an additional assumption to be sure that OLS will give us an unbiased estimate: D should also not be correlated with X. Bias from Omitted Variables In many cases, the assumptions underlying the OLS model are violated. A first example is that of omitted variables. Suppose we want to estimate earnings Y as a function of the years of schooling S and run a regression based on the following model: Y = a + b S + e Suppose that the true relation is the following: Y = a + b S + g A + e , where A is the variable measuring a person’s ability, which differs across individuals. In this case, we have what is called omitted variable bias. This is a very frequent problem in econometric estimation because many variables are often not measured. For example, we do not have direct measures of individual ability. What is the problem with omitted variables? Supose we estimate the model of earnings as a function of schooling alone. The estimate of b will then be, following the formula developed above, cov( Y , S ) var( S ) . Now replace Y by its true model and develop the expression, using the properties of the expectations operator. This gives us: cov( a + b S + g A , S ) Var ( S ) = b var( S ) var( S ) + g cov( S , A ) var( S ) = b + g cov( S , A ) var( S ) 


Delivering Education in Developing Countries collected from 1,600 students (mainly in Bogota, the capital) 3 years later, after the start of high school. The lottery winners appeared to be 15% to 20% more likely to be in private schools and performed the equivalent of one grade higher on tests compared to lottery losers. The reasons for this stronger performance are twofold: First, the private schools were deemed to provide a better education. Second, students had an extra incentive to succeed in order to keep the voucher benefits. Indeed, students who failed a grade would lose the vouchers they had received from the experiment, so there was an extra incentive not to fail. The cost to the government of paying for one student’s voucher for private school for one year was only $24 higher than the cost of paying for that student’s education in the public system. The benefit, in terms of improved education, was deemed much larger. The evaluation of the Chilean experience by Hsieh and Urquiola led to more disappointing results. 15 Unlike the Colombian program, the Chilean voucher program was a nationwide initiative. In 1981, all Chilean students received vouchers that allowed them to attend the school of their choice. By 1990, 41% of students were in private schools compared to 22% in 1981. Similar to Colombia, there was a clear shift in Chile toward private schools. However, was the competition introduced by the voucher system effective in increasing incentives in public schools? The answer is no; the voucher system led to a decline in test scores, an increase in grade repetition rates, and a drop in the socioeconomic status of students in public schools. In other words, vouchers allowed the better public school students to transfer to private schools, thereby producing negative externalities on those students who stayed in the public school system. Did the improvements for those who went to private school compensate for the reduction in education outcomes in public schools? Hsieh and Urquiola found that this was not the case. The higher private school outcomes for those who benefited from the voucher system did not improve the average test outcomes of the schools in the same municipality. These results thus suggest that vouchers did not increase the average quality of education, but merely led to a sorting of students: the better students went to private schools, leaving the poorer students behind in the public schools.

Institutions and Economic Development car that is worth $ ,000. A buyer who is risk neutral , who values upside and downside payoffs equally and weighs them according to their probability, would not be ready to pay more than the expected value (( .5 * 12,000) + ( .5 * 4,000) = $ ,000) for a car. In other words, a risk-neutral agent looks at the expected payoff of a decision: the downside payoff ($ ,000) times its probability (. ) plus the upside payoff ($12,000) times its probability (. ). A riskaverse buyer, who puts less weight on the upside payoff than on the downside payoff for given probabilities, would pay even less or would possibly not even be ready to pay more than $ ,000 to buy the car. In this situation, the seller of a bad car would make a profit of $ ,000, but the seller of a good car would suffer a loss. Compared to a situation of perfect information, asymmetric information would tend to drive out the reputable sellers from the market and attract the disreputable sellers. If the honest sellers withdraw because they cannot make a profit, buyers will soon realize that only bad cars are available for which they are only willing to pay $ ,000, and the market will disappear. Adverse selection also occurs in the credit market. Suppose that there are two types of borrowers, good and bad. The good borrower is creditworthy and needs financing for a project that will earn a 10% return. The bad borrower does not intend to repay the loan at all. The bank must pay depositors an interest rate of 6%, otherwise they will withdraw their deposits and put their money elsewhere. Note that the return on the project for the good borrower (10%) is higher than the market return for depositors ( %). Assume that among the population of potential borrowers there is a 50% chance that a potential borrower is good and a 50% chance that he or she is bad. Without asymmetric information, the bank would not lend to the bad types and would lend only to the good types, making a profit because it could charge the borrowers up to 10% interest. Under asymmetric information, however, the bank cannot discriminate between good and bad borrowers and would have to charge the same interest rate to all borrowers. In order to pay back its depositors, the bank must charge an interest rate of at least 12% ( % divided by 50%, the probability that a loan is paid back). This interest rate will be too high for the good borrowers, who will decide not to apply for a loan, but the bad borrowers would not be discouraged by the high interest rate, because they do not intend to pay back the loan. Good borrowers are thus driven out of the market by the excessively high interest rate. Note that because of adverse selection, the price of credit, the interest rate, cannot serve as an efficient mechanism to adjust supply and demand in credit markets. If there is an excess demand for credit and if banks decide to adjust the interest rate upward to reduce that demand and attract more depositors, the effect is likely to be a decline in the quality of the credit pool, as some good borrowers whose projects have a somewhat lower profitability become discouraged by the higher interest rate while bad borrowers remain undeterred. The bank might reduce its profits by increasing interest rates because of the deterioration of the quality of the credit pool. For that reason, banks prefer not to increase the interest rate to market clearing rates and instead decide to ration credit ( credit rationing ). This means that only some applicants receive a loan and many other applicants are turned down. Obviously, banks try to gather as much information as they can on potential borrowers and use this information

Structural Change and Development Strategies The Harris-Todaro Model of Rural to Urban Migration While the capital accumulation predictions of the Lewis model were, for the most part, not verified, economists have seen confirmation of one of its predictions, the migration of workers from the traditional rural areas into urban areas. Unfortunately, because the modern sector does not usually develop as the Lewis model predicts, these rural migrants often join the large mass of urban unemployed or occasional workers in the informal sector. If this is the case, why does the work force continue moving away from rural areas only to land in urban shantytowns? One explanation to this puzzle can be found in the Harris-Todaro model of rural to urban migration. 7 As with the Lewis model, it is concerned with migration from rural to urban areas; however, in contrast to the Lewis model, which focuses on capital accumulation in the modern sector, Harris and Todaro focus on the puzzle of why people in rural areas may move to join the army of the urban poor and unemployed. We begin our discussion of the Harris-Todaro model by examining the rural to urban migration decision from the individual’s point of view. Imagine you are working in the countryside and are certain to live the impoverished life of your parents and grandparents, toiling hard on the land but barely able to feed your family. Your community has a weak basic infrastructure, with little or no water, electricity, gas, telephone, or television, and few public goods such as hospitals and schools. Going to the city might be tempting, but it is a risky proposition. You may be lucky, land a well-paying factory job, and be able to afford modest lodging with better amenities, a denser network of hospitals and schools, a television, and maybe even a car. If your children receive a good education, they may be able to improve their situations even further. On the other hand, you may join the mass of urban unemployed, living a life that may be even worse than what you left in the countryside. If the expected outcome that results from luck is high enough, then it might be worth taking the risk to migrate. The Harris-Todaro model formalizes this line of reasoning by analyzing workers’ migration decisions based on a comparison of lifetime-expected income in the rural areas versus that of urban areas. The Harris-Todaro Model and the Migration Equilibrium The Harris-Todaro model contains the following features: 1. The decision to migrate is based on a comparison between the expected lifetime income in a rural area and the expected lifetime income after migrating to an urban area. Once an individual migrates, it is assumed that he or she will not go back to the countryside. 8 7 John R. Harris and Michael P. Todaro. “Migration, Unemployment and Development: A Two-Sector Analysis, American Economic Review 60, no. 1 (1970): 126-142. 8 This will be the case in particular if the individual sells his or her land to finance the costs of migration. Note, however, that we assume away the cost of migration in the model to simplify the exposition.

Econometric Appendix and if the causality can go both ways, then Y will also cause X and because Y depends on h , then X will be correlated to h . The estimated coefficient of regression will therefore exaggerate the effect of the economy on conflict as it will pick up two-way causality. What do we do in all those cases where the independent variable and the error term are likely to be correlated? The instrumental variable method provides a solution. Take a variable Z such that the following relation holds: X = g + d Z + e As we can see from that equation, X is correlated with Z. We also assume that h and Z are uncorrelated, which means that Y and Z are also uncorrelated. We call the latter assumption the exclusion restriction. It says that there is no direct link between Y and Z, only an indirect link that works through the channel of X. A good instrumental variable must thus fulfill two conditions: it must be correlated with the independent variable but uncorrelated with the dependent variable. With the instrumental variable method, the estimated coefficient b IV for b in the bivariate regression case will be the following: b IV = s zy s zx This formula for the estimated coefficient for the instrumental variable method gives us a readily apprehended interpretation of the estimation technique. The coefficient is estimated by taking the ratio of the covariance of the instrumental variable with the dependent variable and the covariance of the instrumental variable with the independent variable. In other words, we look at the covariation between Z and Y relative to the covariation between Z and X. Let us think about instrumental variable estimation in the context of our example of the relationship between conflict and economic performance. Rainfall is a good instrument for economic performance. Rainfall affects crops in poor countries. On the other hand, we cannot argue that rainfall is directly correlated with conflict. Rainfall is thus a good instrument for economic performance. Intuitively, the instrumental variable regression will thus give an estimate of the effect of economic performance on conflict that is explained by the effect of rainfall on economic performance. Let us come back to the malaria vaccine example to elaborate further on instrumental variable regression. Assume that initially, we wanted to set up a randomized treatment to evaluate a malaria vaccine, but that the experiment was badly implemented and that only a portion of those individuals randomly selected for treatment took the vaccine. In this case, we would suspect that a selection effect is present. Let us call Z the intention to treat variable that takes a value of 0 or 1. Let us now call D(Z) the treatment value as a function of the value of Z. Thus, D( 0 ) is the treatment value if there was no intention to treat and D( 1 ), the treatment value if there is an intention to treat. Remember that D only takes the value of 0 or 1. Call Y the outcome variable. As before, we need to think of counterfactuals in order to estimate

Poverty and Inequality with little access to basic infrastructure and often lacking access even to safe drinking water and electricity. Economic Determinants of Inequality Why are there large differences in inequality across the world? What are the underlying economic forces that generate more inequality in some countries and less in others? We explore these questions in this section. Education and Income Inequality The first potential determinant of differences in income inequality across countries is variable access to education. Some countries have broad access to education while others do not. The idea of a link between education and income inequality is fairly straightforward: people with limited access to education will acquire less skills and consequently will earn lower wages than those with broader access. Countries that provide a solid education to their populations will have less income inequality because skills will be abundant and there will be fewer differences in wages. People with limited education are also less likely to participate in the political process than their educated peers. The illiterate are not able to read party platforms. If poor and uneducated people do not participate in the political process, there will be less pressure for income redistribution to the poor, which would reduce income inequality. Low education thus perpetuates educational and income inequality. Table 5 provides some broad data relative to income inequality and education (measured by literacy rates) that indicates some relation between the two, though perhaps not as strong as we might expect. Africa has high income inequality and also one of the lowest literacy rates while East Asia has a high Gini index (percentage) 90th/10th percentile ratio Sub-Saharan Africa 46 6.63 Middle East and North Africa 37 5.12 Latin America and Caribbean 50 14.42 South Asia 33 4.12 East Asia and Pacific 39 4.92 Eastern Europe and Central Asia 31 4.17 High-income OECD 31 4.09 Regional averages for the Gini coefficient and the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile of the population are shown here. Inequality is the highest in Latin America. Source : The World Bank, World Bank data base, http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/table _ .pdf.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development credit constraints and it means that, in the past, a firm wanted to invest, but was unable to do so because of credit constraints; only when profits increased could the firm finance some or all of its proposed investment by using retained earnings. This method of identifying credit constraints is based on the idea that there is, in general, no reason that investment should depend on past profits; rather, the desired investment of a firm should depend on its expectations of future profits. Therefore, if a firm is not credit constrained, its investment demand should not, in principle, be correlated to its past profits. This reasoning does not address the fact that profits can often be serially correlated ; that is, past, present, and future profits might be correlated. For example, assume that a firm works in a sector such as the production of cell phones where demand continues to expand. In the past, expanding demand has allowed the firm to make profits and it expects to increase those profits in the future. The firm would still make its investments on the basis of future expected profits. However, future expected profits are correlated with past profits because of demand expansion. An econometric analysis would thus find a positive correlation between investments and past profits. This correlation would not, however, necessarily be due to credit constraints, but rather to serial correlation of profits. Significant positive regression coefficients may thus significantly exaggerate the effect of credit constraints. There are other ways to measure credit constraints indirectly. Say that someone unexpectedly inherits money and subsequently makes an investment. This would be indicative of credit constraints because the inheritance acts as a substitute for credit. If there had not been any credit constraint, there would be no reason that an investment should be linked to an unexpected inheritance. Another example might be a firm that experiences a “cash flow shock,” a surprise inflow of cash as a result of many clients paying accounts receivable at the same time. In this case as well, if there is a correlation between positive cash flow shocks and investment, it would be indicative of credit constraints. However, the objection that profits can be serially correlated (i.e., correlated over time) may apply in this case, too. The surprise cash flow may be a signal of future profitability and lead the firm to invest. Here again, a correlation between cash flow shocks and investment may not be due only to credit constraints. Exploiting the Indian Priority Lending Reform For all the reasons just discussed, it is difficult to develop a reliable measure for the extent of credit constraints and researchers need a lot of ingenuity to come up with a convincing measure for them. One example is a study by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo that exploits a reform, implemented in 1998 in India, that was meant to improve access to subsidized credit. 8 Before 1998, India had a “priority lending” program in which banks, whether public or private, were 8 Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, “Do Firms Want to Borrow More? Testing Credit Constraints Using a Directed Lending Program” (working paper, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 2004). 


Poverty and Inequality with little access to basic infrastructure and often lacking access even to safe drinking water and electricity. Economic Determinants of Inequality Why are there large differences in inequality across the world? What are the underlying economic forces that generate more inequality in some countries and less in others? We explore these questions in this section. Education and Income Inequality The first potential determinant of differences in income inequality across countries is variable access to education. Some countries have broad access to education while others do not. The idea of a link between education and income inequality is fairly straightforward: people with limited access to education will acquire less skills and consequently will earn lower wages than those with broader access. Countries that provide a solid education to their populations will have less income inequality because skills will be abundant and there will be fewer differences in wages. People with limited education are also less likely to participate in the political process than their educated peers. The illiterate are not able to read party platforms. If poor and uneducated people do not participate in the political process, there will be less pressure for income redistribution to the poor, which would reduce income inequality. Low education thus perpetuates educational and income inequality. Table 5 provides some broad data relative to income inequality and education (measured by literacy rates) that indicates some relation between the two, though perhaps not as strong as we might expect. Africa has high income inequality and also one of the lowest literacy rates while East Asia has a high Gini index (percentage) 90th/10th percentile ratio Sub-Saharan Africa 46 6.63 Middle East and North Africa 37 5.12 Latin America and Caribbean 50 14.42 South Asia 33 4.12 East Asia and Pacific 39 4.92 Eastern Europe and Central Asia 31 4.17 High-income OECD 31 4.09 Regional averages for the Gini coefficient and the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile of the population are shown here. Inequality is the highest in Latin America. Source : The World Bank, World Bank data base, http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/table _ .pdf.

Institutions and Economic Development Efficient institutional solutions provide critical reductions in transaction costs and contribute to economic development. Informational Problems A simple transaction often involves informational problems, as one party is bound to have more information about a product’s quality than the other party does, a situation that economists call asymmetric information . For example, food distributors may ship food products that were not stored under proper conditions, a used car salesman might sell cars with hidden mechanical problems, a software company may sell an operating system that has programming flaws, or a real estate agent may sell a house that has hidden structural defects. In most cases, the buyer may not have the information necessary to decide whether or not to purchase an item and/or it might be very costly or outright impossible to acquire all the relevant information prior to making a purchase. These informational problems are present in all economies, both developed and less developed. Lack of information about a product and a possible lack of trust in the seller may prevent the buyer from completing the transaction. Because of asymmetric information, many transactions, even legitimate ones, might not take place at all. Asymmetric information is also detrimental to transactions that do not involve the exchange of goods. This is the case for credit contracts, where there is usually an informational asymmetry between the lender and the borrower. The lender does not know the creditworthiness of the borrower, his or her willingness or ability to fulfill a debt contract. Because of asymmetric information, a creditor may refrain from lending even to a very creditworthy individual. Entrepreneurs who have good ideas for the productive use of capital may not be able to realize those ideas because they might be unable to obtain loans to start their businesses. This is a very serious problem in developing economies. Adverse selection. Informational problems may lead to adverse selection , a situation caused by informational asymmetries in which reputable lenders and sellers leave the market to disreputable players, resulting in a possible market collapse. George Akerlof received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his article “The Market for Lemons,” in which he showed how informational asymmetries and adverse selection can cause the disappearance of markets or even severe market failure. 2 He described second-hand car markets in which the seller has information about the quality of the car but the buyer does not. Assume that there are good second-hand cars that cost the seller $10,000 (purchase plus repairs) and are worth $12,000 to consumers. Also assume that there are bad second-hand cars that cost the seller $ ,000 but are worth only $ ,000 to the buyer. If there are no informational asymmetries, good cars would sell and deliver a profit of $ ,000 to the seller and bad cars would not sell because they would deliver a loss of $ ,000. Assume now that there is informational asymmetry and that 50% of the cars are good and 50% are bad. A buyer now faces a 50% chance of buying a car that is worth $12,000 and a 50% chance of buying a 2 George A.

Institutions and Economic Development fundamental part of culture and encompasses most of the beliefs, values, and social norms in many societies. Interactions between Institutions There are complex interactions between formal and informal institutions. First, laws often evolve with culture and social norms. The death penalty, for example, was a popular method of punishment until many countries did away with it as a result of rising popular opposition. Second, it is very difficult to impose formal laws or formal institutions that are not in accordance with existing social norms; conflict between formal institutions and social norms can create conflict in developing countries. For example, international borders established in Africa after decolonization did not correspond to existing ethnic subdivisions. Tribes were separated across formal borders, but (informal) tribal and ethnic loyalties took precedence over (formal) national loyalties. As a result, politics polarized along ethnic lines, resulting in violence. Legal systems inherited from former colonial powers conflicted with social norms associated with tribalism. Even though there were formal rules prohibiting nepotism, politicians favored their families and friends because this favoritism was seen as the fulfillment of long-established moral obligations to fellow tribe members. Similarly, in a country where social norms are based on religion, it is very difficult to impose laws that appear to violate religious obligations, prohibitions, or constraints. A case in point is the prohibition of the Islamic veil in schools and public places in certain countries, which is seen by practicing Muslims as violating their religious norms. Third, formal institutions often strengthen the effects of informal institutions. The social norm of honesty is supported by a legal system punishing a dishonest trader and makes that norm easier to enforce throughout the society. Similarly, informal institutions often complement and reinforce formal institutions; legal codes may be incomplete and social norms can help to supplement them and make them more effective. In some legal systems, citizens are obligated by law to help someone who has had an accident or whose life is in jeopardy. Even when the law does not specify in detail when this legal obligation applies, social norms provide the moral obligation to help a person in danger. Formal and informal institutions tend to be complementary and to have increased effectiveness in a society or culture when they are based on the same fundamental set of beliefs. If they are in conflict, formal institutions do not work as well as established social norms. What Do Institutions Do? As we discuss the economic role of institutions, we will examine five important problems that occur in basic economic transactions and show how institutions can help to solve these problems: informational problems, hold-up problems, commitment problems, cooperation problems, and coordination problems. The solutions to these problems have significant economic effects on the development of commerce, entrepreneurship, trade, innovation, and investment.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development Second, progressive lending eliminates informational asymmetries because borrowers and lenders develop long-term relationships. When a lender knows little or nothing about a borrower, the lender is less willing to risk providing the borrower with higher loan amounts. However, as the lender accumulates more information about the borrower’s competence and reliability, the lender is more willing to provide funds to the borrower. Progressive lending also reduces risk. A default on a smaller loan is less risky than a default on a larger loan. As the lender acquires more information about the borrower, the lender may (or may not) be willing to take more risk. Progressive lending’s incentive properties are, however, independent from the properties of group lending. A borrower can have an individual loan, without joint liability features, that includes progressive lending. But because progressive lending only works when there is a long-term relationship between the borrower and the lender, problems can arise. What if there is competition between lenders with one lender willing to lend more upfront today than the Algebra helps us to understand the logic of how group lending leads borrowers to self-sort into different risk groups. Assume two types of projects, one risky and the other safe. The safe project has a probability of success p s , in which case there is a return R s . In case of failure, the return is zero. The risky project has a probability of success p r that is smaller than p s ( p r 6 p s ), but the return R r is higher than R s ( R r 7 R s ). For simplicity, we assume that the expected return is the same in both cases: p s R s = p r R r . Agent A, with a safe project, teaming with agent B, also with a safe project, would have an expected return of p s [ R s r (1 p s ) c ], where r is the interest rate and c is the joint liability payment that would have to be paid to the bank if B’s project fails. Note that A will pay c only in case he or she is successful and B is unsuccessful. If both are unsuccessful, they cannot pay back c. Now, if agent A would team with agent C who has a risky project, A would have an expected return of p s [ R s r (1 p r ) c ]. When we calculate the difference between both expressions, we find that the gain for A of teaming with a borrower with a safe project rather than with a borrower with a risky project is p s ( p s p r ) c . This expression is positive because p s 7 p r . Let us now look at the gain for agent C with a risky project of teaming with a borrower with a safe project. Using the same logic as above, we find that this return is equal to p r [ R r r (1 p s ) c ]. Similarly, the return to C from teaming with agent D’s risky project is p r [ R r r (1 p r ) c ]. The gain from teaming with the safe project (the difference between the two expressions) is thus p r ( p s p r ) c . This expression is also positive. Note, however, that p r ( p s p r ) c 6 p s ( p s p r ) c , because p r 6 p s . In other words, the gain for agent C with a risky project to team with agent A with a safe project rather than with agent D with a risky project is smaller than the loss agent A would incur by teaming with agent C rather than with agent B. Because p r ( p s p r ) c is the maximum agent C would be prepared to pay agent A to team together rather than to team with agent B, and because that sum is lower than p s ( p s p r ) c , which represents the sum that would be necessary to convince agent A to do so, the deal would not go through as the net gains are negative. Sorting by risk types is thus efficient because none of the agents can use gains from trade to convince the others to change their decisions. Group Lending and Sorting 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development subsidizing microcredit associations because the money loaned generates income and wealth that might not otherwise be the result of more traditional poverty alleviation programs. This is, of course, only an argument. Serious research is needed to measure the costs and benefits of using microcredit as a tool for poverty alleviation compared to other instruments. Evaluating Microfinance Despite microcredit’s significant success in providing loans to the poor, few studies have tried to evaluate its effects on economic development systematically. However, Ahbijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, Rachel Glennerster, and Cynthia Kinnan have put together one of the first randomized trials to evaluate the effects of microcredit. 10 In 2005, some 52 of the 104 neighborhoods in Hyderabad (India’s fifth largest city and the capital of the state of Andhra Pradesh) were randomly selected as locations for branches of the Spandana Company, one of the fastest growing microfinance institutions in Andhra Pradesh. Microcredit would then be available to households in these “treated” areas but not to those in the other 52 neighborhoods in the “control” areas. Similar to the Grameen Bank, Spandana provides group loans. A group includes 6-10 self-selected women who are jointly responsible for all loans made to the group’s members. The size of a first loan is the equivalent of $ ,000 at purchasing parity exchange rates. Loan duration is 50 weeks with a 24% annual percentage rate (APR). If all loans within a group are reimbursed, group members are eligible for a second loan of a somewhat larger size. Only women aged 18-59 are eligible, provided they have resided in the same neighborhood for at least 1 year and have valid identification and proof of residence. At least 80% of the women in a group must own their homes. Fifteen to 18 months after the branches opened, the research team conducted a survey in about 6,850 households in all 104 neighborhoods (an average of 66 per neighborhood). Among households surveyed, 27% in the 52 treated neighborhoods had a loan from a microfinance institution against 18. % in the 52 control neighborhoods. This confirms that microfinance leads to more borrowing by households. One out of five of these additional loans in the treated neighborhoods led to the creation of a new business. While households in the treated neighborhoods did not display higher household spending than in those in the control neighborhoods, they did spend more on durable goods (bicycles, cell phones, watches, televisions) and less on “temptation goods” such as cigarettes, alcohol, or gambling. This suggests that microcredit encourages households to be more disciplined and to invest more in durable goods that can be useful when starting a business. According to the study, microcredit did not change the bargaining power within households; women in treated neighborhoods were no more likely to be the primary decision makers for household expenditures, financial choices, or children’s education than those in the control neighborhoods.

Poverty and Inequality the latest data he used in his study. We see that there was an upward trend until the 1980s, but that there has been a continuous downward trend since then. How can we explain this downward trend? The answer has to do mainly with the process of economic growth in China and India. As these countries are so important in terms of the world population, their income growth has pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and reduced income inequality worldwide. The economic reform process started in China in 1978 and it is exactly around that time that the world Gini coefficient began to drop. Figure 9 illustrates the evolution of the Gini coefficient by excluding some countries or continents to gauge the effect of the growth of different countries. Note that in the figure, the vertical axis is scaled down so that the evolution of world income inequality looks flatter than in Figure 8. Nevertheless, we do see the same downward trend. For example, when we exclude China, we see that the world Gini has tended to increase from .62 to .648. The growth process in China has thus played a crucial role in reducing income inequality worldwide. China represents more than one-fifth of the world population, so what happens there has an important effect on the world economy. The growth of China is not the only factor that has influenced the evolution of the world distribution of income. If we exclude the United States, then the decrease in income inequality is even greater. This is not suprising because income inequality in the United States has increased significantly in recent decades. If we exclude Africa, which has become poorer during that time period, the decrease in inequality is also greater. If we exclude Africa, China, FIGURE 9 Evolution of the World Gini Coefficient (1970-2000), Excluding Various Countries 0.58 0.59 0.60 0.61 0.62 0.63 0.64 0.65 0.66 0.67 All Countries NO China NO USA NO Africa NO Africa and China and USA Excluding China, income inequality worldwide has increased over time. Excluding Africa, China, and the United States, it has remained stable. Source: Sala-i-Martin, “The World Distribution of Income,” 387.

If all loans within a group are reimbursed, group members are eligible for a second loan of a somewhat larger size. Only women aged 18-59 are eligible, provided they have resided in the same neighborhood for at least 1 year and have valid identification and proof of residence. At least 80% of the women in a group must own their homes. Fifteen to 18 months after the branches opened, the research team conducted a survey in about 6,850 households in all 104 neighborhoods (an average of 66 per neighborhood). Among households surveyed, 27% in the 52 treated neighborhoods had a loan from a microfinance institution against 18. % in the 52 control neighborhoods. This confirms that microfinance leads to more borrowing by households. One out of five of these additional loans in the treated neighborhoods led to the creation of a new business. While households in the treated neighborhoods did not display higher household spending than in those in the control neighborhoods, they did spend more on durable goods (bicycles, cell phones, watches, televisions) and less on “temptation goods” such as cigarettes, alcohol, or gambling. This suggests that microcredit encourages households to be more disciplined and to invest more in durable goods that can be useful when starting a business. According to the study, microcredit did not change the bargaining power within households; women in treated neighborhoods were no more likely to be the primary decision makers for household expenditures, financial choices, or children’s education than those in the control neighborhoods.

Poverty and Inequality the latest data he used in his study. We see that there was an upward trend until the 1980s, but that there has been a continuous downward trend since then. How can we explain this downward trend? The answer has to do mainly with the process of economic growth in China and India. As these countries are so important in terms of the world population, their income growth has pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and reduced income inequality worldwide. The economic reform process started in China in 1978 and it is exactly around that time that the world Gini coefficient began to drop. Figure 9 illustrates the evolution of the Gini coefficient by excluding some countries or continents to gauge the effect of the growth of different countries. Note that in the figure, the vertical axis is scaled down so that the evolution of world income inequality looks flatter than in Figure 8. Nevertheless, we do see the same downward trend. For example, when we exclude China, we see that the world Gini has tended to increase from .62 to .648. The growth process in China has thus played a crucial role in reducing income inequality worldwide. China represents more than one-fifth of the world population, so what happens there has an important effect on the world economy. The growth of China is not the only factor that has influenced the evolution of the world distribution of income. If we exclude the United States, then the decrease in income inequality is even greater. This is not suprising because income inequality in the United States has increased significantly in recent decades. If we exclude Africa, which has become poorer during that time period, the decrease in inequality is also greater. If we exclude Africa, China, FIGURE 9 Evolution of the World Gini Coefficient (1970-2000), Excluding Various Countries 0.58 0.59 0.60 0.61 0.62 0.63 0.64 0.65 0.66 0.67 All Countries NO China NO USA NO Africa NO Africa and China and USA Excluding China, income inequality worldwide has increased over time.

Corruption estimate of the kickbacks from oil buyers who would pay a lower official price, but give kickbacks to the Iraqi government in the amount of the difference between the market price and the official price. The researchers estimated that $ -$4 billion in bribes were collected by the Iraqi government, which is between 2% and 10% of total spending under the auspices of the Oil for Food program. These microeconomic measures of corruption are very useful, but they are relatively scarce and only measure certain aspects of corruption without allowing for international comparisons of corruption that are very useful. John McMillan and Pablo Zoido have studied the records kept by Vladimiro Montesinos, the head of Peru’s secret police under President Alberto Fujimori, that document the bribes paid by the Fujimori government to politicians, judges, and the media. 7 The amount of bribes paid to various agents is indicative of an indirect reflection of checks and balances on the executive in the sense that those who need to be bribed the most are those who have more powers to check actions of the executive branch of government. Among politicians, the largest bribes went to opposition leaders of the Peruvian Congress who were bribed to join Fujimori’s party. They received higher bribes than those recipients from Fujimori’s party. To demonstrate the value of muzzling the opposition, McMillan and Zoido found that the costs of bribes to politicians to obtain a majority of votes in the Congress were about $300,000 per month. Among judges, those on the national election board received the largest bribes, but on average, bribes to judges were somewhat lower than those to politicians; the total bribes paid to judges were about $250,000 per month. By far the largest bribes went to the news media. Two newspaper directors received payments between 1 and 1.5 million dollars over 2 7 John McMillan and Pablo Zoido, “How to Subvert Democracy: Montesinos in Peru,” The Journal of Economic Perspectives 18, no. 4 (2004): 69-92. years. However, the most costly bribes went to television channels, in the amount of $3 million per month, an amount far greater than that paid to politicians and judges. Why did television broadcasters receive the biggest bribes? One possible explanation is that they were richer to begin with and needed more money to be silenced. However, they were carrying significant debt and could, theoretically, have been bought off more easily. Another, potentially more convincing, reason is that television is a powerful tool for exposing the abuses of incumbent politicians and mobilizing the citizenry against them. In other words, it is a key instrument to overcome the collective-action problem of citizens in fighting a corrupt regime. Mobilized citizens are the ultimate check against dishonest politicians and this underscores the importance of free media as a vital institution in a healthy democracy. Another, more subtle, explanation might be that TV broadcasters had more bargaining power in extracting bribes than did judges or politicians. All the country’s TV channels had to be bribed in order not to expose the corruption and abuse, but not all politicians needed to be bribed to achieve a majority in congress. As a result, each TV channel had significant bargaining power that allowed it to extract huge bribes. Who Received the Biggest Bribes from Peru’s Fujimori Government? 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development Second, progressive lending eliminates informational asymmetries because borrowers and lenders develop long-term relationships. When a lender knows little or nothing about a borrower, the lender is less willing to risk providing the borrower with higher loan amounts. However, as the lender accumulates more information about the borrower’s competence and reliability, the lender is more willing to provide funds to the borrower. Progressive lending also reduces risk. A default on a smaller loan is less risky than a default on a larger loan. As the lender acquires more information about the borrower, the lender may (or may not) be willing to take more risk. Progressive lending’s incentive properties are, however, independent from the properties of group lending. A borrower can have an individual loan, without joint liability features, that includes progressive lending. But because progressive lending only works when there is a long-term relationship between the borrower and the lender, problems can arise. What if there is competition between lenders with one lender willing to lend more upfront today than the Algebra helps us to understand the logic of how group lending leads borrowers to self-sort into different risk groups. Assume two types of projects, one risky and the other safe. The safe project has a probability of success p s , in which case there is a return R s . In case of failure, the return is zero. The risky project has a probability of success p r that is smaller than p s ( p r 6 p s ), but the return R r is higher than R s ( R r 7 R s ). For simplicity, we assume that the expected return is the same in both cases: p s R s = p r R r . Agent A, with a safe project, teaming with agent B, also with a safe project, would have an expected return of p s [ R s r (1 p s ) c ], where r is the interest rate and c is the joint liability payment that would have to be paid to the bank if B’s project fails. Note that A will pay c only in case he or she is successful and B is unsuccessful. If both are unsuccessful, they cannot pay back c. Now, if agent A would team with agent C who has a risky project, A would have an expected return of p s [ R s r (1 p r ) c ]. When we calculate the difference between both expressions, we find that the gain for A of teaming with a borrower with a safe project rather than with a borrower with a risky project is p s ( p s p r ) c . This expression is positive because p s 7 p r . Let us now look at the gain for agent C with a risky project of teaming with a borrower with a safe project. Using the same logic as above, we find that this return is equal to p r [ R r r (1 p s ) c ]. Similarly, the return to C from teaming with agent D’s risky project is p r [ R r r (1 p r ) c ]. The gain from teaming with the safe project (the difference between the two expressions) is thus p r ( p s p r ) c . This expression is also positive. Note, however, that p r ( p s p r ) c 6 p s ( p s p r ) c , because p r 6 p s . In other words, the gain for agent C with a risky project to team with agent A with a safe project rather than with agent D with a risky project is smaller than the loss agent A would incur by teaming with agent C rather than with agent B. Because p r ( p s p r ) c is the maximum agent C would be prepared to pay agent A to team together rather than to team with agent B, and because that sum is lower than p s ( p s p r ) c , which represents the sum that would be necessary to convince agent A to do so, the deal would not go through as the net gains are negative. Sorting by risk types is thus efficient because none of the agents can use gains from trade to convince the others to change their decisions. Group Lending and Sorting

Delivering Education in Developing Countries are thus better off as a result of the legal ban on child labor that leads to higher wages. If parents individually withdraw their children from the labor market in order to give them an education, there will be no effect on adult wages; there is only an effect if all parents do it at the same time. The collective-action problem of parents can only be overcome through an institutional constraint that bans child labor. Historical experience shows that child labor has disappeared only when it has been banned. In addition to a possible ethical argument against child labor, there is thus also an economic argument. As a result, a ban on child labor can benefit not only the children, but also their parents. Indeed, it can improve the welfare of all generations and of society at large. This argument is not as simple as it may seem. Banning child labor without making sure that children receive an education might have negative effects. Parents may send their children to work in the underground economy or the children may even end up in human trafficking rings once child labor is illegal. Moreover, banning child labor itself might not be the best policy for social welfare. Very poor families may find themselves in dire straits if their children cannot work and the parents cannot afford to pay for their education. Education subsidies and government-sponsored loans to parents might be necessary complements to a ban on child labor to ensure that poor parents can send their children to school. In countries rife with corruption, unscrupulous officials and politicians often divert government funds from their intended use. This diversion is very difficult to measure because it is the result of clandestine activities. A very interesting study by Ritva Reinikka and Jakob Svensson of Ugandan schools was able to measure the diversion of funds intended for school grants. 5 These are called capitation grants, that is, grants proportional to the number of students in a school. These grants are earmarked for nonwage expenditures because teacher salaries are paid directly by the central government, and they were supposed to be managed by the local districts on behalf of the central government. In the framework of a survey by the World Bank, schools were asked how much funding they actually received from the capitation grants. This amount was then compared to the theoretical capitation grant, that is, the official per-student grant multiplied by the number of students. The results were quite striking. The study done in 1995 found that only 23. % of the entitled capitation grants reached the schools, a diversion rate of 76. %! More than half of the schools surveyed did not receive any money at all (a median share of entitled grants of 0%). The story does not end there, however. The results of the research were so shocking that the information on the diversion was reported in the Ugandan media. The government decided to publish information on the monthly transfers of capitation grants in order to create transparency and keep the public informed. The changes that were a result of this decision were quite drastic, as can be seen in Table 8. By 2001, nearly 82% of the capitation grants were effectively transferred to the schools. Why did the number not jump 5 Ritva Reinikka and Jakob Svensson, “Local Capture: Evidence from a Central Government Transfer Program in Uganda,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 119, no. 2 (2004): 679-705.

Corruption To summarize, countries that have been developed for a long time and have an established history of democracy have less corruption. Independent and vigorous media are an important anticorruption factor. Natural resources tend to engender more corruption, while openness to trade is associated with less corruption. As we can see, corruption is primarily determined by longterm factors that correlate with economic prosperity and democracy. Culture and Corruption Because the long term seems to matter for corruption and because culture changes very slowly over time corruption might be closely related to culture and to people’s beliefs and value systems. We now examine the links between culture and corruption. Different Cultures, Their Various Social Norms, and Corruption We usually associate corruption with acts that are “morally wrong.” However, this need not always be the case. Think of stories about German businessmen who hid Jews in their factories during World War II and bribed Nazi authorities to look the other way. These were acts of corruption, but undoubtedly they represented high moral values that were praiseworthy. Similarly, in today’s world, no one would fault bribing a North Korean border guard to help a political opponent of the regime escape its oppression. In any country ruled by a dictatorship, examples like these would not be unusual. If an act is seen as morally correct, then there is no social opprobrium associated with it. As a result, society may accept or even encourage such acts. However, what is considered morally correct or reprehensible can vary across countries. In many countries around the New Year, municipal sanitation workers or firefighters come to people’s homes to collect annual tips. This is usually not seen as a form of corruption but it is not easy to argue otherwise. People may for example feel they must give the municipal sanitation workers a tip because otherwise they might find part of their garbage spilled on the ground. Now consider the case of people who stand in line to get a passport or another official document and then tip the employee who assists them. We would certainly consider it corruption because it is something that is not usually done. But how different is it from tipping municipal sanitation workers? It is conceivable that in some countries, the social norm dictates that municipal clerks must receive tips. Social norms on tipping vary greatly across countries. In the Unites States, tipping a waiter is not only morally acceptable, it is a social obligation. In most other advanced industrial countries, tipping in restaurants is not a social norm; for example, Europeans feel uncomfortable having to pay tips in American restaurants. 21 Of course, we can argue endlessly about different cases 21 Another perspective on bribing is the frequent flyer miles individuals earn each time they fly for their companies. It is well understood that this creates an incentive for loyalty to an airline company that can then charge its passengers higher prices.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development credit constraints and it means that, in the past, a firm wanted to invest, but was unable to do so because of credit constraints; only when profits increased could the firm finance some or all of its proposed investment by using retained earnings. This method of identifying credit constraints is based on the idea that there is, in general, no reason that investment should depend on past profits; rather, the desired investment of a firm should depend on its expectations of future profits. Therefore, if a firm is not credit constrained, its investment demand should not, in principle, be correlated to its past profits. This reasoning does not address the fact that profits can often be serially correlated ; that is, past, present, and future profits might be correlated. For example, assume that a firm works in a sector such as the production of cell phones where demand continues to expand. In the past, expanding demand has allowed the firm to make profits and it expects to increase those profits in the future. The firm would still make its investments on the basis of future expected profits. However, future expected profits are correlated with past profits because of demand expansion. An econometric analysis would thus find a positive correlation between investments and past profits. This correlation would not, however, necessarily be due to credit constraints, but rather to serial correlation of profits. Significant positive regression coefficients may thus significantly exaggerate the effect of credit constraints. There are other ways to measure credit constraints indirectly. Say that someone unexpectedly inherits money and subsequently makes an investment. This would be indicative of credit constraints because the inheritance acts as a substitute for credit. If there had not been any credit constraint, there would be no reason that an investment should be linked to an unexpected inheritance. Another example might be a firm that experiences a “cash flow shock,” a surprise inflow of cash as a result of many clients paying accounts receivable at the same time. In this case as well, if there is a correlation between positive cash flow shocks and investment, it would be indicative of credit constraints. However, the objection that profits can be serially correlated (i.e., correlated over time) may apply in this case, too. The surprise cash flow may be a signal of future profitability and lead the firm to invest. Here again, a correlation between cash flow shocks and investment may not be due only to credit constraints. Exploiting the Indian Priority Lending Reform For all the reasons just discussed, it is difficult to develop a reliable measure for the extent of credit constraints and researchers need a lot of ingenuity to come up with a convincing measure for them. One example is a study by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo that exploits a reform, implemented in 1998 in India, that was meant to improve access to subsidized credit. 8 Before 1998, India had a “priority lending” program in which banks, whether public or private, were 8 Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, “Do Firms Want to Borrow More? Testing Credit Constraints Using a Directed Lending Program” (working paper, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 2004). 


Poverty and Inequality Latin America, which is a notoriously inegalitarian region. The equation for performing the analysis with a cross-sectional regression is as follows: Inequality i = a + by i + cy i 2 + error i where y i is income per capita. There is a Kuznets curve or an inverted U-curve between income per capita and income inequality if coefficient b is significant and positive, and coefficient c is both significant and negative. Cross-sectional analysis assumes that all countries go through the same economic development process and that income per capita is the only variable determining income inequality. These assumptions warrant questioning. As Asian countries develop economically to reach the income levels of Latin America, why should they have the income inequality levels of Latin America? Similarly, can we expect that as Latin American countries develop to reach the income levels of Europe those levels will become as equal as Europe’s? There are many country-specific determinants of income inequality, so comparing countries is like comparing apples and oranges. This is a general problem of cross-sectional regressions. Panel regression. It is important to distinguish between the cross-sectional data and the time series evolution. If the same country, say Brazil, goes through an inverted U-curve of inequality as it develops, this trend would be more convincing evidence for the Kuznets curve than would a comparison of income inequality in Mali (a low-income country), Brazil (a middle-income country), and Germany (a high-income country). A panel regression , a regression technique that analyzes data variation across countries and across time, is the most widely used method to make this comparison. A panel regression analyzing the effect of income per capita on income inequality will have the following form: Inequality it = a i + b i y it + c i y it 2 + error it Note that we now have two indices: i for country and t for time. We also have country-specific coefficients a i , b i , and c i . In particular, b i and c i will be the country-specific coefficients for the Kuznets curve. If these coefficients are significant and have the expected signs ( b i positive and c i negative), then we can be sure that as the same country develops, inequality goes through an inverted U-curve. A study by Klaus Deininger and Lyn Squire found no evidence of an inverted U-curve based on such a panel regression. 11 However, the time span of their data was relatively short, as available data for most countries only go back to 1970 or 1980. In a more recent study, Robert J. Barro found some evidence of a Kuznets curve, but it explained only a small part of the variation in income inequality. 12 11 Klaus Deininger and Lyn Squire, “A New Data Set Measuring Income Inequality,” World Bank Economic Review 10, no. 3 (1996): 565-591. 12 Robert J.

Corruption The correlation between level of development and corruption is very strong and it is still present and quite significant when we control for other variables that could affect corruption, such as ethno-linguistic fractionalization and geographical variables such as latitude, region, religion, culture, democracy, trade openness, inequality, inflation, and government policies. Political Institutions and Corruption Not surprisingly, there is a relationship between political institutions and corruption. This is a topic that has been the subject of a large body of research. A first-order effect is that of democracy and political rights on perceived corruption. Countries with democratic institutions tend to be less corrupt. However, the relationship is not mechanical: an improvement or deterioration of the Freedom House democracy index or the polity score does not necessarily lead to an automatic deterioration or improvement in the corruption score. Here again, the long term seems to matter a lot. Treisman’s 2007 study, cited above, found that the duration of a democracy impacts its level of corruption: countries that have been democracies since 1950 are less likely to be corrupt. He also found that freedom of the press has significant impact on corruption levels, a result that echoes the large bribes Peru’s Fujimori administration paid to the directors of Peru’s TV channels. A greater circulation of daily newspapers also has a negative effect on perceived corruption. An important distinction among democratic regimes is found between presidential and parliamentary systems. Studies by Ugo Panizza and by Jana Kunicova and Susan Rose-Ackerman have found that, controlling for income, democracies with a directly elected president tend to be more corrupt than parliamentary democracies. 14 They reason that most existing presidential regimes are characterized by a president with a high degree of executive power. In contrast, power is more diluted in a parliamentary government. However, in terms of the effect of a powerful presidential regime on corruption, the studies primarily focus on the fact that Latin American regimes, which are all presidential, have higher corruption scores. The effect of presidential regimes on corruption ceases to be significant if a “Latin America” dummy variable (taking a value of 1 if the country is in Latin America and 0 otherwise) is included, or if a Catholicism variable (percentage of Catholics in a country) is included because it is the predominant religion in Latin America. 15 It is thus difficult to tell whether the presidential regime actually causes more corruption or whether corruption in this region has something to do with elements of Catholic culture or with other variables that are specific to Latin American societies. Another important distinction among democratic regimes is the effect of electoral rules. Scholars have argued that corruption should be lower in 14 Ugo Panizza, “Electoral Rules, Political Systems, and Institutional Quality,” Economics and Politics 13, no. 3 (2001): 311-342; and Jana Kunicova and Susan Rose-Ackerman, “Electoral Rules and Constitutional Structures as Constraints on Corruption,” British Journal of Political Science 35, no. 4 (2005): 573-606. 15 Dummy variables are variables that can take only two values: 1 or 0.

Institutions and Economic Development to decide to whom they allocate credit. While this information search helps to alleviate informational asymmetries, it is usually only a partial solution to the problem: many creditworthy borrowers are still denied loans while untrustworthy borrowers are approved for credit. Moral hazard. Another problem that arises from asymmetric information is moral hazard , the possibility of unobservable actions one of the contracting parties can take that will hurt the interest of the other contracting party. A typical example of moral hazard arises in the relationship between a landlord and a wage laboring farmer. If the landlord pays the farmer an hourly wage to work the land, the farmer may not work as hard as he would if the land were his own because the landlord cannot observe how hard he works and he receives the same wage whether he works hard or not. The difference between moral hazard and adverse selection is not always clear. Moral hazard involves asymmetric information as well as unobservable actions. Adverse selection involves only asymmetric information. Take the example of the automobile insurance market. Assume a situation in which there are good and bad drivers, but all drivers do their best to avoid accidents. This is a case of adverse selection. Drivers differ only in their abilities and insurance companies cannot, without prior investigation, distinguish between good and bad drivers when offering an insurance contract. Now assume a situation in which all drivers are equally good but they may decide to drive less carefully because they know they are insured. This is a case of moral hazard in which the action taken is how carefully to drive. In the case of a credit relationship, the difference between adverse selection and moral hazard is blurred. Adverse selection occurs if the quality of the loan is independent of actions taken by the borrower, as is the case if the borrower is intrinsically dishonest or incompetent. On the other hand, there is a moral hazard problem when the quality of the loan depends on the actions of the borrower. The borrower can deliberately choose a riskier project or fail to take the necessary actions to make the project profitable. In reality, a combination of both moral hazard and adverse selection exists, but it is important to keep in mind the conceptual difference between them. Institutional solutions to informational problems. The obligation by one or more parties to a transaction to disclose information relevant to the transaction is referred to as disclosure rules , legal solutions to informational problems such as in the case of the sale of a house or a company that is listed publicly. The seller of a house must, for example, disclose information on past repairs or damages to the house. Executives of a company listed for sale must reveal information about their business dealings and about their governance. In many professions, there is regulation of access or entry , rules that govern entry into and the practice of a profession, and require a candidate to earn a qualified diploma or pass an exam as a means to screen out unqualified people. This is the case for doctors; without rules for entering the medical profession, consumers would have no formal way to distinguish between qualified and unqualified doctors. As a result, most countries strictly regulate the qualifications of medical professionals. This issue seems obvious, but in India, for example, many doctors (sometimes a majority of the practicing physicians in certain

Structural Change and Development Strategies The Foreign Aid Controversy We will now turn to a discussion of the role of foreign aid in development strategies and consider how large should it be as well as how effective it can be. In the optimistic 1960s and 1970s, the dominant view among economists was that more foreign aid would help countries to invest, modernize, and achieve the necessary structural changes while on the road to prosperity. The governments of rich countries have always been criticized for spending too little on foreign aid. Scandinavian countries, which are the most generous donors among Western governments, have, for example, given 3 to 10 times more than the United States on a per capita basis for development aid. Non-governmental organizations and advocates for poor countries continuously lobby for more development aid. Jeffrey Sachs, a professor of economics and Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, has in recent years championed the cause of more generous foreign aid. On the other hand, a more pessimistic and cynical view has emerged that suggests a great part, if not most, of foreign aid has been wasted. The argument is that foreign aid is often diverted by corrupt officials or used inefficiently and therefore has no significant economic effects. William Easterly, an economist who worked at the World Bank for many years and is now a professor at New York University, has been one of the most vocal and competent proponents of this view. In the following sections, we look closely at the main aspects of the foreign aid controversy. China is a good example of a country with strong governmental institutions. China retained its basic authoritarian political structure when it opted to transition to a market economy and chose to follow export promotion strategies. While the initial government emphasis on the creation of markets for the domestic economy was effective, the mobilization of the bureaucracy played a very large role in encouraging growth. The government told provincial leaders that they would get faster promotions within the bureaucracy if they were able to obtain higher economic growth in their province as compared to other provinces. In effect, the Chinese introduced yardstick competition , a contest for the top-ranking economic performance within the Chinese bureaucracy and a policy the government used to rank provincial leaders according to the growth rates of their provinces. The leaders of the provinces that had the fastest growth were quickly promoted to higher levels of government. Given the fact that the Chinese generally find it a desirable goal in life to reach top levels of government administration, this yardstick competition gave leaders a very strong incentive to maximize growth in their provinces. Because the provinces enjoyed sufficient fiscal autonomy, being residual claimants of extra fiscal revenues they raised, provincial leaders had the instruments necessary to encourage economic development and growth.

Institutions and Economic Development Efficient institutional solutions provide critical reductions in transaction costs and contribute to economic development. Informational Problems A simple transaction often involves informational problems, as one party is bound to have more information about a product’s quality than the other party does, a situation that economists call asymmetric information . For example, food distributors may ship food products that were not stored under proper conditions, a used car salesman might sell cars with hidden mechanical problems, a software company may sell an operating system that has programming flaws, or a real estate agent may sell a house that has hidden structural defects. In most cases, the buyer may not have the information necessary to decide whether or not to purchase an item and/or it might be very costly or outright impossible to acquire all the relevant information prior to making a purchase. These informational problems are present in all economies, both developed and less developed. Lack of information about a product and a possible lack of trust in the seller may prevent the buyer from completing the transaction. Because of asymmetric information, many transactions, even legitimate ones, might not take place at all. Asymmetric information is also detrimental to transactions that do not involve the exchange of goods. This is the case for credit contracts, where there is usually an informational asymmetry between the lender and the borrower. The lender does not know the creditworthiness of the borrower, his or her willingness or ability to fulfill a debt contract. Because of asymmetric information, a creditor may refrain from lending even to a very creditworthy individual. Entrepreneurs who have good ideas for the productive use of capital may not be able to realize those ideas because they might be unable to obtain loans to start their businesses. This is a very serious problem in developing economies. Adverse selection. Informational problems may lead to adverse selection , a situation caused by informational asymmetries in which reputable lenders and sellers leave the market to disreputable players, resulting in a possible market collapse. George Akerlof received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his article “The Market for Lemons,” in which he showed how informational asymmetries and adverse selection can cause the disappearance of markets or even severe market failure. 2 He described second-hand car markets in which the seller has information about the quality of the car but the buyer does not. Assume that there are good second-hand cars that cost the seller $10,000 (purchase plus repairs) and are worth $12,000 to consumers. Also assume that there are bad second-hand cars that cost the seller $ ,000 but are worth only $ ,000 to the buyer. If there are no informational asymmetries, good cars would sell and deliver a profit of $ ,000 to the seller and bad cars would not sell because they would deliver a loss of $ ,000. Assume now that there is informational asymmetry and that 50% of the cars are good and 50% are bad. A buyer now faces a 50% chance of buying a car that is worth $12,000 and a 50% chance of buying a 2 George A.

Institutions and Economic Development Compare a simple transaction in a developed and a developing economy the purchase of land by a farmer. In a developed country, land ownership is protected by law, real estate transactions and land surveys are thoroughly recorded, and a dispute over a deed can be resolved in court. A registered title to land can be used as collateral to obtain a loan to finance improvements to the land. In a developing economy, however, this simple transaction can be fraught with many problems. There may be no system to track ownership titles and no surveys of a property’s exact boundaries, so it can be difficult for a poor and often uneducated farmer to defend himself against encroachment by neighbors, who may destroy his crops or dig trenches within the borders of his newly purchased land. Local authorities may evict the farmer without adequate compensation in order to build roads or housing projects. This lack of legal protection tends to support rich and influential landowners and government officials. When a farmer cannot document ownership of his land, a large investment in seed, fertilizer, livestock, or equipment is a risky venture. The farmer will thus be less likely to contribute to the economic development of his country. T his simple example illustrates the importance of institutions that facilitate economic transactions and, thus, economic development. The economic concept of institution is defined as the constraints placed by law and social norms on human behavior. These constraints help reduce transaction costs , the costs associated to simple transactions such as buying or selling merchandise, borrowing money, or investing in a business. Every day, there are millions of transactions by consumers and producers within an economy. Just as tiny streams converge to form a great river, transaction costs contribute to a powerful effect on the aggregate performance of an economy and its growth rate. This chapter examines transaction costs in detail and how they are affected by institutions. We begin our discussion of institutions by defining precisely what they are. We then discuss what institutions can do to reduce transaction costs. We compare institutional development in advanced economies and in developing economies, and get a better understanding for why a lack of more advanced institutions makes transaction costs higher in less-developed countries and creates serious obstacles to their economic development.

Poverty and Inequality and the United States, we nevertheless continue to see a tendency of reduced income inequality. Overall, the economic growth process in China and other parts of Asia has thus reduced income inequality worldwide in recent decades. This result is consistent with the analysis of poverty early in this chapter that showed extreme poverty has tended to decline everywhere except in Africa. Chapter Summary Poverty Measurement and Comparisons International measures of poverty are based on poverty lines. They are calculated as the income necessary to purchase the daily amount of calories necessary to survive, taking into account the usual eating habits of a population. The poverty headcount measures the number of people who are below the poverty line. The poverty gap is calculated by multiplying the poverty headcount by a population’s average distance below the poverty line. Internationally comparable measures of poverty are difficult to determine because the exchange rates between currencies do not accurately reflect differences in the cost of living across countries. Therefore, purchasing power parity exchange rates are preferable to market exchange rates as measures of poverty, although they, too, are not perfect because they reflect average costs of living in a given country rather than the cost of living of the poor. Poverty has tended to decline in the last decades in most regions of the world except Africa. The impressive growth performance of China, India, and Asia as a whole has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Measurements and Comparisons of Income Inequality Two concepts are most often used to measure inequality: the quantile ratio, which measures the ratio of income between the top quantile and the bottom quantile, and the Gini coefficient, which assumes values between zero and 1. A low Gini coefficient means a relatively equal distribution of income, while a high Gini coefficient means a highly unequal distribution of income. Economic Determinants of Inequality Low access to education is associated to high income inequality. Inequality in land ownership is also an important determinant of income inequality. Inequality, Growth, and Development The Kuznets hypothesis states that a country may first become more unequal in income distribution as it grows out of poverty and then it will become more equal again as it becomes rich. The international evidence for the Kuznets curve is weak. Economists have put forward theories based on credit constraints and political economy considerations that indicate income inequality may be bad for economic growth. While inequality has increased over time in many countries in the last 30 years, income inequality worldwide has tended to decrease. The main reason is that as China and India, in particular, have had very strong economic growth, the incomes of billions of people have increased, thereby reducing worldwide income inequality.

Structural Change and Development Strategies Why did export promotion in East Asia work? Export promotion has been the most popular strategy for development in the last 3 decades. Economists do not always agree on the reasons for its success, however. One interpretation, called the neoclassical explanation and favored by famous economists such as Jagdish Bhagwati and Anne Krueger, is that export promotion worked primarily because of its market-friendly philosophy: instead of protecting their industries, countries participated in trade liberalization and encouraged the production of exports for the world market. 14 While governments did intervene to encourage export promotion, their focus was on competition in world markets, not on policies that would distort domestic prices. Moreover, governments kept the macroeconomic fundamentals right, balanced their budgets, placed a strong emphasis on education to foster capital accumulation, maintained low inflation, and kept government intervention to a minimum. However, other economists emphasize the central role played by governments in coordinating investments between firms and in helping particular sectors and firms. They see such government intervention as beneficial in promoting growth. 15 Institutions and export promotion. Despite these controversies, given its success in practice, why has the strategy of export promotion not been implemented everywhere? Why have most countries in Latin America and Africa not implemented similar strategies that follow the Asian example? It seems that the most convincing answer lies in the varying strengths of institutions across countries. A developing country needs a government that is strong enough to be able to organize competition between firms, to set the rules for competition, and to uphold those rules. In other words, there has to be a skilled government bureaucracy in place that is able to understand all aspects of business projects, including technology, management, and marketing. Moreover, the government bureaucracy has to be strong enough to resist the pressure and influence exerted by firms that want to bend the rules in their favor. It is not surprising that the export promotion strategy has, for the most part, only worked in Asia, where countries tend to have strong governmental institutions and highly skilled people working in government administration. 14 Jagdish Bhagwati, “The Miracle That Did Happen: Understanding East Asia in Comparative Perspective,” in Taiwan’s Development Experience: Lessons on Role of Government and Markets, Eric Thorbecke and Henry Wan, eds.

Institutions and Economic Development car that is worth $ ,000. A buyer who is risk neutral , who values upside and downside payoffs equally and weighs them according to their probability, would not be ready to pay more than the expected value (( .5 * 12,000) + ( .5 * 4,000) = $ ,000) for a car. In other words, a risk-neutral agent looks at the expected payoff of a decision: the downside payoff ($ ,000) times its probability (. ) plus the upside payoff ($12,000) times its probability (. ). A riskaverse buyer, who puts less weight on the upside payoff than on the downside payoff for given probabilities, would pay even less or would possibly not even be ready to pay more than $ ,000 to buy the car. In this situation, the seller of a bad car would make a profit of $ ,000, but the seller of a good car would suffer a loss. Compared to a situation of perfect information, asymmetric information would tend to drive out the reputable sellers from the market and attract the disreputable sellers. If the honest sellers withdraw because they cannot make a profit, buyers will soon realize that only bad cars are available for which they are only willing to pay $ ,000, and the market will disappear. Adverse selection also occurs in the credit market. Suppose that there are two types of borrowers, good and bad. The good borrower is creditworthy and needs financing for a project that will earn a 10% return. The bad borrower does not intend to repay the loan at all. The bank must pay depositors an interest rate of 6%, otherwise they will withdraw their deposits and put their money elsewhere. Note that the return on the project for the good borrower (10%) is higher than the market return for depositors ( %). Assume that among the population of potential borrowers there is a 50% chance that a potential borrower is good and a 50% chance that he or she is bad. Without asymmetric information, the bank would not lend to the bad types and would lend only to the good types, making a profit because it could charge the borrowers up to 10% interest. Under asymmetric information, however, the bank cannot discriminate between good and bad borrowers and would have to charge the same interest rate to all borrowers. In order to pay back its depositors, the bank must charge an interest rate of at least 12% ( % divided by 50%, the probability that a loan is paid back). This interest rate will be too high for the good borrowers, who will decide not to apply for a loan, but the bad borrowers would not be discouraged by the high interest rate, because they do not intend to pay back the loan. Good borrowers are thus driven out of the market by the excessively high interest rate. Note that because of adverse selection, the price of credit, the interest rate, cannot serve as an efficient mechanism to adjust supply and demand in credit markets. If there is an excess demand for credit and if banks decide to adjust the interest rate upward to reduce that demand and attract more depositors, the effect is likely to be a decline in the quality of the credit pool, as some good borrowers whose projects have a somewhat lower profitability become discouraged by the higher interest rate while bad borrowers remain undeterred. The bank might reduce its profits by increasing interest rates because of the deterioration of the quality of the credit pool. For that reason, banks prefer not to increase the interest rate to market clearing rates and instead decide to ration credit ( credit rationing ). This means that only some applicants receive a loan and many other applicants are turned down. Obviously, banks try to gather as much information as they can on potential borrowers and use this information

Structural Change and Development Strategies Sachs and the Argument for Foreign Aid Jeffrey Sachs has described in a very eloquent way how foreign aid can help developing countries rise out of poverty. 16 The starting point of his analysis is that poor countries find themselves in a poverty trap . Similar to a household, if a country is very poor, it cannot afford to save because it must allocate all its income to consumption with no resources left for investment. The country is then trapped in a vicious circle: poverty prevents investment and that results in more poverty. However, a country that is able to reach a certain threshold of income can afford to save. There will thus be a positive cycle: investment creates growth that generates more income resulting in more investment. Sachs’s basic idea is that if a country is given enough foreign aid to afford the investments necessary to get out of the poverty trap, it will find itself on a positive growth cycle. All that is necessary is a large, one-shot injection of foreign aid to achieve this objective. Critical to this approach is that the amount of foreign aid must be sufficiently large enough for it to pull a country out of the poverty trap. Sachs argues that foreign aid should simultaneously target education, infrastructure, the environment, and government administration, because the effect of investment in one area of the economy reinforces the effect of investment in another area. For example, more investment in education will create a more skilled labor force that will contribute more to the economy as it takes advantage of the new opportunities created by an advanced telecommunications infrastructure. In other words, there are complementarities between these various investments. This is, in essence, a big-push strategy. Sachs estimates that in order to meet the millennium development goal of halving extreme poverty, that percentage of the population living on less than 1 dollar a day, a global investment of 150 billion dollars would be needed, which is 50 billion above existing worldwide aid commitments. This objective can be achieved if rich countries commit to giving 0. % of their GNP for foreign aid. Currently, aid from the United States represents about 0.15% of its GNP. 17 Easterly and the Skeptics’ View William Easterly worked for the World Bank for 16 years as a research economist trying to find the best policies to help countries grow out of poverty. He strongly disagrees with Sachs’s views on foreign aid. 18 Easterly states that all the foreign aid given to developing countries has little to show in terms of increased growth. Between 1965 and 2000, Africa received $568 billion (in today’s dollars) but had virtually no growth during that period. There is even a negative correlation between aid and growth in Africa—aid to Africa increased while growth tended to decline during the last decades of the 20th century. 16 Jeffrey D. Sachs, The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time (New York: Penguin Press, 2005). 17 As a comparison, the annual U.S. military budget represents between 4 and 7% of GNP, depending on the estimates, and is at least 30 times higher than U.S. foreign aid.

Institutions and Economic Development to decide to whom they allocate credit. While this information search helps to alleviate informational asymmetries, it is usually only a partial solution to the problem: many creditworthy borrowers are still denied loans while untrustworthy borrowers are approved for credit. Moral hazard. Another problem that arises from asymmetric information is moral hazard , the possibility of unobservable actions one of the contracting parties can take that will hurt the interest of the other contracting party. A typical example of moral hazard arises in the relationship between a landlord and a wage laboring farmer. If the landlord pays the farmer an hourly wage to work the land, the farmer may not work as hard as he would if the land were his own because the landlord cannot observe how hard he works and he receives the same wage whether he works hard or not. The difference between moral hazard and adverse selection is not always clear. Moral hazard involves asymmetric information as well as unobservable actions. Adverse selection involves only asymmetric information. Take the example of the automobile insurance market. Assume a situation in which there are good and bad drivers, but all drivers do their best to avoid accidents. This is a case of adverse selection. Drivers differ only in their abilities and insurance companies cannot, without prior investigation, distinguish between good and bad drivers when offering an insurance contract. Now assume a situation in which all drivers are equally good but they may decide to drive less carefully because they know they are insured. This is a case of moral hazard in which the action taken is how carefully to drive. In the case of a credit relationship, the difference between adverse selection and moral hazard is blurred. Adverse selection occurs if the quality of the loan is independent of actions taken by the borrower, as is the case if the borrower is intrinsically dishonest or incompetent. On the other hand, there is a moral hazard problem when the quality of the loan depends on the actions of the borrower. The borrower can deliberately choose a riskier project or fail to take the necessary actions to make the project profitable. In reality, a combination of both moral hazard and adverse selection exists, but it is important to keep in mind the conceptual difference between them. Institutional solutions to informational problems. The obligation by one or more parties to a transaction to disclose information relevant to the transaction is referred to as disclosure rules , legal solutions to informational problems such as in the case of the sale of a house or a company that is listed publicly. The seller of a house must, for example, disclose information on past repairs or damages to the house. Executives of a company listed for sale must reveal information about their business dealings and about their governance. In many professions, there is regulation of access or entry , rules that govern entry into and the practice of a profession, and require a candidate to earn a qualified diploma or pass an exam as a means to screen out unqualified people. This is the case for doctors; without rules for entering the medical profession, consumers would have no formal way to distinguish between qualified and unqualified doctors. As a result, most countries strictly regulate the qualifications of medical professionals. This issue seems obvious, but in India, for example, many doctors (sometimes a majority of the practicing physicians in certain

As a result, most countries strictly regulate the qualifications of medical professionals. This issue seems obvious, but in India, for example, many doctors (sometimes a majority of the practicing physicians in certain 


Institutions and Economic Development areas) do not have a medical degree. These “doctors” are often completely incompetent: they are unable to make correct diagnoses and tend to prescribe unnecessary medicines. 3 Other solutions to informational problems are the result of actions taken by firms that are sometimes backed by legal institutions. An obvious example is the association of a warranty (the obligation by a seller to guarantee the quality of a product) with a sales contract. Warranties take different forms, such as a guarantee to repair goods for free within a specified amount of time after the purchase of a good or after the replacement of a deficient component of that good. Return policies allow the buyer to bring purchased goods back to the seller within a specified time after their purchase. Warranties and return policies make it possible for the seller to give credible information about the product. If consumers can learn quickly about the quality or usefulness of a product, a return policy signals to a buyer that the seller is confident in the quality of the product. If it requires long-term use of a product to determine its quality, a warranty is a better way to signal quality to a consumer by shifting any repair risk onto the seller. Sellers also use brand names to indicate quality. Signaling is an economic term that means taking certain actions to provide other parties in a transaction with credible information. In the case of a sales contract, it means giving credible information to consumers about the quality of a product. Consumers consider a well-known brand name with a reputation for good quality to be reliable, and they will trust products from that brand. The company that has established a brand name has an interest in keeping its reputation because it is the basis for consumer trust in its products. Entering a franchise contract allows an entrepreneur to benefit from the reputation of a brand, which makes it possible to attract customers more easily. Franchising allows businesses to expand very easily, but firms need to monitor their franchisees, as loss of brand reputation can be quite damaging. In China, the developing world’s largest economy, there has been an expansion of franchised fast-food chains in recent years with KFC and McDonalds from the United States, Ajisen Ramen or Saizeriya from Japan, or even Chinese fastfood chains such as Da Niang Dumpling and Ji Xiang Wanton. According to the marketing research firm A. C. Nielsen, food hygiene security is cited as the top reason for the popularity of fast-food chains in China, as opposed to restaurants. This concern is understandable; cases of food poisoning in Chinese restaurants have increased in recent years. For example, the Xinhua News Agency reported that in 2007, 258 people died from food poisoning in China, an increase of 32% over 2006. Some fast-food chains in China have failed precisely because they were not able to build a reputation for safe food. This was the case for Rong Hua Chicken, which tried to compete directly with KFC. The chain was started in 1994, but had closed by 2000 because it was unable to enforce strict rules on the quality of raw and processed foods, leading to safety concerns. Chain stores also rely on the logic of brand recognition. We know familiar names such as CVS, Best Buy, or Walmart in the United States, but there are 3 See, for example, Jishnu Das and Jeffrey Hammer, “Which Doctor?

Institutions and Economic Development promise to pay for the bicycle before its delivery, but it may no longer be optimal to pay once the delivery has occurred, especially if the buyer can renege with no consequences. Consequences of the lack of commitment. The inability to commit hurts both parties in a transaction and is, in many cases, an impediment to transactions. There are also situations in which one party’s inability to commit weakens its bargaining power and renders its threats not credible to the other party. For example, a government could commit to a non-negotiation policy with terrorists or pirates who take hostages, but might be unable to resist the pressure to negotiate once such a hostage situation occurs. This wavering of resolve weakens the government’s bargaining power and invites further hostagetaking actions. Credibility , a party’s ability to uphold the commitments it makes, plays an important role in monetary and fiscal policy. A government might promise not to run fiscal deficits, but before an election, it could abandon that commitment by raising expenditures to garner votes. Lack of credibility in this case means that agents will expect fiscal deficits and behave accordingly. In particular, a central bank may want to announce a tight monetary policy, but may later engage in unexpected monetary expansion to stimulate the economy. The central bank’s lack of credibility will lead agents to expect inflation to be higher than the targets announced by the central bank. A monopoly may be unable to commit to maintain current prices once it has sold to the customers with the highest willingness to pay, as has often been the case with new types of computers, DVD players, and with flat-screen TVs. Initially, these televisions were quite expensive and many consumers preferred to wait for the price to fall, secure in their knowledge that the manufacturers would drop their prices as soon as demand declined, regardless of announcements made to the contrary. In this case, if the monopoly could make credible commitments not to lower prices, consumers would not wait for the price to fall before making a purchase. Institutional solutions to the commitment problem. When formal institutions are reliable, contract enforcement plays a crucial role in solving commitment problems. The parties draw up a contract that makes commitment legally binding and possibly provides specific penalties for breach of contract. If one party reneges on a commitment, the other can go to court to punish the guilty party. This “third-party enforcement” serves as a powerful instrument to solve commitment problems. Legally enforceable contracts thus help to “tie one’s hands,” which is usually beneficial for both parties. Solving the commitment problem by legally binding contracts does not necessarily imply rigidity. A contract may specify actions that are no longer optimal for both parties. For example, two companies may have a delivery contract for a certain good over a certain period of time. If the producer comes up with a new product that is both less costly to produce and gives more utility to the buyer, the two parties can agree to void the existing contract or to draw up a new agreement. However, the existing contract still protects each party to the contract. If the two agree to void a contract, it must indeed be the case that both are made better off, and no one suffers from the decision.

Institutions and Economic Development Compare a simple transaction in a developed and a developing economy the purchase of land by a farmer. In a developed country, land ownership is protected by law, real estate transactions and land surveys are thoroughly recorded, and a dispute over a deed can be resolved in court. A registered title to land can be used as collateral to obtain a loan to finance improvements to the land. In a developing economy, however, this simple transaction can be fraught with many problems. There may be no system to track ownership titles and no surveys of a property’s exact boundaries, so it can be difficult for a poor and often uneducated farmer to defend himself against encroachment by neighbors, who may destroy his crops or dig trenches within the borders of his newly purchased land. Local authorities may evict the farmer without adequate compensation in order to build roads or housing projects. This lack of legal protection tends to support rich and influential landowners and government officials. When a farmer cannot document ownership of his land, a large investment in seed, fertilizer, livestock, or equipment is a risky venture. The farmer will thus be less likely to contribute to the economic development of his country. T his simple example illustrates the importance of institutions that facilitate economic transactions and, thus, economic development. The economic concept of institution is defined as the constraints placed by law and social norms on human behavior. These constraints help reduce transaction costs , the costs associated to simple transactions such as buying or selling merchandise, borrowing money, or investing in a business. Every day, there are millions of transactions by consumers and producers within an economy. Just as tiny streams converge to form a great river, transaction costs contribute to a powerful effect on the aggregate performance of an economy and its growth rate. This chapter examines transaction costs in detail and how they are affected by institutions. We begin our discussion of institutions by defining precisely what they are. We then discuss what institutions can do to reduce transaction costs. We compare institutional development in advanced economies and in developing economies, and get a better understanding for why a lack of more advanced institutions makes transaction costs higher in less-developed countries and creates serious obstacles to their economic development.

Institutions and Economic Development Informal solutions to the hold-up problem. If legal protections against the hold-up problem are insufficient, then a widespread solution is vertical integration , a situation in which two firms working together as supplier and client merge into a single firm. In the hold-up example above, vertical integration means that axle and truck production would be part of the same firm. The truck company would produce the axles it needs because the axle subcontractor does not trust the truck manufacturer enough to be ready to make an investment in a joint business deal. This solution might be inefficient and the cost of producing the axles inside the truck firm might be higher than using a subcontractor. Because there are fewer legal protections in developing countries, firms should have more incentives to engage in vertical integration. Unfortunately, the obstacles to achieving vertical integration are also higher because it requires a high level of capital to operate properly. In a poor country, this level of capital is more difficult to achieve due to less pre-existing wealth and underdeveloped capital markets. Most multinational corporations that operate in developing countries are vertically integrated and control the complete manufacturing process from raw materials to the final product. They do not face the severe capital constraints that confront domestic firms in developing countries because they are able to raise funds on international capital markets. Operating as vertically integrated units in developing countries is therefore less of a problem for multinational corporations than for domestic firms. Social norms might also work to mitigate the hold-up problem by reducing the amount of opportunistic behavior, but it is debatable by how much. Economists are skeptical of the effectiveness of social norms to eliminate this behavior because they tend to think that economic agents pursue their own self-interest. Social norms work well only to the extent that there are credible punishment mechanisms for those who deviate from them. The Commitment Problem In all types of behavior, when one party reneges on prior commitments made to another party in the course of joint transactions, it is referred to as the commitment problem . This widespread problem occurs in all kinds of transactions but is potentially present in all sequential transactions that do not take place at the same time but rather in a certain order. Take the simple transaction of purchasing a bicycle. The transaction is simultaneous if the buyer delivers the money at the same time that the seller transfers ownership of the bike. The same transaction is sequential if ownership precedes the money transfer or vice-versa. In any sequential transaction, a commitment problem can occur; if the buyer is to pay after delivery of the bike, she may take it but fail to pay for it. Similarly, if delivery occurs after payment, the seller may renege on his promise to deliver the bicycle after he receives the buyer’s money. The commitment problem is very general and does not require any investment or sunk cost. Commitment problems arise because the optimal choice for one of the contracting parties at one point in time is no longer optimal at a later stage. Economists call this difference in the optimality of decisions at different periods in time time inconsistency . In our bicycle example, it is optimal to

Institutions and Economic Development What Are Institutions? Following the example of Douglass North, Nobel Prize-winning economist, we define institutions as constraints on behavior imposed by societal rules: “Institutions include any form of constraint that human beings devise to shape human interaction.” 1 This broad definition includes all constraints imposed on individuals and groups by a society’s system of beliefs and values. People who live in the advanced economies of the world often take institutions for granted. Even mainstream economics has long ignored them; it explains how the price mechanism helps balance supply and demand, but says very little about the institutions underlying efficiently functioning markets. A simple transaction such as a purchase of a commodity can be fraught with uncertainty without an adequate institutional environment. A commodity purchase requires the transfer of that commodity from the seller to the buyer and the transfer of payment from the buyer to the seller. If the two operations are not synchronized, there may be problems, depending on who moves first. If the buyer makes the payment first, the seller may never show up to deliver the goods, but if the seller transfers the goods first, the buyer may never bring the payment. Even if the operations in a transaction are synchronized, cheating is possible. The buyer may write a check that will bounce or the seller may hide important information from the buyer about the product sold. The more sophisticated the transaction, the more opportunities there are for cheating and predatory behavior. Without adequate institutions, transactions are much more costly and the volume of transactions will then be much lower and less economic development will take place. Formal Institutions In some societies, formal institutions are codified in writing and are generally more precise than unwritten rules. Speed limits that specify how fast we can drive and electoral laws that incorporate the procedures for translating votes in an election into seats in a legislature are examples of formal institutions. Authorities can enforce formal rules with established statutes, which are also officially recorded. When talking about a country’s formal institutions, it is useful to distinguish between political and legal institutions. Political institutions. Political institutions are the set of rules that define the powers of the major political bodies and players (chief executive, legislators, etc.), and how they are selected. Political institutions determine the differences between political regimes, such as democracies and dictatorships. Democratic institutions make it possible to oust politicians who have misbehaved or change leaders when ideological preferences among the electorate have shifted, options that are not possible under a dictatorship. Usually, democracies incorporate separation of powers, whereas dictators hold all the power in 1 Douglass North, Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990): 3.

Economic Growth Empirical Analysis of Economic Growth According to the growth theories we discussed above, the accumulation of physical and human capital, technological progress, and population growth play important roles in explaining a country’s growth rate. In this section, we analyze the determinants of growth empirically. We start by asking what drives the main differences in the levels of income between rich countries that historically have had high growth and poor countries that have had lower growth. Table 1 shows 1) output per worker in different countries as a ratio of the U.S. level; 2) the contribution of capital (calculated here from the Cobb- Douglas production function as the capital output ratio to the power of one-half); 18 3) the contribution of human capital; and 4) total factor productivity when the latter is computed residually as in growth accounting. The data are from 1988 and taken from the Penn World Tables. They are measured in purchasing power parity. Output per worker is very highly correlated with long-term growth and thus can be seen as a measure of that growth. In Table 1, we also see that Canada has about 94% of the productivity of the United States. It has about the same capital output ratio and the same level of total factor productivity, but a lower level of human capital. Differences in human capital are thus the main determinant of the difference in productivity between Canada and the United States. Let us look now at the data for developing economies: differences in total factor productivity are the main reason for differences in output per worker (labor productivity) with the United States. Take China. Its productivity level in 1988 was about 6% of that of the United States (in purchasing power parity terms). The contribution of capital was close to 90% that of the United States and its level of human capital was about two-thirds that of the United States. Its total factor productivity 18 This is derived from a model including human capital in which y t = ¢ K t Y t ≤ a 1 a h t A t , where h t = H t / L t is human capital per worker, and where a = 1/ . Third, developing countries can achieve better economic outcomes if they have quicker access to technological transfers, even if there is a price in terms of reduced incentives to innovate in the richer countries. From the economists’ point of view, knowledge externalities mean that overly strict enforcement of property rights is not optimal in terms of encouraging development in poor countries. There is an optimal trade-off between lower profits for innovating firms (and maybe a slightly lower innovation rate) and the benefits to developing countries from technological transfers. While it is hard to believe that Microsoft has less incentive to innovate because China and other developing countries pirate its software products, a total lack of enforcement of intellectual property rights is not the way to go either. As always, the difficulty is finding that optimal trade-off in practice. This discussion leads us to ask this question: Are advanced industrialized countries insisting on too much enforcement of intellectual property rights in WTO negotiations? Perhaps poor countries have a valid point by organizing to impose an agenda at WTO meetings that would be friendlier toward the interests of developing countries.

Institutions and Economic Development fundamental part of culture and encompasses most of the beliefs, values, and social norms in many societies. Interactions between Institutions There are complex interactions between formal and informal institutions. First, laws often evolve with culture and social norms. The death penalty, for example, was a popular method of punishment until many countries did away with it as a result of rising popular opposition. Second, it is very difficult to impose formal laws or formal institutions that are not in accordance with existing social norms; conflict between formal institutions and social norms can create conflict in developing countries. For example, international borders established in Africa after decolonization did not correspond to existing ethnic subdivisions. Tribes were separated across formal borders, but (informal) tribal and ethnic loyalties took precedence over (formal) national loyalties. As a result, politics polarized along ethnic lines, resulting in violence. Legal systems inherited from former colonial powers conflicted with social norms associated with tribalism. Even though there were formal rules prohibiting nepotism, politicians favored their families and friends because this favoritism was seen as the fulfillment of long-established moral obligations to fellow tribe members. Similarly, in a country where social norms are based on religion, it is very difficult to impose laws that appear to violate religious obligations, prohibitions, or constraints. A case in point is the prohibition of the Islamic veil in schools and public places in certain countries, which is seen by practicing Muslims as violating their religious norms. Third, formal institutions often strengthen the effects of informal institutions. The social norm of honesty is supported by a legal system punishing a dishonest trader and makes that norm easier to enforce throughout the society. Similarly, informal institutions often complement and reinforce formal institutions; legal codes may be incomplete and social norms can help to supplement them and make them more effective. In some legal systems, citizens are obligated by law to help someone who has had an accident or whose life is in jeopardy. Even when the law does not specify in detail when this legal obligation applies, social norms provide the moral obligation to help a person in danger. Formal and informal institutions tend to be complementary and to have increased effectiveness in a society or culture when they are based on the same fundamental set of beliefs. If they are in conflict, formal institutions do not work as well as established social norms. What Do Institutions Do? As we discuss the economic role of institutions, we will examine five important problems that occur in basic economic transactions and show how institutions can help to solve these problems: informational problems, hold-up problems, commitment problems, cooperation problems, and coordination problems. The solutions to these problems have significant economic effects on the development of commerce, entrepreneurship, trade, innovation, and investment.

Institutions and Economic Development Informal solutions to the hold-up problem. If legal protections against the hold-up problem are insufficient, then a widespread solution is vertical integration , a situation in which two firms working together as supplier and client merge into a single firm. In the hold-up example above, vertical integration means that axle and truck production would be part of the same firm. The truck company would produce the axles it needs because the axle subcontractor does not trust the truck manufacturer enough to be ready to make an investment in a joint business deal. This solution might be inefficient and the cost of producing the axles inside the truck firm might be higher than using a subcontractor. Because there are fewer legal protections in developing countries, firms should have more incentives to engage in vertical integration. Unfortunately, the obstacles to achieving vertical integration are also higher because it requires a high level of capital to operate properly. In a poor country, this level of capital is more difficult to achieve due to less pre-existing wealth and underdeveloped capital markets. Most multinational corporations that operate in developing countries are vertically integrated and control the complete manufacturing process from raw materials to the final product. They do not face the severe capital constraints that confront domestic firms in developing countries because they are able to raise funds on international capital markets. Operating as vertically integrated units in developing countries is therefore less of a problem for multinational corporations than for domestic firms. Social norms might also work to mitigate the hold-up problem by reducing the amount of opportunistic behavior, but it is debatable by how much. Economists are skeptical of the effectiveness of social norms to eliminate this behavior because they tend to think that economic agents pursue their own self-interest. Social norms work well only to the extent that there are credible punishment mechanisms for those who deviate from them. The Commitment Problem In all types of behavior, when one party reneges on prior commitments made to another party in the course of joint transactions, it is referred to as the commitment problem . This widespread problem occurs in all kinds of transactions but is potentially present in all sequential transactions that do not take place at the same time but rather in a certain order. Take the simple transaction of purchasing a bicycle. The transaction is simultaneous if the buyer delivers the money at the same time that the seller transfers ownership of the bike. The same transaction is sequential if ownership precedes the money transfer or vice-versa. In any sequential transaction, a commitment problem can occur; if the buyer is to pay after delivery of the bike, she may take it but fail to pay for it. Similarly, if delivery occurs after payment, the seller may renege on his promise to deliver the bicycle after he receives the buyer’s money. The commitment problem is very general and does not require any investment or sunk cost. Commitment problems arise because the optimal choice for one of the contracting parties at one point in time is no longer optimal at a later stage. Economists call this difference in the optimality of decisions at different periods in time time inconsistency . In our bicycle example, it is optimal to

Institutions and Economic Development promising a high price once the crop was mature. The farmer changes crops, and for the first year, harvests cacao beans from which cocoa is produced. If the food company comes back and offers a lower price for the crop, the farmer is still forced to sell to the food company or face the loss of an entire year’s income. Another example occurs in the rental market. If a farmer who is leasing land from a landlord has made significant efforts to improve the productivity of the land by building irrigation systems using his own money and effort, he may be evicted by the landlord, who can charge a higher price to other farmers because of the improvements, or can threaten to evict the farmer unless he agrees to an increase in the rental price. The hold-up problem is more acute the more relationship specific the investment is. In the axle example, the investment to produce axles only has value when the subcontractor sells the axles to the specific truck manufacturing company. When an investment only has value in the context of a specific partnership with another firm, this relationship specificity is also called asset specificity . If the axle producer can sell the same axles to another truck company, the hold-up problem is solved because there are alternative uses for the investment. If the truck manufacturer knows this, he may refrain from trying to lower the price after the investment is made. Even if the axles are specific to a particular contract, the hold-up problem might still be mitigated if the prior investment can be restructured at a relatively low cost for alternative uses. Suppose that the subcontractor producing the axles can restructure his facility to produce metal parts for the construction industry; he might opt to do that instead of submitting to the demands of the truck manufacturer to lower the price of the axles. Note that the hold-up problem is not related to informational asymmetries. The axle producer knows that the truck manufacturer will have an interest in holding it up. The hold-up problem is related to asset-specificity, the sunk cost of investment and opportunistic behavior. Institutional solutions to the hold-up problem. Binding and legally enforceable contracts are the primary solution to the hold-up problem. If the buyer is contractually obligated to buy products from the subcontractor at a specified price, the problem should disappear. Countries with strong legal institutions have an advantage over countries with weak institutions in terms of the holdup problem. However, legal institutions do not always provide full protection against hold-ups. Because contracts are often incomplete and lack specific details, it is often possible for a buyer to invoke a contingency that was not built into the initial contract and lay the blame on the seller. One tactic is to claim that certain characteristics of a product that were not actually specified in the contract are not as initially agreed upon. Many of these claims are often not very credible, but it can be costly to mount a defense against them in court. The truck manufacturer can threaten the axle subcontractor with legal proceedings unless the axles’ price is renegotiated downward, and the subcontractor may not have the resources to defend himself. Between the costs of a lower axle price and the cost of a lawsuit, the subcontractor may choose the lower axle price. The less detailed the contract, the more possibilities there are for hold-up.

If a farmer who is leasing land from a landlord has made significant efforts to improve the productivity of the land by building irrigation systems using his own money and effort, he may be evicted by the landlord, who can charge a higher price to other farmers because of the improvements, or can threaten to evict the farmer unless he agrees to an increase in the rental price. The hold-up problem is more acute the more relationship specific the investment is. In the axle example, the investment to produce axles only has value when the subcontractor sells the axles to the specific truck manufacturing company. When an investment only has value in the context of a specific partnership with another firm, this relationship specificity is also called asset specificity . If the axle producer can sell the same axles to another truck company, the hold-up problem is solved because there are alternative uses for the investment. If the truck manufacturer knows this, he may refrain from trying to lower the price after the investment is made. Even if the axles are specific to a particular contract, the hold-up problem might still be mitigated if the prior investment can be restructured at a relatively low cost for alternative uses. Suppose that the subcontractor producing the axles can restructure his facility to produce metal parts for the construction industry; he might opt to do that instead of submitting to the demands of the truck manufacturer to lower the price of the axles. Note that the hold-up problem is not related to informational asymmetries. The axle producer knows that the truck manufacturer will have an interest in holding it up. The hold-up problem is related to asset-specificity, the sunk cost of investment and opportunistic behavior. Institutional solutions to the hold-up problem. Binding and legally enforceable contracts are the primary solution to the hold-up problem. If the buyer is contractually obligated to buy products from the subcontractor at a specified price, the problem should disappear. Countries with strong legal institutions have an advantage over countries with weak institutions in terms of the holdup problem. However, legal institutions do not always provide full protection against hold-ups. Because contracts are often incomplete and lack specific details, it is often possible for a buyer to invoke a contingency that was not built into the initial contract and lay the blame on the seller. One tactic is to claim that certain characteristics of a product that were not actually specified in the contract are not as initially agreed upon. Many of these claims are often not very credible, but it can be costly to mount a defense against them in court. The truck manufacturer can threaten the axle subcontractor with legal proceedings unless the axles’ price is renegotiated downward, and the subcontractor may not have the resources to defend himself. Between the costs of a lower axle price and the cost of a lawsuit, the subcontractor may choose the lower axle price. The less detailed the contract, the more possibilities there are for hold-up. 


Institutions and Economic Development a government. Therefore, the rule of law is usually better enforced in democracies than in dictatorships. This is not always the case, however; there can be imperfect democracies as well as beneficial dictatorships. For example, in several Asian countries, such as Singapore, there are political regimes that are not democratic, but they still uphold the rule of law. Legal institutions. Non-political institutions codified by laws, legal institutions across the globe differ in many ways, and these differences can have important economic effects. Some legal institutions are strongly rooted in religion as is the case in certain Islamic countries where Sharia law, expressed in the Qur’an, is both religious law and moral code, and in Israel, where the Talmud is the foundation of many laws. Ancient cultures such as the Chinese or the Hindu civilizations have developed their own legal traditions based on customs that date back thousands of years. Legal institutions not derived from religious traditions fall into two main categories: the common law and the civil-law systems. The common-law system , developed in England and other Anglo-Saxon countries (Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for example), is based on customary Saxon law, the law that existed in England before the Norman invasion of 1066. Legal arguments in the common-law system rely heavily on legal precedents, decisions made in past court cases. Civil-law systems rely mostly on recorded legal statutes and have developed from Roman civil law. Legal arguments in the civil-law system are made on the basis of the consistency or inconsistency of a decision with the principles laid down in statutory law. These different legal systems are important to economic development because the legal systems in many developing countries were inherited from former colonizers. British colonies inherited the common-law system, while Spanish and French colonies inherited the civil-law system. Informal Institutions Informal institutions are those that are not legally codified; they are based on social norms (or conventions ), accepted and expected standards of behavior. They are enforced in an informal way using peer pressure, feelings of guilt, and moral obligations. Even when a country is ruled by formal institutions, informal institutions still play a large role in terms of politeness and civility, hospitality, courtship, traditions, holiday celebrations, and rites of passage. Even in a country where formal laws exist, disputes between citizens are often solved first by referring to mutually understood and accepted social norms. When informal institutions cannot solve a problem, people turn to formal institutions. Informal institutions are based on a country’s culture , the set of beliefs and values passed down from generation to generation. Beliefs concern nature, interactions between humans and nature, and interactions among humans in a society. Values , the intrinsic worth a culture or society places on certain behaviors and beliefs, determine the set of social norms in a society. Religion is a 


Institutions and Economic Development What Are Institutions? Following the example of Douglass North, Nobel Prize-winning economist, we define institutions as constraints on behavior imposed by societal rules: “Institutions include any form of constraint that human beings devise to shape human interaction.” 1 This broad definition includes all constraints imposed on individuals and groups by a society’s system of beliefs and values. People who live in the advanced economies of the world often take institutions for granted. Even mainstream economics has long ignored them; it explains how the price mechanism helps balance supply and demand, but says very little about the institutions underlying efficiently functioning markets. A simple transaction such as a purchase of a commodity can be fraught with uncertainty without an adequate institutional environment. A commodity purchase requires the transfer of that commodity from the seller to the buyer and the transfer of payment from the buyer to the seller. If the two operations are not synchronized, there may be problems, depending on who moves first. If the buyer makes the payment first, the seller may never show up to deliver the goods, but if the seller transfers the goods first, the buyer may never bring the payment. Even if the operations in a transaction are synchronized, cheating is possible. The buyer may write a check that will bounce or the seller may hide important information from the buyer about the product sold. The more sophisticated the transaction, the more opportunities there are for cheating and predatory behavior. Without adequate institutions, transactions are much more costly and the volume of transactions will then be much lower and less economic development will take place. Formal Institutions In some societies, formal institutions are codified in writing and are generally more precise than unwritten rules. Speed limits that specify how fast we can drive and electoral laws that incorporate the procedures for translating votes in an election into seats in a legislature are examples of formal institutions. Authorities can enforce formal rules with established statutes, which are also officially recorded. When talking about a country’s formal institutions, it is useful to distinguish between political and legal institutions. Political institutions. Political institutions are the set of rules that define the powers of the major political bodies and players (chief executive, legislators, etc.), and how they are selected. Political institutions determine the differences between political regimes, such as democracies and dictatorships. Democratic institutions make it possible to oust politicians who have misbehaved or change leaders when ideological preferences among the electorate have shifted, options that are not possible under a dictatorship. Usually, democracies incorporate separation of powers, whereas dictators hold all the power in 1 Douglass North, Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990): 3.

Institutions and Economic Development similar examples of opportunistic sellers on markets in developing countries who contribute to consumers’ lack of trust and slow the development of reliable markets, putting poor countries at a double disadvantage. Not only are developing countries more likely to have weaker formal institutions, but the informal institution of reputation is less effective without the support of formal institutions and without good circulation of information. The Hold-Up Problem A widespread problem in business contracts, the hold-up problem , refers to a situation in which a business partnership requires an investment from one of the parties that is specific to the transaction in question. Once the investment has been made, however, the other partner “holds up” the party that made the investment in order to renegotiate the deal. For example, suppose a truck manufacturer in India agrees to subcontract the production of axles to another party. An investment of $10,000 is needed to produce the axles and it costs $20 to produce each axle, including the cost of capital. The truck manufacturer contracts an order of 1,000 axles and promises a price of $30 per axle. At that price, the transaction, based on the order of 1,000 axles, makes it possible for the axle subcontractor to break even, since he will be able to recover both the investment cost and the production costs. Indeed, the cost will be $10,000 + ($20 * 1,000) = 30,000 and sales will be $30,000. Once the axle company has made the investment in the machines to produce axles, however, the truck manufacturer tells the subcontractor that he is now ready to pay only $25 for an axle. What does the subcontractor do? He has the choice of either producing the axles at the lower price of $25 or not producing at all. If he does not produce, he loses $10,000, but if he goes ahead with production, he will only lose $ ,000 (his operating profit will be $25 * 1,000 ($20 * 1,000) $10,000 = $ ,000); as a result, the subcontractor will prefer to produce the axles. Because the investment cost is already sunk ( sunk cost ), the only thing that matters in deciding whether or not to produce the axles is the difference between sales ($25 * 1,000) and operating costs ($20 * 1,000), which is $ ,000. 6 Because the subcontractor will decide to produce, even though he will incur a loss, the truck manufacturer can take advantage of the subcontractor’s situation when proposing the lower price. The truck manufacturer is holding up the subcontractor, taking advantage of the subcontractor’s weaker bargaining position after he has made the investment. If the subcontractor had known the truck manufacturer was going to behave in this manner, then he would not have invested in the first place. A profitable investment opportunity can thus be lost because of the hold-up problem. In general, hold-up problems cause underinvestment, which is economically damaging in particular in developing countries. Hold-ups are not confined to specific industries. Suppose the representative of a food company convinced a farmer to change crops and produce cocoa, 6 Remember the notion of sunk cost. Once a cost has been incurred and cannot be recovered, it should not count in economic calculations of future choices. We apply this principle here. 


Institutions and Economic Development There are also coordination games with equilibria that are not all equally efficient. Imagine the very relevant situation in developing countries where people can either decide to be law-abiding citizens or to engage in illegal activities. They would choose to be law-abiding citizens if there were a significant chance that they would be caught in the commission of a crime, but would engage in illegal activities if there were a low chance of being apprehended. The police have limited resources to fight crime, so the probability of being caught depends on the number of people engaged in illegal activities. If few people break the law, then the probability of being caught is high and it is preferable to be honest, but if many break the law, the probability is lower and there are more incentives to engage in illegal activities. We have two equilibria: one in which people are honest under the rule of law and one in which people engage in illegal activities with no adequate law enforcement, and thus no rule of law. If the rule of law is a condition for productive investment to take place, which is crucial for growth, then the rule of law equilibrium will be better for citizens in the long run. Here again, an individual’s choice depends on the choice of others. Understanding coordination problems is important in the context of development for a variety of reasons. First, the social norms that have emerged in various countries are quite diverse. Norms of politeness vary greatly among countries and a lack of knowledge of these norms can easily lead to social misunderstandings. In some Asian countries, for example, entering a house or even a restaurant without taking off your shoes is extremely impolite. Norms of conversation in parts of East Africa require repeating what the previous speaker said before expressing one’s own opinion. Second, we can observe in many countries coordination on a suboptimal equilibrium with a low level of law abidance, high levels of tax evasion, a large informal sector, and a high level of acceptance for corruption. Reforms that help a country shift from one equilibrium to the other are very difficult to design and implement because they require a collective effort that, as seen above, can be difficult to achieve. Diagnosing the problem is often easier than finding an effective and practical solution. Coordination and “big push” strategies. If there is little infrastructure (ports, roads, or electricity), private investors will be reluctant to invest in a country because their investment will not be very productive without infrastructure. A government, in turn, will not want to spend money on infrastructure if it thinks that there will be little private investment. This results in a coordination equilibrium, where there is minimal infrastructure and minimal private investment. We can interpret the “big push” idea as an attempt to move from that low investment equilibrium to one in which there are high levels of both infrastructure and private investment. If there is a well-established infrastructure, private firms will be more willing to invest in the country and the government will be more willing to invest in the infrastructure if it thinks there will be significant private investment. The “big push” strategy consists of providing aid for infrastructure investment while simultaneously developing policies to encourage private investment. 


Institutions and Economic Development each other again before their appointment, it is likely that both will go to the Central Station. This is an example of a focal point. Conventions are usually well understood within a country or a particular culture, but not always across countries. In many cultures, a nod of the head up and down means “yes,” while a movement of the head back and forth from left to right means “no.” When greeting someone, Americans shake hands, but the Japanese bow. The exchange of business cards is fundamental to business etiquette in most of Asia, but not in many other countries. In the Middle East, showing the sole of your shoe to somebody else is considered an insult. Similar body movements or actions can have different interpretations in different societies. There are hundreds, probably thousands of social cues that differ across cultures and can make cross-cultural communication difficult, even when the language barrier is not significant. It is always respectful in a foreign country to show the locals that you have some knowledge of their local customs and conventions. Many social norms are not necessarily fundamental for economic development. Some norms may, however, play a very important role: norms of honesty and trust, norms of conflict resolution (peaceful or violent), norms of equality between men and women, norms related to individual savings behavior, or norms related to effort. The Persistence of Inefficient Institutions In this chapter, we have seen how institutions help solve economic problems that stem from lack of information, commitment, and cooperation or coordination problems. While developed countries have institutions to solve these problems, developing countries are often not as fortunate. The lack of formal institutions impedes economic growth by raising the costs of transactions and slowing the flow of capital into a developing country. If improving institutions is crucial for successful development, we should ask why it is not happening. Reforming institutions is not as simple as signing a contract between two individuals. Inefficient institutions can even persist for a very long time and for a variety of complex reasons. The Functionalist Fallacy We have seen what institutions do, but not why institutions are in place. Understanding the functions that institutions perform is one thing; understanding why they emerge is another. Institutions, just like technical innovations, are often the unintended consequences of actions designed to solve other problems. We know what microwave ovens do; they have become indispensable household appliances to warm or defrost food quickly. The microwave oven can warm a meal much faster than a traditional oven but that was not the purpose its inventor had in mind. It was an accidental byproduct of research to make better radar systems. Dr. Percy Spencer, an engineer working for the Raytheon Corporation, was testing a vacuum tube called a magnetron while researching improvements to conventional radar when he noticed that a candy bar in his pocket had melted.

Institutions and Economic Development agricultural markets, the largest trading firms always do business with the same suppliers and customers. 4 Having a large number of these time-tested relationships is seen by the traders as the biggest determinant of success in business. These business contacts are not only used to exchange information, but also to share risks and to borrow or lend money when necessary. In the 1990s, during the turbulent period of transition in Russia’s market economy, legal institutions were very weak; as a result, firms developed repeated business relationships with a fixed set of suppliers and clients and were reluctant to enter into new business relationships. 5 In a situation of relational contracting, breach of trust can be fatal to the relationship. If a partner deviates from honest behavior, his or her counterpart could end the relationship immediately, forcing the now-unreliable partner to face the uncertainty of the market environment. Because the prospect of finding another reliable trading partner in the market is fraught with informational asymmetries, the threat of terminating the relationship can serve as a deterrent to opportunistic behavior. Less competition for new partners, and buyers and sellers stuck in unprofitable relationships creates an environment that will hinder market growth. The expansion of markets is stronger when formal institutions work to enforce contractual solutions to informational asymmetries. Reputation also plays a role when formal institutions are deficient. Economic agents who build a reputation of honesty, reliability, and efficiency will benefit because their reputations will make them desirable business partners. Reputable buyers and sellers have fewer incentives to indulge in opportunistic behavior due to the significant investments of time and effort necessary to acquire their good reputations. However, in order for reputations to be effective when formal institutions are deficient, there has to be an adequate and efficient circulation of information. Without this movement, information about reputations does not move through the marketplace. In the modern world, communicating this information is easy because it is available instantaneously on the Internet, whether through e-mail, blogs, or social media. Unfortunately, poor countries are at a disadvantage because information technology is not well developed in them. In many of these countries, the primary means of disseminating information is still by word of mouth. Because of inefficient communication between buyers and sellers, the incentives to build a reputation are weaker and the incentives to behave opportunistically are stronger. Developing countries are more likely to have “fly-by-night” traders and itinerant swindlers. For instance, in Nigeria there are many small retail outlets or vendor booths that rotate through a region’s local markets, selling shoddy electronic goods. Consumers often spend a large part of their household budgets on faulty electronic products that break down after a couple of weeks. These products are sold without warranties and consumers have no hope of receiving a refund. There are countless 4 Marcel Fafchamps and Bart Minten, “Relationships and Traders in Madagascar,” The Journal of Development Studies 35, no. 6 (1999): 1-35. 5 Kathryn Hendley, Peter Murrell, and Randi Ryterman, “Law, Relationships, and Private Enforcement: Transactional Strategies of Russian Enterprises,” Europe-Asia Studies 52, no. 4 (2000): 627-656.

Structural Change and Development Strategies Structural Change When some sectors in an economy expand while others shrink, we refer to this as structural change . In the context of economic development, the structural change we discuss in this chapter is the shift from a predominantly agricultural economy that relies on traditional farming methods, to a predominantly urban economy that relies on modern industrial technologies. This change is fundamental to the process of economic development as it results in high economic growth rates when workers leave behind less productive rural jobs to work for urban firms that are more productive. We saw how a low level of development is associated with a low level of urbanization and, conversely, a high level of development tends to be associated with a higher level of urbanization. When countries undergo structural change, they experience a reduction in agricultural employment and an increase in urban employment, whether in industry or services. In addition to the change from an agricultural to industrial economy, there are various other types of structural change relevant to development and growth, such as a transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, or an industrial structural change as certain industrial sectors expand and others contract. We will now take a closer look at each of these types of structural change. From an Agricultural to an Industrial Economy The most significant structural change is from a predominantly agricultural economy with low productivity, to a predominantly industrial economy with high productivity. Today’s advanced economies underwent this process between the 18th and 20th centuries, while many Asian economies, such as China, are going through it now. Figure 1 illustrates this shift in the Chinese agricultural labor force from 1978 to 2011. The share of the agricultural labor force, measured as the share of the agricultural population in the total population, declined from 75% to 60%. 1 If China continues to follow in the steps of other industrialized countries, agricultural workers will continue to leave rural areas and move into the urban job market. From an Industrial to a Service Economy Another type of structural change occurs with the transition from a predominantly industrial economy to one that is service-based. The service sector includes roughly all non-industrial urban sectors, such as banking, insurance, retail, education, health, entertainment, restaurants, and hotels. In the world’s most advanced economies, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, the change from a predominantly industrial economy to a service-based economy has only taken place in the last 5 decades. Developing countries are likely to make this shift as well and many may even take a shortcut. In recent years, India, with its large agricultural sector, 1 To be correct, this measure is based on the assumption that the share of the active population is the same in agriculture as outside agriculture. 


Structural Change and Development Strategies Why did export promotion in East Asia work? Export promotion has been the most popular strategy for development in the last 3 decades. Economists do not always agree on the reasons for its success, however. One interpretation, called the neoclassical explanation and favored by famous economists such as Jagdish Bhagwati and Anne Krueger, is that export promotion worked primarily because of its market-friendly philosophy: instead of protecting their industries, countries participated in trade liberalization and encouraged the production of exports for the world market. 14 While governments did intervene to encourage export promotion, their focus was on competition in world markets, not on policies that would distort domestic prices. Moreover, governments kept the macroeconomic fundamentals right, balanced their budgets, placed a strong emphasis on education to foster capital accumulation, maintained low inflation, and kept government intervention to a minimum. However, other economists emphasize the central role played by governments in coordinating investments between firms and in helping particular sectors and firms. They see such government intervention as beneficial in promoting growth. 15 Institutions and export promotion. Despite these controversies, given its success in practice, why has the strategy of export promotion not been implemented everywhere? Why have most countries in Latin America and Africa not implemented similar strategies that follow the Asian example? It seems that the most convincing answer lies in the varying strengths of institutions across countries. A developing country needs a government that is strong enough to be able to organize competition between firms, to set the rules for competition, and to uphold those rules. In other words, there has to be a skilled government bureaucracy in place that is able to understand all aspects of business projects, including technology, management, and marketing. Moreover, the government bureaucracy has to be strong enough to resist the pressure and influence exerted by firms that want to bend the rules in their favor. It is not surprising that the export promotion strategy has, for the most part, only worked in Asia, where countries tend to have strong governmental institutions and highly skilled people working in government administration. 14 Jagdish Bhagwati, “The Miracle That Did Happen: Understanding East Asia in Comparative Perspective,” in Taiwan’s Development Experience: Lessons on Role of Government and Markets, Eric Thorbecke and Henry Wan, eds.

For instance, in Nigeria there are many small retail outlets or vendor booths that rotate through a region’s local markets, selling shoddy electronic goods. Consumers often spend a large part of their household budgets on faulty electronic products that break down after a couple of weeks. These products are sold without warranties and consumers have no hope of receiving a refund. There are countless 4 Marcel Fafchamps and Bart Minten, “Relationships and Traders in Madagascar,” The Journal of Development Studies 35, no. 6 (1999): 1-35. 5 Kathryn Hendley, Peter Murrell, and Randi Ryterman, “Law, Relationships, and Private Enforcement: Transactional Strategies of Russian Enterprises,” Europe-Asia Studies 52, no. 4 (2000): 627-656.

Structural Change and Development Strategies Structural Change When some sectors in an economy expand while others shrink, we refer to this as structural change . In the context of economic development, the structural change we discuss in this chapter is the shift from a predominantly agricultural economy that relies on traditional farming methods, to a predominantly urban economy that relies on modern industrial technologies. This change is fundamental to the process of economic development as it results in high economic growth rates when workers leave behind less productive rural jobs to work for urban firms that are more productive. We saw how a low level of development is associated with a low level of urbanization and, conversely, a high level of development tends to be associated with a higher level of urbanization. When countries undergo structural change, they experience a reduction in agricultural employment and an increase in urban employment, whether in industry or services. In addition to the change from an agricultural to industrial economy, there are various other types of structural change relevant to development and growth, such as a transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, or an industrial structural change as certain industrial sectors expand and others contract. We will now take a closer look at each of these types of structural change. From an Agricultural to an Industrial Economy The most significant structural change is from a predominantly agricultural economy with low productivity, to a predominantly industrial economy with high productivity. Today’s advanced economies underwent this process between the 18th and 20th centuries, while many Asian economies, such as China, are going through it now. Figure 1 illustrates this shift in the Chinese agricultural labor force from 1978 to 2011. The share of the agricultural labor force, measured as the share of the agricultural population in the total population, declined from 75% to 60%. 1 If China continues to follow in the steps of other industrialized countries, agricultural workers will continue to leave rural areas and move into the urban job market. From an Industrial to a Service Economy Another type of structural change occurs with the transition from a predominantly industrial economy to one that is service-based. The service sector includes roughly all non-industrial urban sectors, such as banking, insurance, retail, education, health, entertainment, restaurants, and hotels. In the world’s most advanced economies, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, the change from a predominantly industrial economy to a service-based economy has only taken place in the last 5 decades. Developing countries are likely to make this shift as well and many may even take a shortcut. In recent years, India, with its large agricultural sector, 1 To be correct, this measure is based on the assumption that the share of the active population is the same in agriculture as outside agriculture. 


Institutions and Economic Development There are also coordination games with equilibria that are not all equally efficient. Imagine the very relevant situation in developing countries where people can either decide to be law-abiding citizens or to engage in illegal activities. They would choose to be law-abiding citizens if there were a significant chance that they would be caught in the commission of a crime, but would engage in illegal activities if there were a low chance of being apprehended. The police have limited resources to fight crime, so the probability of being caught depends on the number of people engaged in illegal activities. If few people break the law, then the probability of being caught is high and it is preferable to be honest, but if many break the law, the probability is lower and there are more incentives to engage in illegal activities. We have two equilibria: one in which people are honest under the rule of law and one in which people engage in illegal activities with no adequate law enforcement, and thus no rule of law. If the rule of law is a condition for productive investment to take place, which is crucial for growth, then the rule of law equilibrium will be better for citizens in the long run. Here again, an individual’s choice depends on the choice of others. Understanding coordination problems is important in the context of development for a variety of reasons. First, the social norms that have emerged in various countries are quite diverse. Norms of politeness vary greatly among countries and a lack of knowledge of these norms can easily lead to social misunderstandings. In some Asian countries, for example, entering a house or even a restaurant without taking off your shoes is extremely impolite. Norms of conversation in parts of East Africa require repeating what the previous speaker said before expressing one’s own opinion. Second, we can observe in many countries coordination on a suboptimal equilibrium with a low level of law abidance, high levels of tax evasion, a large informal sector, and a high level of acceptance for corruption. Reforms that help a country shift from one equilibrium to the other are very difficult to design and implement because they require a collective effort that, as seen above, can be difficult to achieve. Diagnosing the problem is often easier than finding an effective and practical solution. Coordination and “big push” strategies. If there is little infrastructure (ports, roads, or electricity), private investors will be reluctant to invest in a country because their investment will not be very productive without infrastructure. A government, in turn, will not want to spend money on infrastructure if it thinks that there will be little private investment. This results in a coordination equilibrium, where there is minimal infrastructure and minimal private investment. We can interpret the “big push” idea as an attempt to move from that low investment equilibrium to one in which there are high levels of both infrastructure and private investment. If there is a well-established infrastructure, private firms will be more willing to invest in the country and the government will be more willing to invest in the infrastructure if it thinks there will be significant private investment. The “big push” strategy consists of providing aid for infrastructure investment while simultaneously developing policies to encourage private investment.

Institutions and Economic Development The collective-action problem. Another important example of the prisoner’s dilemma is the collective-action problem , when people fail to undertake a collective action even though it is in their joint interest to do so. Imagine an Indian municipality’s decision to authorize the construction of a chemical factory that will pollute the town’s air and water, and suppose that the residents are opposed to the decision. To defeat the project, the population needs to be organized, but doing so is costly. Assume that if at least half the population shows up at a demonstration to protest the decision, the project will be abandoned. If, instead, less than half of the population shows up, the project will go forward. Demonstrating is costly and inconvenient, however, and much of the population would rather spend their free time elsewhere. Just as in the prisoner’s dilemma, if very few demonstrate, participation will not be effective and it will not be optimal for anyone to demonstrate. However, if at least half of the population goes to the demonstration, any resident can free ride and benefit from the Cooperation problems have always been present in human societies. One example is that of the tragedy of the commons. In English villages before the 16th century, parcels of land, called the commons, that belonged to a collection of individual farmers were accessible to the whole village. While all villagers could let their sheep graze on the commons, individual villagers had an incentive to let their sheep overgraze there without feeling responsible for the potential damage to the land. No matter what the other villagers decided to do, an individual’s maximum self-interest lay in letting his sheep graze as much as possible on the commons so that each villager would have to secure less feed for his sheep. Of course, this selfinterest led to serious overgrazing. In the 16th and 17th centuries, there was an “enclosure” movement launched by the British landed aristocracy to keep the commons away from those who did not have property claims, usually the poor peasants. This movement had major social effects on the English countryside and resulted in large numbers of peasants becoming severely impoverished and leaving their villages for the cities. We do not know exactly how much overgrazing there was in England at the time, but the tragedy of the commons is an illustration of a more general phenomenon that has occurred over and over in history, the overexploitation of arable land and the depletion of natural resources. The “fertile crescent” in the Middle East, around the Nile, Jordan, Tigris, and Euphrates rivers, was one of the most arable and productive areas of the ancient world. Overexploitation has eroded the quality of the soil and led to desertification. Similar problems have occurred in other regions due to deforestation; the population of Easter Island nearly became extinct following its complete exploitation of the island’s native tree species. 8 Deforestation of the Amazon rain forest in South America, the major producer of oxygen on the planet, is occurring at a phenomenal speed; the annual loss of rain forest in the Amazon region is roughly 10,000 square miles, nearly the size of Massachusetts. 8 See, for example, James A. Brander and M. Scott Taylor, “The Simple Economics of Easter Island: A Ricardo-Malthus Model of Renewable Resource Use,” The American Economic Review 88, no. 1 (March 1998): 119-138.

The Tragedy of the Commons 


Institutions and Economic Development The Cooperation Problem In a situation where individuals follow their self-interest in making their choices and where the outcomes of these choices are less than optimal for all parties, a cooperation problem arises. This means that if individuals cooperated to find a solution that would be better for all parties involved, they could achieve a better payoff. The prisoner’s dilemma. Economists represent the cooperation problem with the prisoner’s dilemma, an important example of game theory , which studies decisions of agents with payoffs that depend on the actions of other agents. In the prisoner’s dilemma , two suspects have been arrested by the police and are interrogated in the attempt to extract confessions to a joint crime. Each prisoner is in a separate cell and cannot communicate with the other. As Table 1 shows, if neither confesses, they will both serve a maximum of 6 months in jail. If they both confess, they will each serve 2 years. However, if one confesses and the other does not, the one who confesses will be set free immediately while the other will spend 10 years in jail. What will happen? Game theory tells us that the Nash equilibrium , a situation in which each agent has chosen an action that is optimal given the action of the other, is the scenario in which both confess. A Nash equilibrium also occurs when one player does not want to deviate from his or her actions given the actions of the other. Let us examine the strategies presented by the prisoner’s dilemma. Suppose B confesses. It is then in A’s best interest to confess also. If A does not confess, he will get 10 years, and if he does confess he will get 2 years. If B decides not to confess, it is again in A’s best interest to confess. Indeed, if A does not confess, he will get 6 months, but if he does confess, he walks free. We see that whether B decides to confess or not, it is always in A’s best interest to confess. This is called a dominant strategy , a situation in which the same action is optimal and independent of what the other player chooses. It is a dominant strategy for Prisoner A to confess. Since Prisoner B’s reasoning is the same as Prisoner A’s, Prisoner B will also decide to confess. Therefore, they will both serve 2 years. They would both be better off if they had decided not to confess. In that case, they would each only get 6 months. However, this is not a Nash equilibrium. Suppose that they each decided not to confess. In that case, each would gain individually by changing his mind and confessing in order to walk free. B stays silent. B confesses. A stays silent. Both serve 6 months. Prisoner A serves 10 years. Prisoner B goes free. A confesses. Prisoner A goes free. Prisoner B serves 10 years. Both serve 2 years. Prisoners A and B decide individually whether to confess to a crime. It would be in their joint interest for both to stay silent, but if they follow their self-interest, they will both choose to confess . .. and end up staying in jail longer.

They would both be better off if they had decided not to confess. In that case, they would each only get 6 months. However, this is not a Nash equilibrium. Suppose that they each decided not to confess. In that case, each would gain individually by changing his mind and confessing in order to walk free. B stays silent. B confesses. A stays silent. Both serve 6 months. Prisoner A serves 10 years. Prisoner B goes free. A confesses. Prisoner A goes free. Prisoner B serves 10 years. Both serve 2 years. Prisoners A and B decide individually whether to confess to a crime. It would be in their joint interest for both to stay silent, but if they follow their self-interest, they will both choose to confess . .. and end up staying in jail longer. TABLE 1 The Prisoner’s Dilemma 


Institutions and Economic Development Note that the commitment problem comes into play here. If both could precommit never to confess and were able to enforce such commitment, they would both be better off. However, if there is no mechanism to implement such precommitment, then it is in their self-interest to confess and the outcome is suboptimal. We can understand all cooperation problems in terms of the logical structure of the prisoner’s dilemma. The inefficiency of pure self-interest maximization. The prisoner’s dilemma is often called a cooperation problem because it is a typical representation of a scenario in which each agent follows only his or her self-interest and where the outcome is suboptimal for everyone. If cooperation could be enforced (in this case, a precommitment not to confess), then it would be better for both parties. The prisoner’s dilemma is often invoked as a symbol of the inefficiency of a pure laissez-faire system, in which individuals only follow their self-interest. This view is usually contrasted with traditional visions of laissez-faire, where following self-interest is best for society as a whole. There are many relevant examples of the cooperation problem, such as protecting the environment. It is costly for any single country to take measures to prevent climate change; reducing carbon dioxide emissions means introducing new car models that run on low-carbon or carbon-free fuels, investing in public transport, and developing energy-saving technologies. If all countries took these measures simultaneously, then they could achieve tangible results. However, countries also face the prisoner’s dilemma: if all other countries take measures to preserve the environment, then it is possible for a single country to benefit from the investment of the others without incurring the costs. 7 If all other countries decide not to invest in averting climate change, then it is not in the interest of a single country to incur the necessary costs because these investments will not yield benefits if other countries fail to reduce their carbon emissions. It is thus a dominant strategy not to invest in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. This lack of cooperation can be a tragedy in the long run. As most environmental issues reflect the prisoner’s dilemma, institutional solutions are needed to solve them. One such solution came in the form of the Kyoto Protocol , a modest first step toward international cooperation to prevent climate change. The Kyoto Protocol required 36 developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relative to their 1990 levels. This was considered by climatologists to be too modest a target. However, even that first step was far more than some countries were willing to take, and led by the Bush administration, the United States refused to sign the agreement. In December 2009, the United Nations’ Copenhagen Accord failed to reach an agreement with binding commitments by participating countries to reduce their carbon emissions. This failure illustrates the cooperation problem and the difficulties of finding solutions to complex problems when the parties involved follow their own self-interests. 7 This is not true for a very large country. The United States alone is responsible for about a third of carbon dioxide emissions in the world, so it would not benefit that much from free-riding on the environmental efforts of others since a U.S. failure to curb emissions would directly affect climate change, and thus hurt the U.S., too.

Institutions and Economic Development actions of the others while not incurring any of the costs of taking action. Thus, it is a dominant strategy for an individual not to demonstrate and the result is that no one demonstrates and the project is implemented, an outcome that is suboptimal for the residents. Everyone wants the demonstration to happen, but no one wants to participate individually, leading to collective-action failure. Collective-action failures are fundamental to understanding human societies. They help to explain why inefficient institutions persist in developing countries. We frequently read in the press of African dictators who loot their countries’ resources and put the proceeds, sometimes billions of dollars, in Swiss banks. Why do such situations continually occur? It is precisely because the collective-action problem prevents people from overthrowing corrupt leaders or dictatorial regimes. Institutional solutions to the cooperation problem. Institutions are necessary to solve cooperation problems. Historically, labor unions in many countries have helped workers organize collective actions in order to obtain better working conditions and higher wages. Professional organizations such as associations of farmers, fishermen, construction workers, and doctors defend the interests of their professions in both the legislative process and the media. Political parties serve as organizations that promote competing political platforms via the elections of party members and the passage of legislative bills. International institutions can also solve the cooperation problem. The United Nations (UN) was founded after World War II to prevent similar global conflicts from ever occurring again. Unfortunately, the UN was not given much power by the sovereign countries that make up its membership. This has prevented the organization from becoming an effective and powerful international institution able to intervene effectively in various world conflicts. The European Union (EU) is a more successful institution than the UN. European nations have been at war with each other for most of the last 1,000 years, but the creation of the EU was seen by Europeans as an institutional solution to cooperation problems in the region. Institutional solutions to the environmental problems of the planet will require new forms of international cooperation in which world leaders meet and jointly agree on solutions, and then commit to their implementation. Economists do not completely understand how the myriad associations and organizations that we observe in the world are able to overcome collectiveaction problems. People are not only organized into political parties, trade unions, and professional associations at the national level, but they also organize to cooperate at the international level. There are many small-scale examples of spontaneous collective action as well, such as villagers organizing to rebuild their homes after a fire or a flood. According to standard game theory, these associations and organizations should not emerge spontaneously because of the collective-action problem. It takes very dedicated individuals to incur the heavy cost of spending time and money to set up these cooperative efforts. The members of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) often feel passionately about the causes for which they fight, whether it is the environment, the eradication of poverty, or advancements in world health, in contrast to people who take a more passive approach to these problems and do not choose to spend time, energy, or money to organize and participate in new problemsolving associations.

International institutions can also solve the cooperation problem. The United Nations (UN) was founded after World War II to prevent similar global conflicts from ever occurring again. Unfortunately, the UN was not given much power by the sovereign countries that make up its membership. This has prevented the organization from becoming an effective and powerful international institution able to intervene effectively in various world conflicts. The European Union (EU) is a more successful institution than the UN. European nations have been at war with each other for most of the last 1,000 years, but the creation of the EU was seen by Europeans as an institutional solution to cooperation problems in the region. Institutional solutions to the environmental problems of the planet will require new forms of international cooperation in which world leaders meet and jointly agree on solutions, and then commit to their implementation. Economists do not completely understand how the myriad associations and organizations that we observe in the world are able to overcome collectiveaction problems. People are not only organized into political parties, trade unions, and professional associations at the national level, but they also organize to cooperate at the international level. There are many small-scale examples of spontaneous collective action as well, such as villagers organizing to rebuild their homes after a fire or a flood. According to standard game theory, these associations and organizations should not emerge spontaneously because of the collective-action problem. It takes very dedicated individuals to incur the heavy cost of spending time and money to set up these cooperative efforts. The members of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) often feel passionately about the causes for which they fight, whether it is the environment, the eradication of poverty, or advancements in world health, in contrast to people who take a more passive approach to these problems and do not choose to spend time, energy, or money to organize and participate in new problemsolving associations. 


Institutions and Economic Development actions of the others while not incurring any of the costs of taking action. Thus, it is a dominant strategy for an individual not to demonstrate and the result is that no one demonstrates and the project is implemented, an outcome that is suboptimal for the residents. Everyone wants the demonstration to happen, but no one wants to participate individually, leading to collective-action failure. Collective-action failures are fundamental to understanding human societies. They help to explain why inefficient institutions persist in developing countries. We frequently read in the press of African dictators who loot their countries’ resources and put the proceeds, sometimes billions of dollars, in Swiss banks. Why do such situations continually occur? It is precisely because the collective-action problem prevents people from overthrowing corrupt leaders or dictatorial regimes. Institutional solutions to the cooperation problem. Institutions are necessary to solve cooperation problems. Historically, labor unions in many countries have helped workers organize collective actions in order to obtain better working conditions and higher wages. Professional organizations such as associations of farmers, fishermen, construction workers, and doctors defend the interests of their professions in both the legislative process and the media.

Institutions and Economic Development similar examples of opportunistic sellers on markets in developing countries who contribute to consumers’ lack of trust and slow the development of reliable markets, putting poor countries at a double disadvantage. Not only are developing countries more likely to have weaker formal institutions, but the informal institution of reputation is less effective without the support of formal institutions and without good circulation of information. The Hold-Up Problem A widespread problem in business contracts, the hold-up problem , refers to a situation in which a business partnership requires an investment from one of the parties that is specific to the transaction in question. Once the investment has been made, however, the other partner “holds up” the party that made the investment in order to renegotiate the deal. For example, suppose a truck manufacturer in India agrees to subcontract the production of axles to another party. An investment of $10,000 is needed to produce the axles and it costs $20 to produce each axle, including the cost of capital. The truck manufacturer contracts an order of 1,000 axles and promises a price of $30 per axle. At that price, the transaction, based on the order of 1,000 axles, makes it possible for the axle subcontractor to break even, since he will be able to recover both the investment cost and the production costs. Indeed, the cost will be $10,000 + ($20 * 1,000) = 30,000 and sales will be $30,000. Once the axle company has made the investment in the machines to produce axles, however, the truck manufacturer tells the subcontractor that he is now ready to pay only $25 for an axle. What does the subcontractor do? He has the choice of either producing the axles at the lower price of $25 or not producing at all. If he does not produce, he loses $10,000, but if he goes ahead with production, he will only lose $ ,000 (his operating profit will be $25 * 1,000 ($20 * 1,000) $10,000 = $ ,000); as a result, the subcontractor will prefer to produce the axles. Because the investment cost is already sunk ( sunk cost ), the only thing that matters in deciding whether or not to produce the axles is the difference between sales ($25 * 1,000) and operating costs ($20 * 1,000), which is $ ,000. 6 Because the subcontractor will decide to produce, even though he will incur a loss, the truck manufacturer can take advantage of the subcontractor’s situation when proposing the lower price. The truck manufacturer is holding up the subcontractor, taking advantage of the subcontractor’s weaker bargaining position after he has made the investment. If the subcontractor had known the truck manufacturer was going to behave in this manner, then he would not have invested in the first place. A profitable investment opportunity can thus be lost because of the hold-up problem. In general, hold-up problems cause underinvestment, which is economically damaging in particular in developing countries. Hold-ups are not confined to specific industries. Suppose the representative of a food company convinced a farmer to change crops and produce cocoa, 6 Remember the notion of sunk cost. Once a cost has been incurred and cannot be recovered, it should not count in economic calculations of future choices. We apply this principle here.

Institutions and Economic Development demonstrations against the East German Communist regime in Leipzig. Within a few weeks, these demonstrations were joined by tens of thousands of East German citizens who had never before demonstrated. Two years previously, a similar uprising occurred, protesting the dictatorship in South Korea. The country had been living under various forms of dictatorship since the end of the Korean War. Student organizations began actively fighting for democracy and, in 1987, nationwide protests erupted, eventually leading to the downfall of the dictatorship. Large-scale riots are usually spontaneous and the result of some dramatic event such as a hike in food prices or the political assassination of an opposition leader. These forms of collective action are usually unpredictable and not well understood by social scientists. Because they are spontaneous and not backed by a formal organization, these collective actions are also fragile and their momentum is often difficult to sustain. Participants may demobilize very rapidly and the mass movement may die out without having achieved any precise goal. Sometimes, these mass movements are however more powerful and sustained than expected and lead to revolutionary change, like in the case of the Arab Spring. The Coordination Problem Game theorists define a coordination problem as a situation in which agents can all coordinate on a specific action and the action an individual chooses depends on what others do. There are multiple equilibria possible in coordination problems, different possible sets of actions on which individuals coordinate. Imagine a situation in which there are no motor vehicle statutes and individuals must decide on their own whether to drive on the right or on the left. All individuals would quickly unite to drive on one side or the other. However, we do not know on which side they would choose to drive. In terms of game theory, these choices are both Nash equilibria. If an individual sees everyone else driving on the right, he has an incentive to drive on the right as well, but if he sees all others driving on the left, he will have an equally strong incentive to drive on the left. Once everyone drives either on the left or on the right, no one will have an incentive to deviate because that would be dangerous. The only thing we can predict is that people will decide to adopt a single rule addressing on which side to drive. The difference between coordination and cooperation problems. The difference between these problems lies in the fact that in a coordination problem, what is optimal for an individual depends on what the others do. This is why there are multiple equilibria. There is no longer a dominant strategy as in the prisoner’s dilemma where there is only one possible equilibrium, the inefficient one. In the case of the driving rule, none of the two equilibria (everybody driving to the left or everybody driving to the right) seems better or worse than the other, assuming that steering wheel can be adjusted to the prevailing equilibrium. There are many coordination problems in which all equilibria give the same payoffs to agents. In some countries, when people decide to meet at the train station, the meeting place is below the main clock. In others, it is at the main exit, by the cab station or on the platform.

Institutions and Economic Development Note that the commitment problem comes into play here. If both could precommit never to confess and were able to enforce such commitment, they would both be better off. However, if there is no mechanism to implement such precommitment, then it is in their self-interest to confess and the outcome is suboptimal. We can understand all cooperation problems in terms of the logical structure of the prisoner’s dilemma. The inefficiency of pure self-interest maximization. The prisoner’s dilemma is often called a cooperation problem because it is a typical representation of a scenario in which each agent follows only his or her self-interest and where the outcome is suboptimal for everyone. If cooperation could be enforced (in this case, a precommitment not to confess), then it would be better for both parties. The prisoner’s dilemma is often invoked as a symbol of the inefficiency of a pure laissez-faire system, in which individuals only follow their self-interest. This view is usually contrasted with traditional visions of laissez-faire, where following self-interest is best for society as a whole. There are many relevant examples of the cooperation problem, such as protecting the environment. It is costly for any single country to take measures to prevent climate change; reducing carbon dioxide emissions means introducing new car models that run on low-carbon or carbon-free fuels, investing in public transport, and developing energy-saving technologies. If all countries took these measures simultaneously, then they could achieve tangible results. However, countries also face the prisoner’s dilemma: if all other countries take measures to preserve the environment, then it is possible for a single country to benefit from the investment of the others without incurring the costs. 7 If all other countries decide not to invest in averting climate change, then it is not in the interest of a single country to incur the necessary costs because these investments will not yield benefits if other countries fail to reduce their carbon emissions. It is thus a dominant strategy not to invest in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. This lack of cooperation can be a tragedy in the long run. As most environmental issues reflect the prisoner’s dilemma, institutional solutions are needed to solve them. One such solution came in the form of the Kyoto Protocol , a modest first step toward international cooperation to prevent climate change. The Kyoto Protocol required 36 developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relative to their 1990 levels. This was considered by climatologists to be too modest a target. However, even that first step was far more than some countries were willing to take, and led by the Bush administration, the United States refused to sign the agreement. In December 2009, the United Nations’ Copenhagen Accord failed to reach an agreement with binding commitments by participating countries to reduce their carbon emissions. This failure illustrates the cooperation problem and the difficulties of finding solutions to complex problems when the parties involved follow their own self-interests. 7 This is not true for a very large country. The United States alone is responsible for about a third of carbon dioxide emissions in the world, so it would not benefit that much from free-riding on the environmental efforts of others since a U.S. failure to curb emissions would directly affect climate change, and thus hurt the U.S., too.

Institutions and Economic Development also famous chain stores in developing countries—Marayana in Indonesia or Sanborns in Mexico. Brand-name chain stores sell hundreds of different types of products and unreliable merchandise could hurt their reputations. Chain stores are not only sales intermediaries between brand-name firms and consumers; they are also informational intermediaries because they gather information about the products they sell before offering them in their stores. Rating agencies also specialize in gathering information that is relevant for consumers or companies. Credit reporting companies, for example, gather information on borrowers and rate their creditworthiness. However, even in advanced market economies this reporting system is far from perfect. Larger credit rating agencies such as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch, which rate the creditworthiness of large firms and securities, were accused of serious inaccuracies in the years preceding the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. They were heavily criticized for giving good ratings to mortgage-backed securities based on subprime mortgages and for severely understating the risks associated with those securities. This huge failure in the financial sector has highlighted the need for more stringent regulation of credit-rating companies. Another example of a rating system is eBay’s transaction feedback. When eBay started to expand its online sales in the late 1990s, users reported many cases of fraud. Because of the risk consumers take when purchasing an item online, eBay devised a rating system in which buyers and sellers review a transaction after its completion. These ratings help members evaluate buyers’ and sellers’ reputations for good faith and honesty. It is not a coincidence that many of the examples of contractual solutions to informational problems are from advanced economies rather than developing economies. These solutions only work well with the support of efficiently functioning formal institutions. In a country where the legal system is inadequate, where law enforcement is inconsistent, and where the court system is inefficient or corrupt, warranties give less protection than they do in a country where there are strong legal institutions. A dishonest seller can use a warranty to attract customers but then break his promise to provide a quality product. If disgruntled customers cannot use the court system effectively to protect their rights, then warranties are meaningless. Informal solutions to informational problems. When formal institutions are deficient, which is most often the case in developing economies, informal institutions emerge to deal with informational asymmetries. If courts are not effective, repeated interactions and reputations are the main instruments buyers and sellers can rely on to overcome informational asymmetries. When informational asymmetries exist with no formal institutions to help overcome them, market competition becomes less effective even when there are many buyers and sellers. As a result, buyers and sellers will enter into long-term relationships with a network of trusted personal contacts. This is called relational contracting . Buyers will have fewer incentives to search for sellers offering lower prices or even to do business with them because the buyers will not know whether a product is of lower quality than what they can obtain from their usual suppliers. Similarly, sellers will not have the incentive to search for buyers who are willing to pay a higher price because they do not know whether alternative buyers will uphold their promise to pay.

Structural Change and Development Strategies The Lewis Model of Structural Change Arthur Lewis’s theory of structural change formed the basis of economic development research from the late 1950s until the 1980s. 2 He won the Nobel Prize in 1979 for his theory that addresses the question at the heart of the shift from a traditional, agricultural economy to a modern, industrial economy: how can we encourage structural change to achieve growth and development? Even though his theory was developed in the early 1950s, the structural change that has taken place in China since 1978 is probably one of the best illustrations of the Lewis model. Hundreds of millions of peasants have left the countryside to find jobs in the modern manufacturing sector. The nearly endless supply of labor has helped keep wages low, thereby leading to a booming manufacturing sector that has flooded the world with low-priced Chinese products. The Traditional and Modern Sectors In the Lewis model, there are two sectors in an economy: a traditional sector (agriculture) and a modern (industrial) sector. In the traditional agricultural sector, there are no new technologies and productivity is very low. The Lewis model states that in the traditional sector, the marginal product of labor is equal to zero up to a certain point. In other words, it is possible to withdraw a large amount of labor from the traditional agricultural sector without losing any output. Figure 2 illustrates the difference between production technology in the traditional and modern sectors. The production functions are shown as levels of output (agricultural or industrial), a function of labor working in the sector. The slope of such a production function indicates the marginal product of labor, i.e., the extra output that can be obtained by an extra unit of labor. Because the production function is concave, its decreasing slope means that the marginal product of labor is declining. Surplus of agricultural labor. Even though the production functions in the traditional and modern sectors are both concave, there are some key differences between them. The first difference is that the marginal product of labor in the agricultural sector is equal to zero beyond level L A * . For higher levels of agricultural labor, the slope of the production function is equal to zero. This means that adding more labor beyond level L A * does not lead to any increase in output. How can the marginal product of labor be equal to zero in traditional agriculture? It is a result of the huge surplus of labor in that sector. People have lived off the land for millennia. Because agriculture was the only source of subsistence and their main priority was survival, not efficiency, family members shared agricultural output.

Even though his theory was developed in the early 1950s, the structural change that has taken place in China since 1978 is probably one of the best illustrations of the Lewis model. Hundreds of millions of peasants have left the countryside to find jobs in the modern manufacturing sector. The nearly endless supply of labor has helped keep wages low, thereby leading to a booming manufacturing sector that has flooded the world with low-priced Chinese products. The Traditional and Modern Sectors In the Lewis model, there are two sectors in an economy: a traditional sector (agriculture) and a modern (industrial) sector. In the traditional agricultural sector, there are no new technologies and productivity is very low. The Lewis model states that in the traditional sector, the marginal product of labor is equal to zero up to a certain point. In other words, it is possible to withdraw a large amount of labor from the traditional agricultural sector without losing any output. Figure 2 illustrates the difference between production technology in the traditional and modern sectors. The production functions are shown as levels of output (agricultural or industrial), a function of labor working in the sector. The slope of such a production function indicates the marginal product of labor, i.e., the extra output that can be obtained by an extra unit of labor. Because the production function is concave, its decreasing slope means that the marginal product of labor is declining. Surplus of agricultural labor. Even though the production functions in the traditional and modern sectors are both concave, there are some key differences between them. The first difference is that the marginal product of labor in the agricultural sector is equal to zero beyond level L A * . For higher levels of agricultural labor, the slope of the production function is equal to zero. This means that adding more labor beyond level L A * does not lead to any increase in output. How can the marginal product of labor be equal to zero in traditional agriculture? It is a result of the huge surplus of labor in that sector. People have lived off the land for millennia. Because agriculture was the only source of subsistence and their main priority was survival, not efficiency, family members shared agricultural output.

Institutions and Economic Development demonstrations against the East German Communist regime in Leipzig. Within a few weeks, these demonstrations were joined by tens of thousands of East German citizens who had never before demonstrated. Two years previously, a similar uprising occurred, protesting the dictatorship in South Korea. The country had been living under various forms of dictatorship since the end of the Korean War. Student organizations began actively fighting for democracy and, in 1987, nationwide protests erupted, eventually leading to the downfall of the dictatorship. Large-scale riots are usually spontaneous and the result of some dramatic event such as a hike in food prices or the political assassination of an opposition leader. These forms of collective action are usually unpredictable and not well understood by social scientists. Because they are spontaneous and not backed by a formal organization, these collective actions are also fragile and their momentum is often difficult to sustain. Participants may demobilize very rapidly and the mass movement may die out without having achieved any precise goal. Sometimes, these mass movements are however more powerful and sustained than expected and lead to revolutionary change, like in the case of the Arab Spring. The Coordination Problem Game theorists define a coordination problem as a situation in which agents can all coordinate on a specific action and the action an individual chooses depends on what others do. There are multiple equilibria possible in coordination problems, different possible sets of actions on which individuals coordinate. Imagine a situation in which there are no motor vehicle statutes and individuals must decide on their own whether to drive on the right or on the left. All individuals would quickly unite to drive on one side or the other. However, we do not know on which side they would choose to drive. In terms of game theory, these choices are both Nash equilibria. If an individual sees everyone else driving on the right, he has an incentive to drive on the right as well, but if he sees all others driving on the left, he will have an equally strong incentive to drive on the left. Once everyone drives either on the left or on the right, no one will have an incentive to deviate because that would be dangerous. The only thing we can predict is that people will decide to adopt a single rule addressing on which side to drive. The difference between coordination and cooperation problems. The difference between these problems lies in the fact that in a coordination problem, what is optimal for an individual depends on what the others do. This is why there are multiple equilibria. There is no longer a dominant strategy as in the prisoner’s dilemma where there is only one possible equilibrium, the inefficient one. In the case of the driving rule, none of the two equilibria (everybody driving to the left or everybody driving to the right) seems better or worse than the other, assuming that steering wheel can be adjusted to the prevailing equilibrium. There are many coordination problems in which all equilibria give the same payoffs to agents. In some countries, when people decide to meet at the train station, the meeting place is below the main clock. In others, it is at the main exit, by the cab station or on the platform.

Institutions and Economic Development The weakness of formal institutions in developing economies tends to make the commitment problem more prevalent than in developed economies. Informal solutions to the commitment problem. In traditional societies, witnesses were usually present when promises were made between two parties in a trade agreement or other type of contract. Witnesses to a marriage commitment are an important institution in many societies throughout the world; today’s “best man” and “maid (or matron) of honor” are participating in an ancient tradition of witnessing a binding contract. Parties to agreements have often devised ingenious informal mechanisms to create credible commitments. This is the case in all spheres of life: trade, crime, and arms sales, as well as societal commitments such as marriage. For example, army generals have often signaled their commitment to fight on, regardless of the consequences, by burning bridges behind their troops so that the soldiers had nowhere to retreat. These actions have rarely failed to impress the enemy. In the business world, a company might undertake a very large investment that can only be recouped if the product becomes the “next great thing” with booming sales. The company undertakes the investment to show its commitment to challenge other market competitors. On a darker note, in Japan many businesses hire the yakuza , organized crime syndicates, as debt collection agencies. Yakuza agents who threaten a recalcitrant debtor will go so far as to cut off their own finger in front of the debtor to emphasize their commitment to recovering the debt. Because formal contract enforcement is so important in solving commitment problems, developing countries with deficient formal law enforcement must often use informal enforcement agencies. As is the case with hold-up problems, informal institutions are much less effective than formal ones when it comes to solving the commitment problem. Informal enforcement methods were widespread in Russia during the 1990s, when the country started its transition to a market economy, and they often involved criminal organizations or firms that had close links to organized crime. These connections were efficient at using the threat of violence to enforce commitments made by private agents in a variety of contractual situations. Obviously, there was a downside to the use of criminal organizations as enforcement agencies: their methods turned quickly into abuse as contracting parties increasingly turned to the threat of violence as a means to renegotiate agreements. The criminal agencies engaged in racketeering by extorting money or favors from the firms that had hired them in the first place. Competition among criminal agencies led to a deepening spiral of violence and terror. When formal institutions in developing nations cannot enforce both criminal and civil laws, businesses may be forced to use criminal agencies to protect themselves and their business interests.

Institutions and Economic Development promise to pay for the bicycle before its delivery, but it may no longer be optimal to pay once the delivery has occurred, especially if the buyer can renege with no consequences. Consequences of the lack of commitment. The inability to commit hurts both parties in a transaction and is, in many cases, an impediment to transactions. There are also situations in which one party’s inability to commit weakens its bargaining power and renders its threats not credible to the other party. For example, a government could commit to a non-negotiation policy with terrorists or pirates who take hostages, but might be unable to resist the pressure to negotiate once such a hostage situation occurs. This wavering of resolve weakens the government’s bargaining power and invites further hostagetaking actions. Credibility , a party’s ability to uphold the commitments it makes, plays an important role in monetary and fiscal policy. A government might promise not to run fiscal deficits, but before an election, it could abandon that commitment by raising expenditures to garner votes. Lack of credibility in this case means that agents will expect fiscal deficits and behave accordingly. In particular, a central bank may want to announce a tight monetary policy, but may later engage in unexpected monetary expansion to stimulate the economy. The central bank’s lack of credibility will lead agents to expect inflation to be higher than the targets announced by the central bank. A monopoly may be unable to commit to maintain current prices once it has sold to the customers with the highest willingness to pay, as has often been the case with new types of computers, DVD players, and with flat-screen TVs. Initially, these televisions were quite expensive and many consumers preferred to wait for the price to fall, secure in their knowledge that the manufacturers would drop their prices as soon as demand declined, regardless of announcements made to the contrary. In this case, if the monopoly could make credible commitments not to lower prices, consumers would not wait for the price to fall before making a purchase. Institutional solutions to the commitment problem. When formal institutions are reliable, contract enforcement plays a crucial role in solving commitment problems. The parties draw up a contract that makes commitment legally binding and possibly provides specific penalties for breach of contract. If one party reneges on a commitment, the other can go to court to punish the guilty party. This “third-party enforcement” serves as a powerful instrument to solve commitment problems. Legally enforceable contracts thus help to “tie one’s hands,” which is usually beneficial for both parties. Solving the commitment problem by legally binding contracts does not necessarily imply rigidity. A contract may specify actions that are no longer optimal for both parties. For example, two companies may have a delivery contract for a certain good over a certain period of time. If the producer comes up with a new product that is both less costly to produce and gives more utility to the buyer, the two parties can agree to void the existing contract or to draw up a new agreement. However, the existing contract still protects each party to the contract. If the two agree to void a contract, it must indeed be the case that both are made better off, and no one suffers from the decision.

Institutions and Economic Development agricultural markets, the largest trading firms always do business with the same suppliers and customers. 4 Having a large number of these time-tested relationships is seen by the traders as the biggest determinant of success in business. These business contacts are not only used to exchange information, but also to share risks and to borrow or lend money when necessary. In the 1990s, during the turbulent period of transition in Russia’s market economy, legal institutions were very weak; as a result, firms developed repeated business relationships with a fixed set of suppliers and clients and were reluctant to enter into new business relationships. 5 In a situation of relational contracting, breach of trust can be fatal to the relationship. If a partner deviates from honest behavior, his or her counterpart could end the relationship immediately, forcing the now-unreliable partner to face the uncertainty of the market environment. Because the prospect of finding another reliable trading partner in the market is fraught with informational asymmetries, the threat of terminating the relationship can serve as a deterrent to opportunistic behavior. Less competition for new partners, and buyers and sellers stuck in unprofitable relationships creates an environment that will hinder market growth. The expansion of markets is stronger when formal institutions work to enforce contractual solutions to informational asymmetries. Reputation also plays a role when formal institutions are deficient. Economic agents who build a reputation of honesty, reliability, and efficiency will benefit because their reputations will make them desirable business partners. Reputable buyers and sellers have fewer incentives to indulge in opportunistic behavior due to the significant investments of time and effort necessary to acquire their good reputations. However, in order for reputations to be effective when formal institutions are deficient, there has to be an adequate and efficient circulation of information. Without this movement, information about reputations does not move through the marketplace. In the modern world, communicating this information is easy because it is available instantaneously on the Internet, whether through e-mail, blogs, or social media. Unfortunately, poor countries are at a disadvantage because information technology is not well developed in them. In many of these countries, the primary means of disseminating information is still by word of mouth. Because of inefficient communication between buyers and sellers, the incentives to build a reputation are weaker and the incentives to behave opportunistically are stronger. Developing countries are more likely to have “fly-by-night” traders and itinerant swindlers. For instance, in Nigeria there are many small retail outlets or vendor booths that rotate through a region’s local markets, selling shoddy electronic goods. Consumers often spend a large part of their household budgets on faulty electronic products that break down after a couple of weeks. These products are sold without warranties and consumers have no hope of receiving a refund. There are countless 4 Marcel Fafchamps and Bart Minten, “Relationships and Traders in Madagascar,” The Journal of Development Studies 35, no. 6 (1999): 1-35. 5 Kathryn Hendley, Peter Murrell, and Randi Ryterman, “Law, Relationships, and Private Enforcement: Transactional Strategies of Russian Enterprises,” Europe-Asia Studies 52, no. 4 (2000): 627-656.

These connections were efficient at using the threat of violence to enforce commitments made by private agents in a variety of contractual situations. Obviously, there was a downside to the use of criminal organizations as enforcement agencies: their methods turned quickly into abuse as contracting parties increasingly turned to the threat of violence as a means to renegotiate agreements. The criminal agencies engaged in racketeering by extorting money or favors from the firms that had hired them in the first place. Competition among criminal agencies led to a deepening spiral of violence and terror. When formal institutions in developing nations cannot enforce both criminal and civil laws, businesses may be forced to use criminal agencies to protect themselves and their business interests. The Russian Mob in a Market Economy 


Institutions and Economic Development similar examples of opportunistic sellers on markets in developing countries who contribute to consumers’ lack of trust and slow the development of reliable markets, putting poor countries at a double disadvantage. Not only are developing countries more likely to have weaker formal institutions, but the informal institution of reputation is less effective without the support of formal institutions and without good circulation of information. The Hold-Up Problem A widespread problem in business contracts, the hold-up problem , refers to a situation in which a business partnership requires an investment from one of the parties that is specific to the transaction in question. Once the investment has been made, however, the other partner “holds up” the party that made the investment in order to renegotiate the deal. For example, suppose a truck manufacturer in India agrees to subcontract the production of axles to another party. An investment of $10,000 is needed to produce the axles and it costs $20 to produce each axle, including the cost of capital. The truck manufacturer contracts an order of 1,000 axles and promises a price of $30 per axle. At that price, the transaction, based on the order of 1,000 axles, makes it possible for the axle subcontractor to break even, since he will be able to recover both the investment cost and the production costs. Indeed, the cost will be $10,000 + ($20 * 1,000) = 30,000 and sales will be $30,000. Once the axle company has made the investment in the machines to produce axles, however, the truck manufacturer tells the subcontractor that he is now ready to pay only $25 for an axle. What does the subcontractor do? He has the choice of either producing the axles at the lower price of $25 or not producing at all. If he does not produce, he loses $10,000, but if he goes ahead with production, he will only lose $ ,000 (his operating profit will be $25 * 1,000 ($20 * 1,000) $10,000 = $ ,000); as a result, the subcontractor will prefer to produce the axles. Because the investment cost is already sunk ( sunk cost ), the only thing that matters in deciding whether or not to produce the axles is the difference between sales ($25 * 1,000) and operating costs ($20 * 1,000), which is $ ,000. 6 Because the subcontractor will decide to produce, even though he will incur a loss, the truck manufacturer can take advantage of the subcontractor’s situation when proposing the lower price. The truck manufacturer is holding up the subcontractor, taking advantage of the subcontractor’s weaker bargaining position after he has made the investment. If the subcontractor had known the truck manufacturer was going to behave in this manner, then he would not have invested in the first place. A profitable investment opportunity can thus be lost because of the hold-up problem. In general, hold-up problems cause underinvestment, which is economically damaging in particular in developing countries. Hold-ups are not confined to specific industries. Suppose the representative of a food company convinced a farmer to change crops and produce cocoa, 6 Remember the notion of sunk cost. Once a cost has been incurred and cannot be recovered, it should not count in economic calculations of future choices. We apply this principle here. 


Institutions and Economic Development There are also coordination games with equilibria that are not all equally efficient. Imagine the very relevant situation in developing countries where people can either decide to be law-abiding citizens or to engage in illegal activities. They would choose to be law-abiding citizens if there were a significant chance that they would be caught in the commission of a crime, but would engage in illegal activities if there were a low chance of being apprehended. The police have limited resources to fight crime, so the probability of being caught depends on the number of people engaged in illegal activities. If few people break the law, then the probability of being caught is high and it is preferable to be honest, but if many break the law, the probability is lower and there are more incentives to engage in illegal activities. We have two equilibria: one in which people are honest under the rule of law and one in which people engage in illegal activities with no adequate law enforcement, and thus no rule of law. If the rule of law is a condition for productive investment to take place, which is crucial for growth, then the rule of law equilibrium will be better for citizens in the long run. Here again, an individual’s choice depends on the choice of others. Understanding coordination problems is important in the context of development for a variety of reasons. First, the social norms that have emerged in various countries are quite diverse. Norms of politeness vary greatly among countries and a lack of knowledge of these norms can easily lead to social misunderstandings. In some Asian countries, for example, entering a house or even a restaurant without taking off your shoes is extremely impolite. Norms of conversation in parts of East Africa require repeating what the previous speaker said before expressing one’s own opinion. Second, we can observe in many countries coordination on a suboptimal equilibrium with a low level of law abidance, high levels of tax evasion, a large informal sector, and a high level of acceptance for corruption. Reforms that help a country shift from one equilibrium to the other are very difficult to design and implement because they require a collective effort that, as seen above, can be difficult to achieve. Diagnosing the problem is often easier than finding an effective and practical solution. Coordination and “big push” strategies. If there is little infrastructure (ports, roads, or electricity), private investors will be reluctant to invest in a country because their investment will not be very productive without infrastructure. A government, in turn, will not want to spend money on infrastructure if it thinks that there will be little private investment. This results in a coordination equilibrium, where there is minimal infrastructure and minimal private investment. We can interpret the “big push” idea as an attempt to move from that low investment equilibrium to one in which there are high levels of both infrastructure and private investment. If there is a well-established infrastructure, private firms will be more willing to invest in the country and the government will be more willing to invest in the infrastructure if it thinks there will be significant private investment. The “big push” strategy consists of providing aid for infrastructure investment while simultaneously developing policies to encourage private investment.

Institutions and Economic Development also famous chain stores in developing countries—Marayana in Indonesia or Sanborns in Mexico. Brand-name chain stores sell hundreds of different types of products and unreliable merchandise could hurt their reputations. Chain stores are not only sales intermediaries between brand-name firms and consumers; they are also informational intermediaries because they gather information about the products they sell before offering them in their stores. Rating agencies also specialize in gathering information that is relevant for consumers or companies. Credit reporting companies, for example, gather information on borrowers and rate their creditworthiness. However, even in advanced market economies this reporting system is far from perfect. Larger credit rating agencies such as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch, which rate the creditworthiness of large firms and securities, were accused of serious inaccuracies in the years preceding the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. They were heavily criticized for giving good ratings to mortgage-backed securities based on subprime mortgages and for severely understating the risks associated with those securities. This huge failure in the financial sector has highlighted the need for more stringent regulation of credit-rating companies. Another example of a rating system is eBay’s transaction feedback. When eBay started to expand its online sales in the late 1990s, users reported many cases of fraud. Because of the risk consumers take when purchasing an item online, eBay devised a rating system in which buyers and sellers review a transaction after its completion. These ratings help members evaluate buyers’ and sellers’ reputations for good faith and honesty. It is not a coincidence that many of the examples of contractual solutions to informational problems are from advanced economies rather than developing economies. These solutions only work well with the support of efficiently functioning formal institutions. In a country where the legal system is inadequate, where law enforcement is inconsistent, and where the court system is inefficient or corrupt, warranties give less protection than they do in a country where there are strong legal institutions. A dishonest seller can use a warranty to attract customers but then break his promise to provide a quality product. If disgruntled customers cannot use the court system effectively to protect their rights, then warranties are meaningless. Informal solutions to informational problems. When formal institutions are deficient, which is most often the case in developing economies, informal institutions emerge to deal with informational asymmetries. If courts are not effective, repeated interactions and reputations are the main instruments buyers and sellers can rely on to overcome informational asymmetries. When informational asymmetries exist with no formal institutions to help overcome them, market competition becomes less effective even when there are many buyers and sellers. As a result, buyers and sellers will enter into long-term relationships with a network of trusted personal contacts. This is called relational contracting . Buyers will have fewer incentives to search for sellers offering lower prices or even to do business with them because the buyers will not know whether a product is of lower quality than what they can obtain from their usual suppliers. Similarly, sellers will not have the incentive to search for buyers who are willing to pay a higher price because they do not know whether alternative buyers will uphold their promise to pay. For example, in Madagascar’s

Institutions and Economic Development The Cooperation Problem In a situation where individuals follow their self-interest in making their choices and where the outcomes of these choices are less than optimal for all parties, a cooperation problem arises. This means that if individuals cooperated to find a solution that would be better for all parties involved, they could achieve a better payoff. The prisoner’s dilemma. Economists represent the cooperation problem with the prisoner’s dilemma, an important example of game theory , which studies decisions of agents with payoffs that depend on the actions of other agents. In the prisoner’s dilemma , two suspects have been arrested by the police and are interrogated in the attempt to extract confessions to a joint crime. Each prisoner is in a separate cell and cannot communicate with the other. As Table 1 shows, if neither confesses, they will both serve a maximum of 6 months in jail. If they both confess, they will each serve 2 years. However, if one confesses and the other does not, the one who confesses will be set free immediately while the other will spend 10 years in jail. What will happen? Game theory tells us that the Nash equilibrium , a situation in which each agent has chosen an action that is optimal given the action of the other, is the scenario in which both confess. A Nash equilibrium also occurs when one player does not want to deviate from his or her actions given the actions of the other. Let us examine the strategies presented by the prisoner’s dilemma. Suppose B confesses. It is then in A’s best interest to confess also. If A does not confess, he will get 10 years, and if he does confess he will get 2 years. If B decides not to confess, it is again in A’s best interest to confess. Indeed, if A does not confess, he will get 6 months, but if he does confess, he walks free. We see that whether B decides to confess or not, it is always in A’s best interest to confess. This is called a dominant strategy , a situation in which the same action is optimal and independent of what the other player chooses. It is a dominant strategy for Prisoner A to confess. Since Prisoner B’s reasoning is the same as Prisoner A’s, Prisoner B will also decide to confess. Therefore, they will both serve 2 years. They would both be better off if they had decided not to confess. In that case, they would each only get 6 months. However, this is not a Nash equilibrium. Suppose that they each decided not to confess. In that case, each would gain individually by changing his mind and confessing in order to walk free. B stays silent. B confesses. A stays silent. Both serve 6 months. Prisoner A serves 10 years. Prisoner B goes free. A confesses. Prisoner A goes free. Prisoner B serves 10 years. Both serve 2 years. Prisoners A and B decide individually whether to confess to a crime. It would be in their joint interest for both to stay silent, but if they follow their self-interest, they will both choose to confess . .. and end up staying in jail longer. TABLE 1 The Prisoner’s Dilemma 


Political Institutions Political Institutions in a Democracy When comparing democracies, the two principal features to analyze are political regimes and electoral rules. Political regimes vary in how the different branches of government function and interact. Electoral rules differ in how the executive and legislators are elected. Presidential and Parliamentary Democracies The two main types of democratic regimes are presidential and parliamentary systems. In a presidential regime , the president, who heads the executive branch, is usually directly elected by voters. In a parliamentary regime , the executive branch is appointed by a parliamentary majority. In a presidential regime, the executive branch derives its power from a source independent of the legislative branch, the electorate. In a parliamentary system, it is the opposite: the legislative branch of government decides on who will head the executive branch. In a presidential system, the legislative branch does not have the power to dismiss the executive for political reasons. Procedures to impeach the president are rarely initiated and only in case of gross ethical misconduct, not because of political disagreement. In a parliamentary regime, by contrast, the legislative branch can routinely vote down an executive for political reasons through a vote of no confidence. This is the case, for example, if a coalition party decides to leave the majority, provoking a government crisis. The three major branches of government in a democracy are: •± The executive branch, responsible for the day-today operation of government and the execution of the laws passed by its legislative branch. The executive controls the military and the national police force as well as various ministries and government agencies. It has very limited powers in terms of enacting laws, and the extent of its powers is constrained by constitutional law. The head of the executive branch is usually directly elected by universal suffrage in a presidential democracy, or by the legislative branch in a parliamentary democracy. •± The legislative branch, directly elected by citizens, is responsible for making laws. It has no executive powers and limited investigative powers. •± The judicial branch is composed of professional career judges and is usually not elected. Its role is to interpret and uphold the laws passed by the legislative branch, to ensure that those accused of a crime have a fair trial, and to punish those who are convicted of violating the law. The advantage of separation of powers is that the executive cannot enact laws on its own, which could result in an increase in, and abuse of, its powers. Similarly, executive actions must comply with the rule of the law as laid out in the constitution, and the judicial branch is empowered to punish any deviation from the law by the executive or the legislative branch. Because legislators are democratically elected, the laws they enact usually express the interests of a majority of the population. Separation of Powers in a Democracy 


Institutions and Economic Development cooked quickly when exposed to microwaves. Thus, there can be a significant difference between the original purpose of an invention and its ultimate practical function, which in the case of the microwave, was quite accidental. This is also the case for many inventions such as silicon, saccharin, and the cardiac pacemaker among many others. A similar process has occurred for many institutions. Settlers who came to North America or Australia did not have in mind the goal of creating institutions for successful economic development. They were primarily focused on preventing the creation of a monarchy such as the one they had left in England. Freedom from tyranny was their objective. They had no idea that the institutions they created would lead to phenomenal economic success. This discussion illustrates the idea that function does not constitute an explanation for existence. There is the danger of the functionalist fallacy , which mistakes an object’s function for the cause of its existence. Why is this distinction important? If we did not pay attention to this problem, we would tend to adhere to the view that institutions are always efficient. Indeed, if institutions solve certain problems, we would tend to believe that once a problem emerges, an institution will automatically appear to solve it. If this were the case, institutions would always be efficient. In fact, many institutions are typically inefficient, and inefficient institutions can persist for a very long time. Bringing about change to institutions requires overcoming the collective-action problem. This is very difficult to do in developing countries, especially if democratic institutions are absent or imperfect. Corruption is rife in many developing economies, with inefficient courts, dictatorial regimes, little protection for property rights, and a lack of formal titling systems. Inefficient formal institutions are very hard to overcome, especially when they aim to prevent agents from organizing to change them. Until considerable individual courage and group mobilization can overcome inefficient institutions, they may persist for a very long time. The expansion of institutionalism that has taken place in economic theory is a revival of sorts. Economists developed contract theory and principal agent theory to analyze problems with individual transactions between agents who are in a contractual relationship. Game theory provides the tools to consider such problems analytically. Nevertheless, before game theory was developed, many economists already took institutions very seriously even though they were not part of mainstream theory. Throughout the 20th century, quite a few famous economists tried to understand the role of institutions and how they develop. We mention some of these prominent economists below. Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929), in a famous book called The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), coined the concept of conspicuous consumption , explaining that consumption among the rich was dictated more by a desire to show one’s wealth and status rather than by the useful characteristics of the good consumed. He also believed that Leaders in Institutionalism ( Continued )

Institutions and Economic Development policies, or the emergence of informational intermediaries such as rating agencies and chain stores. Informal institutional solutions to informational problems involve the reputation of economic agents and the circulation of information about their reputations. Commitment problems arise when a party in a transaction has an incentive to renege on a promise made to the other party. Formal institutions solve the commitment problem by enforcing legal contracts. Informal enforcement of commitments is more difficult and sometimes requires the use of criminal organizations. Cooperation problems arise because agents must incur individual costs when participating in any form of joint action, but can benefit from the effort of others even when they do not participate in the action. As a result, collective action occurs less often than is necessary. Formal institutional solutions to collective action include political and civil associations. Democracy is an important solution to collective action by means of elections, which allow voters to make collective choices for leaders and policies. Informal solutions include riots, spontaneous strikes, and other actions that occur in special circumstances. Coordination problems arise when the actions of some agents affect the actions of others and when agents coordinate on positive behaviors (behaving honestly, trusting others, paying taxes) or negative behaviors (behaving dishonestly, not trusting others, evading taxes). Formal solutions to coordination problems involve laws and standards; informal solutions involve social norms and conventions. The Persistence of Inefficient Institutions Inefficient institutions have negative long-term effects on the economy.

Informational intermediaries Economic agents such as chain stores or other firms that gather information about the products they sell before offering them for sale in their stores. Institution A constraint placed by law and/or social norms on human behavior. Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, required 36 developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relative to their 1990 levels. Moral hazard Possibility of unobservable actions that one of the contracting parties (the agent) can take that will hurt the interest of the other contracting party (the principal). Multiple equilibria Situation with multiple Nash equilibria that is present in coordination problems. Nash equilibrium Outcome in a game-theoretic situation in which each agent has chosen an action that is optimal given the action of the other agent. In other words, no player wants to deviate from his or her actions given the actions of the other.

Rating agencies Agencies that rate the quality of firms, lenders, or borrowers. Regulation of access or entry Rules that govern entry into and the practice of a profession, and require a candidate to earn a qualified diploma or pass an exam as a means to screen out unqualified people. Relational contracting Describes a situation in which institutions are weak and firms tend not to trust businesses they do not know well, preferring to maintain trusted business relationships. Relationship specific Describes a situation in which an investment only has value in the context of a specific partnership with another firm. Return policies Policies that allow a buyer to bring purchased goods back to the seller within a specified time after their purchase. Risk averse Describes the risk preferences of an individual who puts less weight on the upside payoff than on the downside payoff for given probabilities. Risk neutral Describes the risk preferences of an individual who values upside and downside payoffs equally and weighs them according to their probability. Sequential transactions Transactions that do not take place at the same time but rather in a certain order. Signaling An economic term that means taking certain actions to provide other parties in a transaction with credible information. Social norms (conventions) Norms of behavior that are expected from individuals and to which they are supposed to conform. Social norms are enforced through peer pressure. Time inconsistency Circumstance that occurs when the optimal choice for one of the contracting parties at one point in time is no longer optimal at a later stage.

Prisoner’s dilemma A situation in which two suspects have been arrested by the police and are interrogated in an attempt to extract confessions to a joint crime. Each prisoner is in a separate cell and cannot communicate with the other. They face a cooperation problem and each prefers to confess individually whereas they would both be better off if neither confessed. Rating agencies Agencies that rate the quality of firms, lenders, or borrowers. Regulation of access or entry Rules that govern entry into and the practice of a profession, and require a candidate to earn a qualified diploma or pass an exam as a means to screen out unqualified people. Relational contracting Describes a situation in which institutions are weak and firms tend not to trust businesses they do not know well, preferring to maintain trusted business relationships. Relationship specific Describes a situation in which an investment only has value in the context of a specific partnership with another firm. Return policies Policies that allow a buyer to bring purchased goods back to the seller within a specified time after their purchase. Risk averse Describes the risk preferences of an individual who puts less weight on the upside payoff than on the downside payoff for given probabilities. Risk neutral Describes the risk preferences of an individual who values upside and downside payoffs equally and weighs them according to their probability. Sequential transactions Transactions that do not take place at the same time but rather in a certain order. Signaling An economic term that means taking certain actions to provide other parties in a transaction with credible information. Social norms (conventions) Norms of behavior that are expected from individuals and to which they are supposed to conform. Social norms are enforced through peer pressure. Time inconsistency Circumstance that occurs when the optimal choice for one of the contracting parties at one point in time is no longer optimal at a later stage. 


Political Institutions Political Institutions in a Democracy When comparing democracies, the two principal features to analyze are political regimes and electoral rules. Political regimes vary in how the different branches of government function and interact. Electoral rules differ in how the executive and legislators are elected. Presidential and Parliamentary Democracies The two main types of democratic regimes are presidential and parliamentary systems. In a presidential regime , the president, who heads the executive branch, is usually directly elected by voters. In a parliamentary regime , the executive branch is appointed by a parliamentary majority. In a presidential regime, the executive branch derives its power from a source independent of the legislative branch, the electorate. In a parliamentary system, it is the opposite: the legislative branch of government decides on who will head the executive branch. In a presidential system, the legislative branch does not have the power to dismiss the executive for political reasons. Procedures to impeach the president are rarely initiated and only in case of gross ethical misconduct, not because of political disagreement. In a parliamentary regime, by contrast, the legislative branch can routinely vote down an executive for political reasons through a vote of no confidence. This is the case, for example, if a coalition party decides to leave the majority, provoking a government crisis. The three major branches of government in a democracy are: •± The executive branch, responsible for the day-today operation of government and the execution of the laws passed by its legislative branch. The executive controls the military and the national police force as well as various ministries and government agencies. It has very limited powers in terms of enacting laws, and the extent of its powers is constrained by constitutional law. The head of the executive branch is usually directly elected by universal suffrage in a presidential democracy, or by the legislative branch in a parliamentary democracy. •± The legislative branch, directly elected by citizens, is responsible for making laws. It has no executive powers and limited investigative powers. •± The judicial branch is composed of professional career judges and is usually not elected. Its role is to interpret and uphold the laws passed by the legislative branch, to ensure that those accused of a crime have a fair trial, and to punish those who are convicted of violating the law. The advantage of separation of powers is that the executive cannot enact laws on its own, which could result in an increase in, and abuse of, its powers. Similarly, executive actions must comply with the rule of the law as laid out in the constitution, and the judicial branch is empowered to punish any deviation from the law by the executive or the legislative branch. Because legislators are democratically elected, the laws they enact usually express the interests of a majority of the population. Separation of Powers in a Democracy 


Political Institutions of economies of scale in the provision of public services. After secession, the government in the newly seceded state will provide services on a smaller scale and economies of scale may be lost, making the provision of those services more costly. Loss of economies of scale may not be important in the case of a seceding region with a language different from that of the official language of the united country. Indeed, countries with multiple official languages need to face the difficulties of administering the provision of public services using several languages. A final difference between a democracy and an autocracy is commitment. We saw that institutions solve a variety of commitment issues. The problem of commitment between government and private citizens is more difficult to solve than the commitment problem between private parties. In the latter case, commitment is obtained by enforcing contracts, and the legal system acts as the third party enforcing the contract. If the government is one of the contracting parties, however, it faces a commitment problem because there is no third party that can enforce commitment between a government and its citizens. The reason is that the government has a monopoly over violence, making it non-credible for any third party to threaten the government if it reneges on its commitments. Autocracies usually lack any commitment obligation to honor promises made to their citizens—for example, to not expropriate the property of private investors. The only way to obtain commitment in an autocracy is by reputation. If a dictator manages to establish a reputation for being strongly pro-business, that reputation can act as a long-term commitment device for repeated interactions between the government and the private sector. A good example would be Singapore, which has scored very well on indicators of the rule of law and protection of property rights even though it has a nondemocratic government. In a democracy, the principles of the rule of law and the separation of powers between the different branches of government help to mitigate the commitment problem. Most democratic countries have constitutions that include a bill of rights for citizens as well as established rules for the functioning of government. Constitutional guarantees protect citizens from a government encroaching on their rights and abusing its power. Constitutional articles describe the extent and limits of the powers of different branches of government. Constitutionally established courts uphold citizens’ rights and the executive branch is obligated to yield to the courts’ decisions. This represents a commitment device because the executive branch, which controls the potentially repressive apparatus of government, is bound by the constitution and the limits it imposes on government powers. Constitutions are usually very difficult to change; amending a constitution typically requires supermajorities, often two-thirds or more of a legislature’s votes. The requirement of a supermajority to amend a constitution also serves as a commitment device because it makes it impossible for the executive branch to abuse its powers through a constitutional change approved by just a simple legislative majority. The supermajority guarantees a near consensus among democratically elected representatives on the proposed constitutional amendments, which means that the changes are seen as benefiting nearly all represented interests.

Institutions and Economic Development policies, or the emergence of informational intermediaries such as rating agencies and chain stores. Informal institutional solutions to informational problems involve the reputation of economic agents and the circulation of information about their reputations. Commitment problems arise when a party in a transaction has an incentive to renege on a promise made to the other party. Formal institutions solve the commitment problem by enforcing legal contracts. Informal enforcement of commitments is more difficult and sometimes requires the use of criminal organizations. Cooperation problems arise because agents must incur individual costs when participating in any form of joint action, but can benefit from the effort of others even when they do not participate in the action. As a result, collective action occurs less often than is necessary. Formal institutional solutions to collective action include political and civil associations. Democracy is an important solution to collective action by means of elections, which allow voters to make collective choices for leaders and policies. Informal solutions include riots, spontaneous strikes, and other actions that occur in special circumstances. Coordination problems arise when the actions of some agents affect the actions of others and when agents coordinate on positive behaviors (behaving honestly, trusting others, paying taxes) or negative behaviors (behaving dishonestly, not trusting others, evading taxes). Formal solutions to coordination problems involve laws and standards; informal solutions involve social norms and conventions.

Institutions and Economic Development Chapter Summary What Are Institutions? We have introduced the concept of institutions and shown that institutions matter for economic development. We have defined institutions as constraints on human behavior imposed by societal rules. Formal institutions, such as legal and political institutions, are written rules with codified statutes of enforcement verified by courts. Informal institutions are social norms or patterns of behavior dictated by cultural or religious beliefs. Informal rules are enforced in an informal way by peer pressure, a sense of moral obligation, or by informal enforcement agencies. What Do Institutions Do? Institutions play a role in solving problems inherent to economic and social transactions: informational problems, commitment problems including the hold-up problem, cooperation, and coordination problems. Informational problems arise most often when one of the parties to a transaction has information about the object of the transaction that the other party does not have. Informational problems are an impediment to efficient market transactions. Institutional solutions to informational problems are, for example, disclosure rules, warranties, return much of human behavior was influenced by cultural and social norms. John R. Commons (1862-1945) believed that transactions were the basis of any economic activity. He was interested in the legal and institutional aspects of transactions, and defined an institution as a collective action. He was one of the first economists to use the concepts of bounded rationality, incomplete contracts, and property rights, which became very prominent in institutionalist thinking. Ronald Coase (1910-) is a British economist who spent his career at the University of Chicago. His research centered on the notion of transaction costs, which he considered to be the reason why firms exist and why we observe many transactions taking place within a firm rather than across legal entities. His 1937 article, “The Nature of the Firm,” is one of the most influential writings in economics. His 1960 article, “The Problem of Social Cost,” in which he developed the famous Coase theorem, states that private contracts can efficiently deal with externalities as long as there are well-defined property rights in place. He strongly encouraged the development of research at the intersection between Law and Economics and received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991. Oliver Williamson (1932-) developed transaction-cost economics and his ideas gained wide acceptance among mainstream economists. He also developed the idea of the hold-up problem and of asset-specific investments, as well as many other related concepts. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009. Douglass North (1920-) is an economic historian who emphasized the role of institutions in securing property rights and in explaining economic success over the long term. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993. Mancur Olson (1932-1998) was the first economist to put forward the collective-action problem and to explain that individuals could free ride on the efforts of others. He developed the idea that collective action is like a public good and will be underprovided by only private efforts. He predicted that large groups with a minimal stake in public action will tend to suffer more from the collective-action problem than will small groups with a very large stake in public action. His work was seminal in understanding why inefficient institutions may persist.

Structural Change and Development Strategies this means that it is possible to withdraw people from agriculture without any negative effect on agricultural output. This is one of the key insights of the Lewis model. Capital accumulation in the modern sector. A second difference between the two sectors is that the industrial sector is assumed to become more productive as it receives more capital. Note that in Figure 2, we have two production functions in the industrial sector, F ( K 1 , L ) and F ( K 2 , L ). When the level of capital in the sector increases from K 1 to K 2 , two things happen: 1) with a higher level of capital, we can produce more output with the same amount of labor, and 2) at any given level of labor, the marginal product of labor rises with the addition of more capital. 3 Let us examine in depth the implications of the second point. Suppose that the market wage for labor is equal to the marginal product of labor at L m ’ on F ( K 1 , L ). When the level of capital increases to K 2 , we can achieve the same marginal product of labor at a higher level of labor, L m ” on F ( K 2 , L ) in Figure 2. This means that enterprises in the industrial sector will hire more labor, up to L m ”, if the wage level remains the same as before. 3 The marginal product of labor increases when there is an addition of capital. This is the complementarity between capital and labor. FIGURE 2 The Production Function in the Traditional Agricultural and Modern Industrial Sectors Agricultural labor Industrial labor Agricultural output Industrial output L A * L m H L m h F ( K 2 , L ) F ( K 1 , L ) In the traditional agricultural sector, output increases with agricultural labor: the marginal product of labor, the slope of the production function, is positive and declining. However, past point L A * , agricultural output stays flat as more labor is added: the marginal product of labor is equal to zero. In the modern industrial sector, even though the marginal product of labor declines with industrial labor (it is smaller at L m ” compared to L m ’), capital accumulation shifts the production function upwards, from F ( K 1 , L ) to F ( K 2 , L ), and increases the marginal product of labor. For the same amount of labor L m ”, the marginal product of labor is higher with the level of capital K 2 compared to the smaller level of capital K 1 . 


Political Institutions representative—the candidate with the most votes—is elected per legislative district. The term “majoritarian rule” is not well chosen because it is not necessary to have a majority of votes to win an election with this method. All that a candidate needs is to have more votes than the other candidates. For example, a candidate who garners 20% of the votes while 8 others only receive 10% of the votes wins under this plurality rule. Theoretically, a party could get 100% of the seats in a legislature with only 20% of the votes if the candidates in all districts received the same distribution of votes. This is an extreme example, but it is possible for a party to gain a majority of seats without having a majority of votes. The other common electoral rule, one that stands in contrast to the majoritarian rule, is the proportional rule , often called PR. In its purest form, the proportional rule allocates the share of seats for the different parties proportionally to the number of votes each party receives. This is not always exactly possible, as the number of representatives is a whole number. For example, in a parliament of 100, if a party gets 13. % of the votes, it does not get a half seat and will win either 13 or 14 seats depending on the particulars of the electoral rule. An electoral rule is more proportional if the size of the electoral district is very large. If, for example, there are only three seats in a district, the proportion of seats will tend to deviate from the share of votes. If a party gets 56% of the votes, it will get 2 seats out of 3, the closest integer number to 56% out of 3. However, if the district has 30 seats, the allocation of seats will be more proportional to the share of votes. With the same vote share, the party will get 17 seats out of 30. Some countries that take proportional rule very seriously have only a single legislative district for the whole country. This is the case, for example, in Israel. One measure of the proportionality of an electoral rule is the district magnitude , the average number of seats in a district. By definition, majoritarian rule has a district magnitude of 1, whereas countries with proportional rule have a higher district magnitude. Note that many intermediate electoral rules between proportional and majoritarian also exist. Figure 6 shows a map of the two main types of electoral rules, majoritarian and PR. The distribution of majoritarian electoral rule is concentrated in former British colonies: the United States, Canada, Australia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the former British colonies in Africa and Asia. How does an electoral rule correlate with a political regime? Most Latin American countries use the proportional rule in combination with a presidential regime, whereas most European countries use proportional rule and a parliamentary regime. Majoritarian rule is restricted to English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as well as other former British colonies, which usually have a parliamentary regime, with the exception of the United States. The Economic Effects of Democratic Institutions Do institutional differences between the various types of democracy matter for economic performance? It turns out they do. Table 1 shows data relative to the outcomes of fiscal policy in democracies with presidential and parliamentary regimes, and in those with majoritarian and electoral rule.

Institutions and Economic Development The Cooperation Problem In a situation where individuals follow their self-interest in making their choices and where the outcomes of these choices are less than optimal for all parties, a cooperation problem arises. This means that if individuals cooperated to find a solution that would be better for all parties involved, they could achieve a better payoff. The prisoner’s dilemma. Economists represent the cooperation problem with the prisoner’s dilemma, an important example of game theory , which studies decisions of agents with payoffs that depend on the actions of other agents. In the prisoner’s dilemma , two suspects have been arrested by the police and are interrogated in the attempt to extract confessions to a joint crime. Each prisoner is in a separate cell and cannot communicate with the other. As Table 1 shows, if neither confesses, they will both serve a maximum of 6 months in jail. If they both confess, they will each serve 2 years. However, if one confesses and the other does not, the one who confesses will be set free immediately while the other will spend 10 years in jail. What will happen? Game theory tells us that the Nash equilibrium , a situation in which each agent has chosen an action that is optimal given the action of the other, is the scenario in which both confess. A Nash equilibrium also occurs when one player does not want to deviate from his or her actions given the actions of the other. Let us examine the strategies presented by the prisoner’s dilemma. Suppose B confesses. It is then in A’s best interest to confess also. If A does not confess, he will get 10 years, and if he does confess he will get 2 years. If B decides not to confess, it is again in A’s best interest to confess. Indeed, if A does not confess, he will get 6 months, but if he does confess, he walks free. We see that whether B decides to confess or not, it is always in A’s best interest to confess. This is called a dominant strategy , a situation in which the same action is optimal and independent of what the other player chooses. It is a dominant strategy for Prisoner A to confess. Since Prisoner B’s reasoning is the same as Prisoner A’s, Prisoner B will also decide to confess. Therefore, they will both serve 2 years. They would both be better off if they had decided not to confess. In that case, they would each only get 6 months. However, this is not a Nash equilibrium. Suppose that they each decided not to confess. In that case, each would gain individually by changing his mind and confessing in order to walk free. B stays silent. B confesses. A stays silent. Both serve 6 months. Prisoner A serves 10 years. Prisoner B goes free. A confesses. Prisoner A goes free. Prisoner B serves 10 years. Both serve 2 years. Prisoners A and B decide individually whether to confess to a crime. It would be in their joint interest for both to stay silent, but if they follow their self-interest, they will both choose to confess . .. and end up staying in jail longer. TABLE 1 The Prisoner’s Dilemma 


Institutions and Economic Development Democracy and the collective-action problem. Political institutions can either help to overcome collective action problems or can exacerbate them. In dictatorships, the leaders usually ban political parties and associations; as a result, the opposition must organize secretly. Punishment for establishing or participating in opposition groups may mean death or lengthy jail time. In democracies, freedom of association is a fundamental right. Professional associations and NGOs even receive assistance from the government in the form of grants and subsidies, even though they are associated with the government. In other words, democracy allows and even encourages the establishment of associations to overcome collective-action problems. Moreover, elections, the primary institution of democracy, provide a way to overcome one of the most fundamental collective-action problems faced by societies, replacing corrupt or inefficient leaders with better leaders. In a democracy, people come to the polls and can vote out incumbent leaders who no longer represent voters’ interests or who have abused their powers. Informal solutions to the cooperation problem. Most solutions to the cooperation problem tend to be formalized in some way. For example, trade unions, professional associations, and NGOs have their own rules and organizational structures that ensure the groups’ proper functioning. This does not mean that there are no informal solutions to the cooperation problem. For example, spontaneous riots can break out in a developing country that can potentially lead to political change. Mine workers might engage in a spontaneous strike without consulting trade-union leaders. In 1989, Protestant activists started small In 2009, Elinor Ostrom was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was jointly awarded to Oliver Williamson, one of the most famous researchers working on institutions. Ostrom’s best-known work focuses on the emergence of institutions to solve tragedy-of-thecommons situations, in particular the management of common resources. Examples include water supplies, fish stocks, forests, and grazing lands. Economists automatically tend to think of two basic solutions to manage common resources: privatize them by selling rights to access them or let a central government regulate access to them. Ostrom found that in many of these situations, structures emerge from local governments that prevent overexploitation of common resources. Local communities establish rules to regulate access and put in place conflict-resolution mechanisms to enforce the rules and monitor resource use. For example, farmers would take turns to graze cows or utilize scarce water. People in the community would create boundaries where wood cutting was allowed, etc. These local structures also enforce sanctions for violation of the rules. The governance structures generally work well when they are based on democratic decisionmaking processes and are most effective in smaller communities where people know and trust each other, and interact regularly. It is also easier in smaller communities to enforce collective sanctions on individuals who break the rules. Elinor Ostrom and Institutional Solutions to the Preservation of Common Resources

Institutions and Economic Development each other again before their appointment, it is likely that both will go to the Central Station. This is an example of a focal point. Conventions are usually well understood within a country or a particular culture, but not always across countries. In many cultures, a nod of the head up and down means “yes,” while a movement of the head back and forth from left to right means “no.” When greeting someone, Americans shake hands, but the Japanese bow. The exchange of business cards is fundamental to business etiquette in most of Asia, but not in many other countries. In the Middle East, showing the sole of your shoe to somebody else is considered an insult. Similar body movements or actions can have different interpretations in different societies. There are hundreds, probably thousands of social cues that differ across cultures and can make cross-cultural communication difficult, even when the language barrier is not significant. It is always respectful in a foreign country to show the locals that you have some knowledge of their local customs and conventions. Many social norms are not necessarily fundamental for economic development. Some norms may, however, play a very important role: norms of honesty and trust, norms of conflict resolution (peaceful or violent), norms of equality between men and women, norms related to individual savings behavior, or norms related to effort. The Persistence of Inefficient Institutions In this chapter, we have seen how institutions help solve economic problems that stem from lack of information, commitment, and cooperation or coordination problems. While developed countries have institutions to solve these problems, developing countries are often not as fortunate. The lack of formal institutions impedes economic growth by raising the costs of transactions and slowing the flow of capital into a developing country. If improving institutions is crucial for successful development, we should ask why it is not happening. Reforming institutions is not as simple as signing a contract between two individuals. Inefficient institutions can even persist for a very long time and for a variety of complex reasons. The Functionalist Fallacy We have seen what institutions do, but not why institutions are in place. Understanding the functions that institutions perform is one thing; understanding why they emerge is another. Institutions, just like technical innovations, are often the unintended consequences of actions designed to solve other problems. We know what microwave ovens do; they have become indispensable household appliances to warm or defrost food quickly. The microwave oven can warm a meal much faster than a traditional oven but that was not the purpose its inventor had in mind. It was an accidental byproduct of research to make better radar systems. Dr. Percy Spencer, an engineer working for the Raytheon Corporation, was testing a vacuum tube called a magnetron while researching improvements to conventional radar when he noticed that a candy bar in his pocket had melted. He put an egg and some corn kernels near the tube and found that those foods

Institutions and Economic Development Institutional solutions to coordination problems. In developing countries, formal laws help individuals and groups select one coordination equilibrium over another. This is the case for the traffic law example. The regulation of standards is another important solution to the coordination problem; railroads, for example, have different track widths in different countries, but most nations have implemented the international standard track width of 56.5 inches ( ,435 mm). India and Pakistan instead inherited a broader gauge of 66 inches ( ,676 mm) from the British colonial period, while Russia and the other nations of the former Soviet Union, as well as Mongolia, adopted a gauge of 59.84 inches ( ,520 mm). Differences in gauge across countries tend to persist because of the costs of standardization. This requires passengers to change trains at international borders or await an axle adjustment, both of which are costly. Informal solutions to coordination problems. Conventions, a type of social norm, are enforced informally by peer pressure and experience, and do not require legal enforcement. For example, when a telephone conversation is interrupted, the caller is usually the one to recall. Otherwise, each caller would be calling or no one at all would be calling back. In 2005, Thomas Schelling received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his studies of coordination problems. He put forward the concept of focal point to understand how people can coordinate their actions. A focal point is a solution to a coordination problem that most people will find without having to communicate. For example, if two people decide to meet in a big city like Rio de Janeiro, but forget to specify where and do not have the opportunity to call The stag hunt game is a coordination problem that was first formulated by the 18th-century French philosopher, Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). Economists and social scientists often use it as the prototype for all the coordination problems faced by societies and other groups in the real world. The following table illustrates the stag hunt game. Two hunters, A and B, are stalking game in a forest. Each can either choose to hunt a hare or a stag. A stag is more valuable than a hare but will only be caught if A and B hunt together. In this case, they both get a payoff of 4. If a player chooses to hunt a hare, he will get a payoff of 3. However, a player who chooses to hunt a stag while the other hunts a hare will not be successful and will have a payoff of 0. This table shows the benefits of hunting together because the payoff for hunting a stag together is higher than hunting for a hare individually. This is a coordination game, since it has multiple equilibria (both hunt a stag and both hunt a hare) and there is no dominant strategy: if one player hunts a stag, then the other will choose to do the same, but if one player hunts a hare, then the other player will also hunt a hare. We can easily use the structure of the stag hunt game to examine issues that are relevant to developing countries, such as high or low levels of coordination in terms of law abidance or tax evasion. The Stag Hunt Game A: Stag A: Hare B: Stag 4, 4 0, 3 B: Hare 3, 0 3, 3 


Institutions and Economic Development Democracy and the collective-action problem. Political institutions can either help to overcome collective action problems or can exacerbate them. In dictatorships, the leaders usually ban political parties and associations; as a result, the opposition must organize secretly.

Institutions and Economic Development The collective-action problem. Another important example of the prisoner’s dilemma is the collective-action problem , when people fail to undertake a collective action even though it is in their joint interest to do so. Imagine an Indian municipality’s decision to authorize the construction of a chemical factory that will pollute the town’s air and water, and suppose that the residents are opposed to the decision. To defeat the project, the population needs to be organized, but doing so is costly. Assume that if at least half the population shows up at a demonstration to protest the decision, the project will be abandoned. If, instead, less than half of the population shows up, the project will go forward. Demonstrating is costly and inconvenient, however, and much of the population would rather spend their free time elsewhere. Just as in the prisoner’s dilemma, if very few demonstrate, participation will not be effective and it will not be optimal for anyone to demonstrate. However, if at least half of the population goes to the demonstration, any resident can free ride and benefit from the Cooperation problems have always been present in human societies. One example is that of the tragedy of the commons. In English villages before the 16th century, parcels of land, called the commons, that belonged to a collection of individual farmers were accessible to the whole village. While all villagers could let their sheep graze on the commons, individual villagers had an incentive to let their sheep overgraze there without feeling responsible for the potential damage to the land. No matter what the other villagers decided to do, an individual’s maximum self-interest lay in letting his sheep graze as much as possible on the commons so that each villager would have to secure less feed for his sheep. Of course, this selfinterest led to serious overgrazing. In the 16th and 17th centuries, there was an “enclosure” movement launched by the British landed aristocracy to keep the commons away from those who did not have property claims, usually the poor peasants. This movement had major social effects on the English countryside and resulted in large numbers of peasants becoming severely impoverished and leaving their villages for the cities. We do not know exactly how much overgrazing there was in England at the time, but the tragedy of the commons is an illustration of a more general phenomenon that has occurred over and over in history, the overexploitation of arable land and the depletion of natural resources. The “fertile crescent” in the Middle East, around the Nile, Jordan, Tigris, and Euphrates rivers, was one of the most arable and productive areas of the ancient world. Overexploitation has eroded the quality of the soil and led to desertification. Similar problems have occurred in other regions due to deforestation; the population of Easter Island nearly became extinct following its complete exploitation of the island’s native tree species. 8 Deforestation of the Amazon rain forest in South America, the major producer of oxygen on the planet, is occurring at a phenomenal speed; the annual loss of rain forest in the Amazon region is roughly 10,000 square miles, nearly the size of Massachusetts. 8 See, for example, James A. Brander and M. Scott Taylor, “The Simple Economics of Easter Island: A Ricardo-Malthus Model of Renewable Resource Use,” The American Economic Review 88, no. 1 (March 1998): 119-138.

Institutions and Economic Development Chapter Summary What Are Institutions? We have introduced the concept of institutions and shown that institutions matter for economic development. We have defined institutions as constraints on human behavior imposed by societal rules. Formal institutions, such as legal and political institutions, are written rules with codified statutes of enforcement verified by courts. Informal institutions are social norms or patterns of behavior dictated by cultural or religious beliefs. Informal rules are enforced in an informal way by peer pressure, a sense of moral obligation, or by informal enforcement agencies. What Do Institutions Do? Institutions play a role in solving problems inherent to economic and social transactions: informational problems, commitment problems including the hold-up problem, cooperation, and coordination problems. Informational problems arise most often when one of the parties to a transaction has information about the object of the transaction that the other party does not have. Informational problems are an impediment to efficient market transactions. Institutional solutions to informational problems are, for example, disclosure rules, warranties, return much of human behavior was influenced by cultural and social norms. John R. Commons (1862-1945) believed that transactions were the basis of any economic activity. He was interested in the legal and institutional aspects of transactions, and defined an institution as a collective action. He was one of the first economists to use the concepts of bounded rationality, incomplete contracts, and property rights, which became very prominent in institutionalist thinking. Ronald Coase (1910-) is a British economist who spent his career at the University of Chicago. His research centered on the notion of transaction costs, which he considered to be the reason why firms exist and why we observe many transactions taking place within a firm rather than across legal entities. His 1937 article, “The Nature of the Firm,” is one of the most influential writings in economics. His 1960 article, “The Problem of Social Cost,” in which he developed the famous Coase theorem, states that private contracts can efficiently deal with externalities as long as there are well-defined property rights in place. He strongly encouraged the development of research at the intersection between Law and Economics and received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991. Oliver Williamson (1932-) developed transaction-cost economics and his ideas gained wide acceptance among mainstream economists. He also developed the idea of the hold-up problem and of asset-specific investments, as well as many other related concepts. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009. Douglass North (1920-) is an economic historian who emphasized the role of institutions in securing property rights and in explaining economic success over the long term. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993. Mancur Olson (1932-1998) was the first economist to put forward the collective-action problem and to explain that individuals could free ride on the efforts of others. He developed the idea that collective action is like a public good and will be underprovided by only private efforts. He predicted that large groups with a minimal stake in public action will tend to suffer more from the collective-action problem than will small groups with a very large stake in public action. His work was seminal in understanding why inefficient institutions may persist.

This requires passengers to change trains at international borders or await an axle adjustment, both of which are costly. Informal solutions to coordination problems. Conventions, a type of social norm, are enforced informally by peer pressure and experience, and do not require legal enforcement. For example, when a telephone conversation is interrupted, the caller is usually the one to recall. Otherwise, each caller would be calling or no one at all would be calling back. In 2005, Thomas Schelling received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his studies of coordination problems. He put forward the concept of focal point to understand how people can coordinate their actions. A focal point is a solution to a coordination problem that most people will find without having to communicate. For example, if two people decide to meet in a big city like Rio de Janeiro, but forget to specify where and do not have the opportunity to call The stag hunt game is a coordination problem that was first formulated by the 18th-century French philosopher, Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). Economists and social scientists often use it as the prototype for all the coordination problems faced by societies and other groups in the real world. The following table illustrates the stag hunt game. Two hunters, A and B, are stalking game in a forest. Each can either choose to hunt a hare or a stag. A stag is more valuable than a hare but will only be caught if A and B hunt together. In this case, they both get a payoff of 4. If a player chooses to hunt a hare, he will get a payoff of 3. However, a player who chooses to hunt a stag while the other hunts a hare will not be successful and will have a payoff of 0. This table shows the benefits of hunting together because the payoff for hunting a stag together is higher than hunting for a hare individually. This is a coordination game, since it has multiple equilibria (both hunt a stag and both hunt a hare) and there is no dominant strategy: if one player hunts a stag, then the other will choose to do the same, but if one player hunts a hare, then the other player will also hunt a hare. We can easily use the structure of the stag hunt game to examine issues that are relevant to developing countries, such as high or low levels of coordination in terms of law abidance or tax evasion.

Institutions and Economic Development areas) do not have a medical degree. These “doctors” are often completely incompetent: they are unable to make correct diagnoses and tend to prescribe unnecessary medicines. 3 Other solutions to informational problems are the result of actions taken by firms that are sometimes backed by legal institutions. An obvious example is the association of a warranty (the obligation by a seller to guarantee the quality of a product) with a sales contract. Warranties take different forms, such as a guarantee to repair goods for free within a specified amount of time after the purchase of a good or after the replacement of a deficient component of that good. Return policies allow the buyer to bring purchased goods back to the seller within a specified time after their purchase. Warranties and return policies make it possible for the seller to give credible information about the product. If consumers can learn quickly about the quality or usefulness of a product, a return policy signals to a buyer that the seller is confident in the quality of the product. If it requires long-term use of a product to determine its quality, a warranty is a better way to signal quality to a consumer by shifting any repair risk onto the seller. Sellers also use brand names to indicate quality. Signaling is an economic term that means taking certain actions to provide other parties in a transaction with credible information. In the case of a sales contract, it means giving credible information to consumers about the quality of a product. Consumers consider a well-known brand name with a reputation for good quality to be reliable, and they will trust products from that brand. The company that has established a brand name has an interest in keeping its reputation because it is the basis for consumer trust in its products. Entering a franchise contract allows an entrepreneur to benefit from the reputation of a brand, which makes it possible to attract customers more easily. Franchising allows businesses to expand very easily, but firms need to monitor their franchisees, as loss of brand reputation can be quite damaging. In China, the developing world’s largest economy, there has been an expansion of franchised fast-food chains in recent years with KFC and McDonalds from the United States, Ajisen Ramen or Saizeriya from Japan, or even Chinese fastfood chains such as Da Niang Dumpling and Ji Xiang Wanton. According to the marketing research firm A. C. Nielsen, food hygiene security is cited as the top reason for the popularity of fast-food chains in China, as opposed to restaurants. This concern is understandable; cases of food poisoning in Chinese restaurants have increased in recent years. For example, the Xinhua News Agency reported that in 2007, 258 people died from food poisoning in China, an increase of 32% over 2006. Some fast-food chains in China have failed precisely because they were not able to build a reputation for safe food. This was the case for Rong Hua Chicken, which tried to compete directly with KFC. The chain was started in 1994, but had closed by 2000 because it was unable to enforce strict rules on the quality of raw and processed foods, leading to safety concerns. Chain stores also rely on the logic of brand recognition. We know familiar names such as CVS, Best Buy, or Walmart in the United States, but there are 3 See, for example, Jishnu Das and Jeffrey Hammer, “Which Doctor?

Institutions and Economic Development each other again before their appointment, it is likely that both will go to the Central Station. This is an example of a focal point. Conventions are usually well understood within a country or a particular culture, but not always across countries. In many cultures, a nod of the head up and down means “yes,” while a movement of the head back and forth from left to right means “no.” When greeting someone, Americans shake hands, but the Japanese bow. The exchange of business cards is fundamental to business etiquette in most of Asia, but not in many other countries. In the Middle East, showing the sole of your shoe to somebody else is considered an insult. Similar body movements or actions can have different interpretations in different societies. There are hundreds, probably thousands of social cues that differ across cultures and can make cross-cultural communication difficult, even when the language barrier is not significant. It is always respectful in a foreign country to show the locals that you have some knowledge of their local customs and conventions. Many social norms are not necessarily fundamental for economic development. Some norms may, however, play a very important role: norms of honesty and trust, norms of conflict resolution (peaceful or violent), norms of equality between men and women, norms related to individual savings behavior, or norms related to effort. The Persistence of Inefficient Institutions In this chapter, we have seen how institutions help solve economic problems that stem from lack of information, commitment, and cooperation or coordination problems. While developed countries have institutions to solve these problems, developing countries are often not as fortunate. The lack of formal institutions impedes economic growth by raising the costs of transactions and slowing the flow of capital into a developing country. If improving institutions is crucial for successful development, we should ask why it is not happening. Reforming institutions is not as simple as signing a contract between two individuals. Inefficient institutions can even persist for a very long time and for a variety of complex reasons. The Functionalist Fallacy We have seen what institutions do, but not why institutions are in place. Understanding the functions that institutions perform is one thing; understanding why they emerge is another. Institutions, just like technical innovations, are often the unintended consequences of actions designed to solve other problems. We know what microwave ovens do; they have become indispensable household appliances to warm or defrost food quickly. The microwave oven can warm a meal much faster than a traditional oven but that was not the purpose its inventor had in mind. It was an accidental byproduct of research to make better radar systems. Dr. Percy Spencer, an engineer working for the Raytheon Corporation, was testing a vacuum tube called a magnetron while researching improvements to conventional radar when he noticed that a candy bar in his pocket had melted. He put an egg and some corn kernels near the tube and found that those foods 


Political Institutions representative—the candidate with the most votes—is elected per legislative district. The term “majoritarian rule” is not well chosen because it is not necessary to have a majority of votes to win an election with this method. All that a candidate needs is to have more votes than the other candidates. For example, a candidate who garners 20% of the votes while 8 others only receive 10% of the votes wins under this plurality rule. Theoretically, a party could get 100% of the seats in a legislature with only 20% of the votes if the candidates in all districts received the same distribution of votes. This is an extreme example, but it is possible for a party to gain a majority of seats without having a majority of votes. The other common electoral rule, one that stands in contrast to the majoritarian rule, is the proportional rule , often called PR. In its purest form, the proportional rule allocates the share of seats for the different parties proportionally to the number of votes each party receives. This is not always exactly possible, as the number of representatives is a whole number. For example, in a parliament of 100, if a party gets 13. % of the votes, it does not get a half seat and will win either 13 or 14 seats depending on the particulars of the electoral rule. An electoral rule is more proportional if the size of the electoral district is very large. If, for example, there are only three seats in a district, the proportion of seats will tend to deviate from the share of votes. If a party gets 56% of the votes, it will get 2 seats out of 3, the closest integer number to 56% out of 3. However, if the district has 30 seats, the allocation of seats will be more proportional to the share of votes. With the same vote share, the party will get 17 seats out of 30. Some countries that take proportional rule very seriously have only a single legislative district for the whole country. This is the case, for example, in Israel. One measure of the proportionality of an electoral rule is the district magnitude , the average number of seats in a district. By definition, majoritarian rule has a district magnitude of 1, whereas countries with proportional rule have a higher district magnitude. Note that many intermediate electoral rules between proportional and majoritarian also exist. Figure 6 shows a map of the two main types of electoral rules, majoritarian and PR. The distribution of majoritarian electoral rule is concentrated in former British colonies: the United States, Canada, Australia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the former British colonies in Africa and Asia. How does an electoral rule correlate with a political regime? Most Latin American countries use the proportional rule in combination with a presidential regime, whereas most European countries use proportional rule and a parliamentary regime. Majoritarian rule is restricted to English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as well as other former British colonies, which usually have a parliamentary regime, with the exception of the United States. The Economic Effects of Democratic Institutions Do institutional differences between the various types of democracy matter for economic performance? It turns out they do. Table 1 shows data relative to the outcomes of fiscal policy in democracies with presidential and parliamentary regimes, and in those with majoritarian and electoral rule. 


Political Institutions has no hope of winning the election or of influencing government policy. Despite these limitations, the median voter model is very useful for characterizing political conflicts over income redistribution in a democracy. It is also the most popular model researchers use to examine policy choices in a democracy. To better understand the median voter theorem and its effects on income redistribution policies in a democracy, we present a political model of taxation. Call y i the income of individual i and call y average income in the economy. Call t the tax rate on income that will be determined in the democracy. Call f the lump-sum redistributive transfer received by each voter in the economy and financed from tax revenues. The budget constraint (on a per capita basis) is such that average tax revenues (or the tax revenue on average income) finance the per capita lump-sum transfer. We assume a distortionary loss from taxation that is a convex function of the tax rate. For simplicity, we assume that this loss is quadratic and takes the following form: 1 2 t 2 y . This loss must thus be deducted from the tax revenues. The budget constraint of government can thus be written: ( t 1 2 t 2 ) y = f The net income of an individual (after tax and redistribution) is therefore: (1 t ) y i + f Given the budget constraint, we can replace f in the expression for net individual income and get: (1 t ) y i + ( t 1 2 t 2 ) y The preferred tax rate maximizes this objective function. The derivative of this function with respect to t will be equal to zero at the maximum: y i + y ty = 0 = 7 t = 1 y i y The preferred tax rate of an individual is thus higher the lower that individual’s income y i is relative to average income y. Individuals with a higher-than-average income would prefer a negative tax rate, which is not possible. They are thus opposed to redistributing income from rich to poor. In a political equilibrium, the tax rate will be that preferred by the median voter: t m = 1 y m y The lower the income of the median voter relative to average income, the higher the tax rate and thus the level of redistribution. The median voter model predicts, therefore, that more income inequality should lead to more income redistribution through the political process. In effect, the principle of “one person, one vote” gives poor people the same weight as rich people in elections. In this way, elections give the majority of poor the possibility to correct an unequal income distribution. The Median Voter Theorem and Redistribution Autocracy and Democracy Compared Let us now compare the economic effects of democracy and autocracy. A democracy redistributes some income from the rich to the poor. This redistribution is accomplished through the principle of “one man, one vote,” which we should call “one person, one vote.” In contrast, an autocracy does not usually redistribute from the rich to the poor. 3 It might engage in redistributive

Institutions and Economic Development Institutional solutions to coordination problems. In developing countries, formal laws help individuals and groups select one coordination equilibrium over another. This is the case for the traffic law example. The regulation of standards is another important solution to the coordination problem; railroads, for example, have different track widths in different countries, but most nations have implemented the international standard track width of 56.5 inches ( ,435 mm). India and Pakistan instead inherited a broader gauge of 66 inches ( ,676 mm) from the British colonial period, while Russia and the other nations of the former Soviet Union, as well as Mongolia, adopted a gauge of 59.84 inches ( ,520 mm). Differences in gauge across countries tend to persist because of the costs of standardization. This requires passengers to change trains at international borders or await an axle adjustment, both of which are costly. Informal solutions to coordination problems.

Political Institutions equilibrium, that is, a situation in which no candidate has an incentive to move away from his platform given the platform presented by the competitor. Both politicians will indeed have strong incentives to move toward the center until their platform is the one the median voter prefers. Look now at the second line on Figure 4. Here, candidate A has moved more toward the center while candidate A has not. A then gets the votes of all those who are to the left of A and of all those who are to the left of half the distance between A and B , that is, all those between A and c . As point c is to the right of the median, A will get more than 50% of the votes, and B will get less than 50% and will be defeated. B will then be far better off moving toward the median voter in order to react to A ’s move and attract more votes. Candidates A and B will only stop moving once both propose a platform that corresponds exactly to the preferences of the median voter as in the third line in Figure 4. They then each get exactly all the votes to the left and to the right, respectively, of the median. The median voter is indifferent between both and will toss a coin. Each party thus has exactly a 50% chance of winning the election, but both are offering the same platform, that preferred by the median voter. Once they compete at the median, neither has an incentive to move away. A political equilibrium has been reached. The main focus of political disagreement in democracies is the left- right conflict. We can interpret this as preferences for income redistribution, with voters on the left the most in favor of redistribution and those on the right the least in favor. Preferences for redistribution are often strongly correlated with income levels. Because poorer individuals pay fewer taxes, they will prefer higher taxes on wealthy individuals to redistribute income from the rich to the poor. Those with higher incomes will prefer lower taxes and those with the highest incomes will prefer no redistribution at all. Preferences for taxation and redistribution are thus inversely related to income. What does the median voter theorem tell us in this context? The median voter will be the one with median income, that is, the voter whose income is exactly higher than the 50% poorest in the population and exactly lower than the 50% richest. The more unequal the income distribution, the lower the income of the median voter will be and the stronger his or her preference for redistribution. This implies that in a democracy, high income inequality will lead to a high level of redistribution. The median voter model relies on a number of very specific assumptions. It assumes that only one dimension of political conflict exists. In many countries, however, left-right conflicts over income redistribution are only one political dimension, while others such as ethnic, religious, or territorial divisions as well as attitudes about abortion, gay marriage, and other social issues also exist. The median voter model is unable to deliver predictions if there is more than one dimension. Also, it unrealistically assumes that politicians know voter preferences perfectly and it assumes that there are only two parties. If there are more than two parties, the situation becomes more complicated. The model further assumes that citizens vote sincerely, in the sense that they vote for the party closest to their preferences. If there are more than two parties, voters may vote strategically and sometimes vote for a larger party farther from their preferences because the party they prefer

Political Institutions do not. The Americas, Western Europe, and Oceania (Australia, New Zealand, and surrounding Pacific islands) all have electoral democracies. The picture is more mixed in Africa and Asia. The countries of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as many sub-Saharan nations, do not qualify. 1 China, Vietnam, and North Korea are not democracies, nor are some other Asian countries such as Myanmar and Pakistan. Russia and many of the former Soviet republics also do not qualify. The Polity IV is a relevant database that provides indicators of democracy and autocracy for all countries since 1800 or independence. The democracy index ranges from 0 to 10 and takes into account the competitiveness of political participation, constraints on the executive, and openness and competitiveness in the recruitment of candidates for the executive. The autocracy index is constructed in a similar fashion, but measures the degree to which competitiveness of participation is repressed, participation is regulated, authority is concentrated in the executive, and executive recruitment is closed. The polity composite index shows the difference between the democracy and the autocracy index. A full democracy will have a polity index of 10, whereas a full autocracy will have an index of 10.

Structural Change and Development Strategies increase. If both sectors grow at the same rate, then the growing supply of coal for the steel sector will match the growing demand for coal by the steel sector. In an economy with unbalanced growth, if the steel sector grows faster than the coal sector, the increased demand for coal by the steel sector may not be met by the supply of coal from the domestic coal sector. Unbalanced growth results in excess supply in some sectors and excess demand in others. Balanced growth. The main argument for balanced growth is that an economy has a higher growth rate if it is in equilibrium, that is, if supply and demand across sectors grow in sync. Mathematical models developed in the 1950s and 1960s, including those by mathematical genius John von Neumann, indicated that growth was fastest along a balanced growth path. 9 Although these were quite sophisticated models, we can see the logic behind them in the following metaphor: A straight stretch of road represents balanced growth with all the wheels of a car traveling at the same speed. A curve in the road represents unbalanced growth as some of the car’s wheels must slow down in order to maintain its balance on the curve. The larger the turn, the more slowly the car will go in order to maintain its balance. Structural change in an economy is similar to a curve in the road. The economy must make a “turn” in its sectoral composition , a change in the weight of each sector in terms of the economy’s output, such as the weight of agriculture, the steel industry, the textile industry, etc. A car that follows a straight line travels faster than a car that turns, just as an economy in which all sectors grow at the same rate grows faster than an economy in which the sectoral composition undergoes change. In the coal and steel example considered above, if the capacity of the steel industry grows at a faster rate than that of the coal industry, the limited supply of coal will constrain steel production. Suppose that the capacity of the steel industry grows at 5% but that the capacity of coal industry grows at 2%. As long as the necessary technology and the amount of coal needed to produce a set amount of steel remain the same, steel output will not be able to grow at more than 2%. The steel industry cannot use its extra capacity due to the bottleneck in the coal industry. If some of the resources used to increase steel capacity had been used to increase coal-mining capacity, economic growth would be higher than 2%. Unbalanced growth. The primary argument for unbalanced growth, put forward by Albert Hirschmann, is that if government policy focuses on and assists in the development of one key sector, there will be positive externalities through intersectoral linkages and pressure for other sectors to grow as a result. 10 The concept of intersectoral linkage refers to the effects of conditions in one sector on other related sectors. There are two types of intersectoral linkages: backward linkages , effects on upstream sectors that play the role of 9 Among other achievements, von Neumann made major contributions to computer science and invented game theory. 10 Albert O.

Structural Change and Development Strategies increase. If both sectors grow at the same rate, then the growing supply of coal for the steel sector will match the growing demand for coal by the steel sector. In an economy with unbalanced growth, if the steel sector grows faster than the coal sector, the increased demand for coal by the steel sector may not be met by the supply of coal from the domestic coal sector. Unbalanced growth results in excess supply in some sectors and excess demand in others. Balanced growth.

Structural Change and Development Strategies with the problem of rural to urban migration. Most countries do not restrict migration and pay the price of having high levels of urban unemployment. Ideally, urban unemployment would not exist if there were no wage rigidities in the urban sector. However, if it is difficult to do away with those rigidities, then unrestricted migration will lead to excess migration. China, for example, has chosen to restrict internal migration to deal with this problem. Reducing urban unemployment by restricting migration from the countryside seems like an unnecessarily proscriptive policy to those of us for whom freedom to move is a fundamental human right. Our instincts on these matters, however, are not always consistent. We are shocked by restrictions to mobility within a country, but are less shocked by restrictions to mobility across countries. Are these restrictions different? Shouldn’t the same principles that make us defend freedom of migration within a country lead us to also defend freedom of migration across countries? There is no easy answer to these questions. The main policy conclusion to draw from the Harris-Todaro model is that more should be done in developing countries for the economic development of rural areas, both to create attractive income opportunities (both farm and nonfarm income) in the countryside, and to improve the delivery of public services such as health care and infrastructure, reducing the likelihood that people will migrate to cities. A poor countryside will create poverty in the cities, while a more developed countryside will reduce urban poverty. Development Strategies: Sectoral Growth We have discussed how the transfer of labor from the traditional agricultural sector to the modern industrial sector may take place. We have not discussed what strategies governments follow in order to develop the modern sector. These development strategies differ in terms of which of them are given priority, whether efforts are concentrated on one sector or on many sectors at the same time, and what methods are used to manage the spillover effects of growth in a particular sector on other sectors. We first examine different theories related to sectoral growth , the expansion of specific sectors of the economy, and ask whether it is better to encourage equal growth across the different industrial sectors or, instead, to promote the growth of particular industrial sectors at the expense of others. We then take a closer look at the idea that a large-scale investment in one industrial sector will result in the growth of related and interconnected sectors. Balanced and Unbalanced Growth A continued focus of discussions on structural change since the 1950s and 1960s has been whether we should favor balanced growth , in which all economic sectors grow at the same rate, or unbalanced growth , in which sectors grow at different rates. With balanced growth, supply and demand remain in equilibrium over time in all sectors. Take the example of an economy with a steel sector and a coal sector. As the steel sector expands, its demand for coal will also

Political Institutions In other countries, decolonization also took place as a response to the development of radical anticolonial revolutionary movements that threatened to expropriate colonial interests. But decolonization did not necessarily result in democratization. In Algeria, for example, a nationalist one-party rule was instituted after the French left the country in the aftermath of a very bloody colonial war. Democratization and income inequality. While we know that the elite may accept democratization and even propose it in response to revolutionary threats, we still have not addressed why there should be more democratization when income inequality is lower. Acemoglu and Robinson’s theory also provides an answer to that question. We have seen that democracy was overthrown in some countries. Many military coups d’état have abolished democracy and introduced a military dictatorship that favors the interests of the elite. But coups do not happen overnight; just as revolutionary threats do not arise every day, the political and military conditions necessary for mounting a successful coup must be present and a sufficiently large number of the elite must be in favor of it. Moreover, coups are very costly. They may fail, in which case the result could be disastrous for the elite. Those who organized the failed attempt might lose their lives or land in prison. The reaction to an attempted overthrow of the existing government would almost surely lead to retaliatory measures against the elite, leading to expropriation of their assets and privileges. Even when a coup is successful, it is costly to consolidate and maintain, as very strong repression measures must be put in place. Given the fact that coups are costly, they occur more often in those cases where the benefits of staging them are larger. In societies where inequality is significant and where democracy may lead to severe redistributive outcomes, the elite may benefit more from a coup to prevent or undo those outcomes. In more egalitarian societies, the costs of organizing a coup might outweigh the benefits. Therefore, coups and reversals of democracy are more likely to occur in societies where inequality is greater. The elite in countries where inequality is significant might also resist democratization more. Instead of making concessions, they might gamble on repression in the hope that revolutionary movements would be thwarted. While this is not always the case, revolutions are more likely in countries with greater inequality. Kaiser Wilhelm II rather than against the French and English. The threat of revolution played a major role in the political upheaval that subsequently took place in Germany. Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated, the Weimar Republic was established, and the war ended for Germany. Workers were given voting rights, while the leaders of the Spartacist movement, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, were assassinated in the streets of Berlin by a group of veterans who were members of a paramilitary unit. In Europe, the spirit of the times after World War I was such that the elite were terrified by the prospect of the Communist revolution expanding worldwide, a goal that the Russian Marxists were actively supporting. In other countries such as Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden, voting rights were dramatically extended to make concessions to the working class and prevent a revolution that would expropriate the assets and privileges of their elites. 


Political Institutions It is thus very rare in a parliamentary government to have an executive that does not have a majority support in the legislative branch. When it happens, it is called a minority government. In a presidential system, however, because both the president and the legislature are elected independently, it can happen that the president does not have the political support of a legislative majority. The president can be a member of one party, while another party controls the legislature. This is called divided government . Figure 5 shows a map of the distribution of presidential and parliamentary democracies in the world. Presidential regimes are most often found in North and South America as well as in some of the countries of the former Soviet Union, in particular Russia. In the Americas, after countries gained their independence from the British and the Spanish monarchies, they established presidential systems. Parliamentary regimes are more the norm in Western Europe. They can also be found in former British colonies such as India. Electoral Rules Legislators can be elected by a variety of methods. One common electoral rule is the majoritarian rule , often also called “first past the post,” “plurality rule,” or “single-member district.” In the majoritarian rule, only one FIGURE 5 Presidential and Parliamentary Democracies Presidential Parliamentary Countries in blue have presidential democracies while countries in gray have parliamentary democracies.

Political Institutions democracy is or, conversely, for how authoritarian an autocracy is. As Figure 2 illustrates, the Polity IV index provides a more nuanced picture than the Freedom House index. Most Latin American countries, for example, while satisfying the Freedom House criteria for democracy, have a total polity score that is lower than that of the United States or the European democracies. A similar situation exists for Turkey, India, and Indonesia as well as some African democracies. Countries with a score between 5 and 5 have regimes that are neither a true democracy nor a true autocracy. They are labeled as anocracies in Figure 2. This is not a specific form of governance but a hybrid regime with elements of both autocracy and democracy. Russia, Venezuela, Algeria, and many African countries fall in this category. Some of these countries are likely to become stabilized democracies in the future, but others might not. Economic Effects of an Autocracy versus a Democracy A simple way to think about the effects an autocracy versus a democracy has on an economy is to start by assuming that those who hold political power will tend to use it and abuse it in their own interests. In other words, we apply to politicians the utility maximization hypothesis of economics.

Political Institutions P olitical institutions play a key role in society because they determine the allocation of political power between different groups of citizens. The allocation of power affects how laws are made and whose interests they serve. Political institutions have potentially important economic consequences and can affect both the dynamic performance of an economy, that is, how efficiently wealth is created, as well as how wealth is distributed in the society. If all power is concentrated in the hands of a narrow minority, then the political system will likely serve that minority’s interests. If, on the other hand, power is distributed more equally, then political decisions will have to be more inclusive and take into account the interests of many different groups. Because of the way political institutions allocate political power, they are critical to understanding a country’s success or failure in terms of economic development. Different institutions can have conflicting interests in an economy’s development. Some will benefit from growth, while others will promote barriers to market entry and development. In this chapter, we explain the principal differences between the various types of democracies and autocracies, and discuss their effects on economic development. We also discuss the processes of democratization, or how countries come to overthrow an autocratic regime and establish a democracy in its place, and what are the difficulties presented by these processes. Political Regimes The two main types of political regimes are democracies and dictatorships or autocracies. The word autocracy is preferable to the word dictatorship because it includes the different types of nondemocratic regimes. Although autocracy is defined as a government in which all power resides in a single person such as a dictator, monarch, or supreme religious leader. The word democracy comes from ancient Greek and means “power of the people.” Today, democracies are representative governments with political leaders who are selected through free, fair, and competitive elections in which all adult citizens have the right to vote and all political parties have the right to participate in elections and governance. Democracy is founded on the premise that all citizens enjoy fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom of movement. Freedom House, headquartered in Washington, DC, is a nongovernmental organization that publishes an annual report on the status of freedom and democracy around the world. Freedom House lists a number of conditions that a country must satisfy to be called an “electoral democracy”: •± a competitive multiparty electoral system; •± universal adult suffrage; •± regularly conducted elections with ballot secrecy, ballot security, and absence of fraud; and •± for political parties, significant public access to the electorate through the media and through open political campaigning.

Political Institutions Theories of Democratization Researchers have put forward many theories of democratization. This section examines only those theories that emphasize a few key variables as determinants of democracy. In other words, we will use the usual economics method of trying to isolate a few important variables while ignoring the rest. Reality is complex and it is better to have theories that are incomplete but that capture the most important variables and their effects. Income and Democracy Political scientist Seymour Lipset has proposed one of the oldest and most famous theories of democratization. 6 He noticed a correlation between income and democracy and suggested that as countries become richer, they tend to adopt a democratic system. Figure 7 plots the log of income per worker in 2000 on the horizontal axis and the Polity IV index of democracy on the vertical axis. It shows that a positive correlation exists. Countries that have a higher income per capita tend to be more democratic, while poorer countries tend to be less democratic. As Figure 7 illustrates, there are also a few exceptions: Singapore, Libya, and the oil-exporting Persian Gulf states (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates) have a high level of income per capita and a low democracy score. This strong international correlation between income per capita and democracy has been the basis for one of the best-known theories in the social sciences that posits a causal relationship between development and democracy. Lipset’s argument is that as a society modernizes and develops economically, its urbanization rate increases, the level of education rises, and the complexity of social processes increases. As a consequence of these modernization processes, the demand for democracy on the part of the educated masses increases. More economically developed countries should, therefore, have a greater demand for democracy and, on average, should be more democratic. This theory has found significant support among economists, including the famous macro-economist Robert Barro. 7 Political scientist Adam Przeworski and his co-authors claim that the positive correlation between income and democracy is mainly driven by the fact that richer countries remain democratic, whereas poorer countries have more fragile democracies and, as a result, have experienced military coups and reversals of democracy. 8 These reversals have also been taking place in countries with a less extensive history of democracy; that is, in countries that belong to the second wave of democratization. 6 Seymour M.

Political Institutions While democracy provides a credible commitment to income redistribution, its success can prove more fragile in societies with higher income inequality because a coup could bring down a nascent democracy. Acemoglu and Robinson’s theory of democratization enables us to make several predictions. First, an improved level of civil society development should lead to earlier democratization with fewer reversals. Better civil society development means that the citizens are more organized in various associations, political parties, unions, etc. In other words, citizens increase their ability to overcome collectiveaction problems. As a result, the bargaining power of citizens with the elite is stronger and the elite are more inclined to make concessions to avert a revolutionary threat. For similar reasons, the costs of staging a coup when civil society is well developed are much higher. Early democratization and a stable democracy are therefore more likely in countries where civil society is more developed. Second, there is an increased likelihood that democratization will occur in times of crisis, such as economic recession, bad harvests, financial emergencies, etc. Typically, these are events that not only result in revolutionary movements but in the democratization that is likely to occur as a response. Crises are also situations that lend themselves to coups d’état. The elite might be more easily convinced to unite behind a dictator, because national crises might justify the necessity of drastic policies to restore stability. Third, in countries where the wealth of the elite derives primarily from land ownership rather than from industrial capital, democratization is less likely to occur. If it does, it is less likely to be stable. There are several reasons for this. First, land is easier to tax than physical or human capital. Landowners have more to fear from redistributive taxation because they cannot hide their land assets. Second, repression and social turbulence are more costly for industrial and human capital than for landowners. Repression is never very efficient as a method to compel people to work, but it is even less efficient for skilled human capital. Agricultural laborers can be forced to work the land, but talented and skilled workers cannot be made to work efficiently under the threat of force. Similar to the captive scientists in spy movies, skilled workers can always make a minimum effort more easily than unskilled workers. Third, while angry mobs can destroy physical capital, they cannot actually destroy land. The costs of social conflict are thus smaller for the landed elite than for the industrial and urban elite. Therefore, democratization is more likely in societies where the assets of the elite are mostly industrial rather than agrarian. Because the agrarian elite have fewer incentives to make concessions, revolutions are more likely to occur in countries in which they control the wealth. This was the case in Russia, China, Vietnam, Cuba, and Nicaragua. For the same reasons, coups are less costly in countries with an agrarian elite, and thus democracy is less likely to be stable. A fourth prediction suggests that democratization is less likely with either very low or very high levels of inequality. In very equal societies, the elite might be more willing to make concessions, but citizens will have less reason to revolt. In very unequal societies, citizens will have ample reasons to revolt, but the elite will have a lot to lose and are thus more likely to resist democratization. It is in societies where inequality is intermediate that we are more likely to witness democratization followed by a stable democratic government.

First, an improved level of civil society development should lead to earlier democratization with fewer reversals. Better civil society development means that the citizens are more organized in various associations, political parties, unions, etc. In other words, citizens increase their ability to overcome collectiveaction problems. As a result, the bargaining power of citizens with the elite is stronger and the elite are more inclined to make concessions to avert a revolutionary threat. For similar reasons, the costs of staging a coup when civil society is well developed are much higher. Early democratization and a stable democracy are therefore more likely in countries where civil society is more developed. Second, there is an increased likelihood that democratization will occur in times of crisis, such as economic recession, bad harvests, financial emergencies, etc. Typically, these are events that not only result in revolutionary movements but in the democratization that is likely to occur as a response. Crises are also situations that lend themselves to coups d’état. The elite might be more easily convinced to unite behind a dictator, because national crises might justify the necessity of drastic policies to restore stability. Third, in countries where the wealth of the elite derives primarily from land ownership rather than from industrial capital, democratization is less likely to occur. If it does, it is less likely to be stable. There are several reasons for this. First, land is easier to tax than physical or human capital. Landowners have more to fear from redistributive taxation because they cannot hide their land assets. Second, repression and social turbulence are more costly for industrial and human capital than for landowners. Repression is never very efficient as a method to compel people to work, but it is even less efficient for skilled human capital. Agricultural laborers can be forced to work the land, but talented and skilled workers cannot be made to work efficiently under the threat of force. Similar to the captive scientists in spy movies, skilled workers can always make a minimum effort more easily than unskilled workers. Third, while angry mobs can destroy physical capital, they cannot actually destroy land. The costs of social conflict are thus smaller for the landed elite than for the industrial and urban elite. Therefore, democratization is more likely in societies where the assets of the elite are mostly industrial rather than agrarian. Because the agrarian elite have fewer incentives to make concessions, revolutions are more likely to occur in countries in which they control the wealth. This was the case in Russia, China, Vietnam, Cuba, and Nicaragua. For the same reasons, coups are less costly in countries with an agrarian elite, and thus democracy is less likely to be stable. A fourth prediction suggests that democratization is less likely with either very low or very high levels of inequality. In very equal societies, the elite might be more willing to make concessions, but citizens will have less reason to revolt. In very unequal societies, citizens will have ample reasons to revolt, but the elite will have a lot to lose and are thus more likely to resist democratization. It is in societies where inequality is intermediate that we are more likely to witness democratization followed by a stable democratic government. 


Political Institutions The beauty of democracy is that elections provide an institutional solution to this collective-action problem. One often overlooked difference between democracy and autocracy is the issue of secession. Autocracies tend to expand their borders, while democracies tend to experience regional secessions. Shortly after India became independent and democratic in 1947, Pakistan seceded from it and Bangladesh later seceded from Pakistan in 1971. Secession occurred in many other countries after decolonization—Eritrea, Rwanda, and Burundi are just a few examples. When Communism collapsed and democracy was introduced in Eastern Europe, former Soviet republics such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine seceded, while some Soviet-bloc countries such as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were broken into smaller countries. Dictators tend to expand their territories because the greater the area over which they have control, the more taxable revenues they can appropriate. Why do democracies tend to experience secession? In a democracy, there are costs and benefits to secession, which voters usually understand equally as well as they recognize the advantage of voting for one candidate over the other. The main advantages of secession are that it a) limits the amount of income redistribution across geographical units, and b) reduces heterogeneity or diversity in voter preferences. If a country has both rich and poor regions, income redistribution will tend to be seen as redistribution from richer to poorer regions. By seceding, citizens in a rich region stop the flow of redistribution toward poorer regions. The poorer regions do not benefit from secession, but they usually cannot prevent a rich region from seceding unless they are able to mount a credible threat of violence. Different preferences for redistribution are simply a manifestation of heterogeneity in voter preferences. Suppose a country with two regions inhabited by groups that differ either in their ethnicity, religion, or income. If one region is larger than the other in terms of population, it is likely that region will dominate politically. The minority region would get a large political benefit from seceding because in the new country, it would be a majority with policies more aligned to its preferences. Even if the two regions are more or less equal in size, the country would be hard to govern and political compromises would constantly have to be found. These compromises would not be accepted in either region, and a majority in each region might decide that they are better off seceding. Democracy is often imperfect at protecting the rights of minorities. However, if minorities are concentrated in well-defined geographical areas, they can escape oppression by seceding. They could attempt this in an autocracy, but they would be virtually guaranteed to be met with significant and sometimes forceful opposition by the established regime. For example, a majority in Tibet would likely want to secede from China, but the Chinese government would immediately send in its troops to prevent such a secession. In a democracy, if secession is organized peacefully after a popular referendum, opposition is less likely, though not impossible. However, secession also has costs. First, retaliation by the original country is possible. It could be a military response or it could take more subtle forms such as barriers to trade or to free movement of people across borders. A second possible cost is the loss

Institutions and Economic Development promising a high price once the crop was mature. The farmer changes crops, and for the first year, harvests cacao beans from which cocoa is produced. If the food company comes back and offers a lower price for the crop, the farmer is still forced to sell to the food company or face the loss of an entire year’s income. Another example occurs in the rental market. If a farmer who is leasing land from a landlord has made significant efforts to improve the productivity of the land by building irrigation systems using his own money and effort, he may be evicted by the landlord, who can charge a higher price to other farmers because of the improvements, or can threaten to evict the farmer unless he agrees to an increase in the rental price. The hold-up problem is more acute the more relationship specific the investment is. In the axle example, the investment to produce axles only has value when the subcontractor sells the axles to the specific truck manufacturing company. When an investment only has value in the context of a specific partnership with another firm, this relationship specificity is also called asset specificity . If the axle producer can sell the same axles to another truck company, the hold-up problem is solved because there are alternative uses for the investment. If the truck manufacturer knows this, he may refrain from trying to lower the price after the investment is made. Even if the axles are specific to a particular contract, the hold-up problem might still be mitigated if the prior investment can be restructured at a relatively low cost for alternative uses. Suppose that the subcontractor producing the axles can restructure his facility to produce metal parts for the construction industry; he might opt to do that instead of submitting to the demands of the truck manufacturer to lower the price of the axles. Note that the hold-up problem is not related to informational asymmetries. The axle producer knows that the truck manufacturer will have an interest in holding it up. The hold-up problem is related to asset-specificity, the sunk cost of investment and opportunistic behavior. Institutional solutions to the hold-up problem. Binding and legally enforceable contracts are the primary solution to the hold-up problem. If the buyer is contractually obligated to buy products from the subcontractor at a specified price, the problem should disappear. Countries with strong legal institutions have an advantage over countries with weak institutions in terms of the holdup problem. However, legal institutions do not always provide full protection against hold-ups. Because contracts are often incomplete and lack specific details, it is often possible for a buyer to invoke a contingency that was not built into the initial contract and lay the blame on the seller. One tactic is to claim that certain characteristics of a product that were not actually specified in the contract are not as initially agreed upon. Many of these claims are often not very credible, but it can be costly to mount a defense against them in court. The truck manufacturer can threaten the axle subcontractor with legal proceedings unless the axles’ price is renegotiated downward, and the subcontractor may not have the resources to defend himself. Between the costs of a lower axle price and the cost of a lawsuit, the subcontractor may choose the lower axle price. The less detailed the contract, the more possibilities there are for hold-up.

Structural Change and Development Strategies where w A would have to be equal to w min in order to leave agricultural workers indifferent because no one moving to the city would be unemployed. Point M is thus on the mob curve. Now increase L URB by moving toward the left in Figure 5b. Because L M * is fixed, there is now a positive probability of not finding a job in the city. Therefore, workers in agriculture would be willing to stay in agriculture at a wage w A below w min and be indifferent to moving or not. The more L URB increases, the more unemployment there will be and the lower the w A that keeps workers in agriculture indifferent. Therefore, the mob curve slopes downward. In the migration equilibrium, workers in agriculture do not want to move, but labor supply and labor demand in agriculture are also equal. This is the intersection between the mob curve and the demand curve for agricultural labor, or point I. It is important to remember that point I is the point where the wage in agriculture is such that all those who stay in agriculture remain employed and are indifferent to leaving versus staying. This wage is w A * in Figure 5b. Note that in the equilibrium, there is unemployment in the urban sector as equilibrium urban population L URB * is larger than L M * . The Harris- Todaro model predicts the joint possibility of migration and unemployment (or employment in the informal sector with wages close to zero). In the context of the model, the higher the level of w min , the more attractive an urban job will be, resulting in a higher probability of unemployment. The Implications of the Harris-Todaro Model Contrary to the Lewis model of structural change that we found did not fit the reality of most developing countries, the Harris-Todaro model currently remains the most convincing theory for understanding the most common patterns of rural to urban migration in developing countries. Several important implications of the Harris-Todaro model underscore the complexities of that migration. Excess migration. The Harris-Todaro model indicates that there will be excess migration because free mobility, combined with wage rigidity in urban areas, leads to urban unemployment in equilibrium. Thus, the high urbanization rates that we have seen in the world in the last decades are not necessarily a sign of healthy economic development. They may, to a large extent, reflect excess migration. Urban planning. Excess migration has consequences for urban planning. Too many migrants from the countryside create congestion in terms of the provision of public services such as health, education, and various types of infrastructure. In other words, they contribute to crowding in hospitals and schools, and on roads and other forms of transportation. Adverse effects of rural education. The Harris-Todaro model implies that rural education programs may have adverse effects. We generally tend to see a high level of education in rural areas as a good thing. However, the Harris-Todaro model indicates that this can lead to increased migration to the cities and to higher urban unemployment. Rural youth who have received an

Political Institutions How does this theory relate to different kinds of autocracies? A dictator expecting to be in power for a long time will behave like a stationary bandit, whereas dictators whose power is unstable will behave more like roving bandits. If we assume that the dictator sets taxes not only to finance his private consumption but also to finance public services, what level of services would a dictator provide by behaving like a stationary bandit? From the point of view of the dictator’s own interests, he should provide public services only to the extent that it will lead to a future increase in taxable revenues that will be higher than the revenue that is lost today. The dictator will not take into account the public’s preferences for those services. Nevertheless, the dictator’s interests might be partially aligned with those of the population. The Egyptian pharaohs and the Chinese emperors not only spent a large part of tax revenues on their palaces, pyramids, mausoleums, armies, and court administrations, but also on irrigation and water management systems that helped increase agricultural productivity. They did this because higher agricultural output would yield higher tax revenues. the objective function of the stationary bandit: ty 1 + b f [(1 t ) y 1 ]. If t = 0, the objective function is f ( y 1 ) assumed larger than y 1 . If t = 1, the objective function is y 1 . The optimum is reached when the slope of the curve is equal to zero, that is, for t* which is strictly 6 1. Note that a reduction in the discount rate b , implying a higher impatience, leads to a higher t* because we value even more the present relative to the future. Also, an upward shift of the function f that transforms today’s net income into net future income leads to a lower t*. FIGURE 3 The Stationary Bandit’s Optimization Problem 0 1 y 1 t * Tax rate t Present value of total income Present value of total income for the stationary bandit first increases as the period 1 tax rate increases, but it decreases once it has reached t*. This is because once the tax rate becomes high enough, higher period 1 tax revenues are more than offset by lower period 2 revenues.

Political Institutions Right-wing dictatorships. During the Cold War (1945-1989), when the principal geopolitical tensions in the world were between Communist and capitalist countries, a number of right-wing dictatorships emerged in developing countries, primarily in Latin America and Africa. These regimes were not ideologically driven; they had no blueprints for remaking society. They usually relied on repression and U.S. subsidies to stay in power. In the strange logic of the Cold War, the U.S. government supported all right-wing military dictatorships that were staunchly anti-Communist and could prove that they were able to repress left-wing rebellions in their countries. In the 1970s, most Latin American countries were headed by military dictators such as General Augusto Pinochet in Chili, who violently toppled the leftwing government of Salvador Allende in 1973, and General Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina, who was extremely repressive and routinely killed his left-wing opponents. In Brazil, a military dictatorship was in power between 1964 and 1985. Paraguay was governed by the dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner between 1954 and 1989. Military dictators ruled Bolivia between 1964 and 1978, Uruguay between 1973 and 1985, Honduras between 1972 and 1982, and Peru between 1968 and 1980. In Africa, the Mobutu Sese Seko regime in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire) was known both for its longevity (1965-1997) and for its widespread corruption and inept governance. However, Mobutu was a staunch ally of the United States against Soviet influence on the continent and probably the most loyal ally the United States had in Africa. From 1967 to 1998, Indonesia was ruled by the dictatorship of General Suharto. He came to power by staging a military coup followed by a repressive campaign in which at least 500,000 opponents were slaughtered. Virtually all of these military dictatorships disappeared after the end of the Cold War, which underscores how critical U.S. support was for their survival. Many if not most of these regimes were utterly corrupt. In the economic sector, the regimes would protect the interests of the families and friends of those in power, favoring established firms and opposing competition and transparency. A number of right-wing dictatorships in the post-World War II period, such as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea, were characterized by aggressive pro-business policies. Following the example of Japan, these regimes encouraged export-led growth in Asia that resulted in significant economic success, several decades before China embarked on its impressive path toward economic growth. They were typically less corrupt than many other right-wing dictatorships and placed great value on reaching high rates of development. They actually score better than most other countries on international indicators of the quality of the rule of law. Waves of Democratization Democratization is very much a 20th-century phenomenon. Samuel Huntington has observed that the world has experienced three waves of democratization. 5 Table 2 regroups countries by their last wave of democratization and the year in which it occurred (not counting invasions by foreign countries). 5 Samuel P. Huntington, The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century (Oklahoma City, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1991).

Structural Change and Development Strategies has developed a vigorous service sector that has become the economy’s main source of growth. The growth of Indian call centers, in which employees answer service calls from all around the world, has mushroomed. Call center employees work around the clock, taking phone calls from all time zones: Australia in the morning, the United Kingdom and Europe in the evening, and the United States at night. India’s software-producing sector is also developing rapidly; software engineers are writing computer code for companies all around the world. Structural Change across Industrial Sectors There are other, more modest, types of structural changes, such as shifts across industrial sectors. For example, South Korea has been moving in the direction of high-tech industry, following in the footsteps of Japan. In the 1960s, South Korea was specializing in capital-intensive, low-technology industries such as steel and chemicals, while Japan was moving toward the automobile and electronics industries. Since the 1980s and 1990s, however, South Korea has also developed strong automobile and electronics industries. Shifts to hightech industry and to the service sector usually take place during later stages of development, while the shift from a predominantly agricultural to a predominantly industrial economy is the most important structural change at earlier stages of development. FIGURE 1 The Percentage Share of China’s Agricultural Labor Force, 1978-2011 Share of agricultural labor force in China 55 197 8 198 0 198 2 198 4 198 6 198 8 199 0 199 2 199 4 199 6 199 8 200 0 200 2 200 4 200 6 200 8 201 0 80 75 70 65 60 The share of China’s agricultural labor force has been continuously declining since 1978 as millions of workers have left farms and rural villages for employment in the manufacturing sector.

Political Institutions these promises may not be credible. In most cases, revolutionary threats do not last very long. People cannot demonstrate and strike indefinitely. Once the mobilization cools down and people return to their ordinary activities, the elite may renege on their promises to redistribute income or may cease to keep their promises and curtail the redistributive programs they implemented under a revolutionary threat. It would be in their best interests to do so because such policies are very costly. There would be a very good chance that the elite could get away with this breach of commitment because it is unlikely that citizens could remobilize quickly and revive a revolutionary threat. Promises of redistribution would therefore not be enough to calm the revolutionary fervor and protect the assets of the elite from expropriation. It is here that democracy plays a key role. Democracy as a commitment to redistribution. The introduction of democracy presents a credible way to promise redistribution while simultaneously preventing a revolution. Democracy gives formal political power to citizens. Even after the revolutionary mobilization has subsided, elections make it possible to vote for redistributive programs without the necessity of solving the multiple collective-action problems associated with organizing a revolutionary movement. Because expropriating the assets of the elite through a revolution is costly for the populace because it prevents capital accumulation and growth, democracy offers as a practical solution that benefits both the elite and the citizens in the event of a revolutionary threat.

Political Institutions and which make the difference between having a majority versus a minority of seats. In the extreme, the party might put all its effort into winning the one district that could deliver a majority of seats. Trying to please voters in districts that will deliver safe seats would not make sense, as this would deliver more votes but not more seats. Similarly, it does not make political sense to spend resources in districts sure to be won by other parties. Political incentives are different in the case of proportional elections. As the share of seats is proportional to the share of votes, a party will try to please as many voters as possible. It makes no sense to concentrate only on certain categories of voters, as it is possible to gain more seats by appealing to a broader share of the electorate. The incentives of politicians are thus different under the two different electoral rules. What does this difference in incentives mean in terms of fiscal policy? Under majoritarian elections, politicians will pay more attention to local public services that benefit only the voters in the districts that are relevant to winning an election. Under proportional elections, they will pay more attention to services that benefit the largest possible number of voters. As a result, social welfare spending will be greater in the latter category. Politicians in majoritarian systems have fewer incentives to spend on social welfare programs that are not targeted to a specific electoral district. Spending one more dollar per person is more costly for social welfare or pensions because more people will benefit from it in the majoritarian system. The results are greater and less costly when spending higher sums on the swing voters in the marginal districts. This may explain why countries with proportional elections spend more on social welfare than countries with majoritarian elections. Political Institutions in an Autocracy Turning to nondemocratic regimes, or autocracies, which currently exist only in developing countries, their various types are distinguished by the interests they represent, the ideology they defend, and among other characteristics, their rules for the succession of leadership. Communist Regimes In 1917, a Communist regime came to power in Russia; after World War II, similar regimes appeared in Eastern Europe, China, and parts of Asia (Mongolia, North Vietnam, and North Korea). Cuba established a Communist regime shortly after Fidel Castro’s revolutionaries overthrew the right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Communist regimes are characterized by the oneparty rule, suppression of democratic freedoms, and an economic system with central planning and government ownership of economic assets. These systems were founded on Communist ideology, which claimed that central planning and redirecting a society’s focus on individualism toward collectivism would lead to larger economic prosperity than would capitalism. Political repression was considered necessary to fight attempts by capitalist regimes to destroy Communism. With their intense ideology, Communist regimes became totalitarian in the sense that they sought to influence and control all aspects of citizens’ lives. Children were encouraged to denounce their parents if they heard any “counterrevolutionary” thoughts expressed at home. 


Political Institutions In other countries, decolonization also took place as a response to the development of radical anticolonial revolutionary movements that threatened to expropriate colonial interests. But decolonization did not necessarily result in democratization. In Algeria, for example, a nationalist one-party rule was instituted after the French left the country in the aftermath of a very bloody colonial war. Democratization and income inequality. While we know that the elite may accept democratization and even propose it in response to revolutionary threats, we still have not addressed why there should be more democratization when income inequality is lower. Acemoglu and Robinson’s theory also provides an answer to that question. We have seen that democracy was overthrown in some countries. Many military coups d’état have abolished democracy and introduced a military dictatorship that favors the interests of the elite. But coups do not happen overnight; just as revolutionary threats do not arise every day, the political and military conditions necessary for mounting a successful coup must be present and a sufficiently large number of the elite must be in favor of it. Moreover, coups are very costly. They may fail, in which case the result could be disastrous for the elite. Those who organized the failed attempt might lose their lives or land in prison. The reaction to an attempted overthrow of the existing government would almost surely lead to retaliatory measures against the elite, leading to expropriation of their assets and privileges. Even when a coup is successful, it is costly to consolidate and maintain, as very strong repression measures must be put in place. Given the fact that coups are costly, they occur more often in those cases where the benefits of staging them are larger. In societies where inequality is significant and where democracy may lead to severe redistributive outcomes, the elite may benefit more from a coup to prevent or undo those outcomes. In more egalitarian societies, the costs of organizing a coup might outweigh the benefits. Therefore, coups and reversals of democracy are more likely to occur in societies where inequality is greater. The elite in countries where inequality is significant might also resist democratization more. Instead of making concessions, they might gamble on repression in the hope that revolutionary movements would be thwarted. While this is not always the case, revolutions are more likely in countries with greater inequality. Kaiser Wilhelm II rather than against the French and English. The threat of revolution played a major role in the political upheaval that subsequently took place in Germany. Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated, the Weimar Republic was established, and the war ended for Germany. Workers were given voting rights, while the leaders of the Spartacist movement, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, were assassinated in the streets of Berlin by a group of veterans who were members of a paramilitary unit. In Europe, the spirit of the times after World War I was such that the elite were terrified by the prospect of the Communist revolution expanding worldwide, a goal that the Russian Marxists were actively supporting. In other countries such as Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden, voting rights were dramatically extended to make concessions to the working class and prevent a revolution that would expropriate the assets and privileges of their elites.

Until the urban sector can provide jobs at the same pace as rural children receive an education, many educated rural youth will move to the cities and face unemployment. Higher unemployment. It would seem that the creation of urban jobs would be the simple answer to high urban unemployment. The government, possibly with the help of international aid organizations, could create new jobs in the public sector or encourage the creation of jobs through public spending programs, subsidies, and tax cuts for enterprises hiring urban labor. Unfortunately, job creation programs can actually lead to more unemployment. For every position created in urban areas, many new immigrants will migrate from the countryside with the hope that an urban employer will hire them for that position. The total number of unemployed in the cities may rise as new jobs are created. In other words, job creation programs intended to decrease unemployment might actually cause unemployment to increase. Rural to urban migration policy. The Harris-Todaro model’s findings of excess migration and high unemployment show the complexities of dealing China’s agricultural reforms of 1978, which replaced collective ownership of land with the “Household Responsibility System” (whereby households could sign 15-year land leases) significantly increased the efficiency of agricultural production. This made it possible to release the excessive labor that existed in the countryside. The surplus labor generated by the reforms was first absorbed by so-called “township village enterprises” (TVEs), small industrial firms or workshops owned by local governments. The TVEs were the main engine of growth in the Chinese economy in the 1980s and early 1990s, and brought relative affluence to the countryside in the first phase of reforms. The employment opportunities provided by the TVEs prevented many rural Chinese workers from looking for work in urban areas. In addition to the TVEs, Chinese policy severely restricted internal migration. Under the rigid household registration system called hukou , rural residents were required to register with local authorities and they did not have the right to become urban residents even when they lived and worked in a city. The hukou system was a policy specifically designed to prevent rural to urban migration. In practice, many people have ignored the migration prohibitions. Millions of illegal migrants have filled the cities and augmented the urban and informal labor forces. Illegal migration to the cities continued to increase throughout the 1980s, but since the 1990s, the government has eased the policy restrictions and it has become somewhat easier for a rural resident to obtain an urban residency permit. These permits are temporary and they often come at a very high price (in the Beijing area, they cost around $10,000, more than 5 times an urban worker’s annual average salary). Without residency permits, migrant workers do not have access to social services, health care, or schools for their children, and police can deport any illegal migrants back to the countryside. These illegal migrants have become secondclass citizens who resent their pariah status. China’s Internal Immigration Policy

Political Institutions The Theory of Autocracy Mancur Olson introduced a useful distinction that we can apply to the characteristics of an autocracy: the difference between a roving bandit and a stationary bandit. 2 A roving bandit moves from place to place and plunders what he can wherever he goes. Because he will not come back to the same place, he does not care about the damage he inflicts. He will steal what he can, whatever the consequences for the local economy. A stationary bandit does not have higher ethical standards than the roving bandit, but he always steals within the same geographical entity. When stealing today, the stationary bandit must take into account that he still needs to steal in the same area tomorrow. Therefore, it is in his best interest to leave people enough so that he can continue to steal from them in the future. In the box that follows, we present a simple model of the roving and the stationary bandit in which stealing takes places through taxation. It illustrates that an economy with a roving bandit will do poorly and will not develop, while an economy with a stationary bandit will do better. The stationary bandit will steal today up to the point where the marginal benefit from a higher tax rate (one more unit of revenue from today’s income) equals the marginal cost (the decrease in tomorrow’s tax revenues). Both kinds of bandits want to maximize the revenue they get from stealing, but the stationary bandit seeks to maximize not only current revenue but revenue over time. 2 Mancur Olson, “Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development,” American Political Science Review 87, no. 3 (1993): 567-576. To better understand the roving and stationary bandits, we study a two-period model. In the first period, the economy yields output y 1 . A proportion t of y 1 is plundered. In the second period, output is a function of the remaining output: y 2 = f [(1 t ) y 1 ] where f is a concave function of (1 t ) y 1 . It is assumed that the derivative of that function estimated at zero f H ( ) = h . Note that if t = 0, y 2 = f ( y 1 ), and if t = 1, then it is assumed that f ( ) = 0. At the end of the second period, all the output can be plundered. Calling b the discount rate, that is, the rate at which the future is discounted relative to the present, the roving bandit who stays only in period 1 will be interested in maximizing ty 1 , whereas the stationary bandit who will be there for both periods plunders part of the output in period 1 and gets to plunder all the output in period 2. In other words, the stationary bandit will be interested in maximizing ty 1 + b y 2 = ty 1 + b f [(1 t ) y 1 ]. The roving bandit, then, will choose t = 1. To find the preferred tax rate of the stationary bandit, we take the derivative of the objective function with respect to t and set it equal to zero: y 1 b y 1 f H [(1 t ) y 1 ] = 0 or b f H [(1 t ) y 1 ] = 1, which will always lead to an optimal choice of t 6 1 because f H ( ) = h . Figure 3 shows the maximization problem of the stationary bandit and the optimal solution. The plundering rate t is on the horizontal axis, and the curve depicts A Model of the Roving and Stationary Bandits 


Political Institutions When tropical cyclone Nargis hit the Asian nation of Myanmar (formerly Burma) in May 2008, the country experienced its worst-ever natural disaster. Large areas of the low-lying nation were flooded by torrential rains and storm surge, and landslides occurred in many places as a result of unstable water-logged hillsides. As many as 138,000 people may have been killed. What was particularly devastating about the catastrophe is that many lives could have been saved if Myanmar’s military government had allowed international aid to enter the country. Food and medical supplies came from all over the world in reaction to the news of the Myanmar floods, as did doctors, nurses, and aid workers who volunteered to fly in to rescue the thousands of people whose lives were threatened. But the Myanmar military dictatorship denied entry visas to those aid workers and refused to let the aid supplies into the country. The international community was shocked at the regime’s lack of compassion toward its own people, which may have caused tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. Compare this to the government reaction to the 1984 industrial disaster in Bhopal, India, one of the world’s largest to date. A Union Carbide pesticide plant accidentally released an estimated 42 tons of toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other potentially harmful chemicals. The international community had very little knowledge of how to cope with such a major environmental disaster and given the lack of experience with accidents of this type, the Indian government’s response, both at the central and local levels, was less than optimal. Nevertheless, the solidarity of the response within India and across the world was immediate. The medical and scientific communities mobilized rapidly. Hospitals and medical and social services were quickly established at the scene. An international medical commission was empowered to investigate all aspects of the disaster; ultimately, its recommendations for reform were communicated to the Indian government, its citizens, and to the surviving victims. If a similar disaster had happened in Myanmar, the scope of the catastrophe could have been many times greater and thousands more lives could have been lost. Political institutions are very important for economic development. The difference in disaster responses mentioned above illustrates only one of the differences between autocracy (or dictatorship) in Myanmar versus India’s democracy. Although there are many kinds of democracies, there are even more types of autocracies—all of which can have very different effects on economic development. For example, the nondemocratic regime of Singapore, where the rule of law is respected and the market economy thrives, and the North Korean Communist dictatorship, where there is no rule of law and the state prohibits private business, have very little in common. It is therefore important to make clear distinctions between the different kinds of both democracies and autocracies.

Political Institutions The problem with the international correlation between income and democracy is that it does not prove any causality between the two. It only shows that richer countries are generally more democratic than poorer countries. It could be the case that an underlying variable, such as culture or religion, affects both the political institutions and economic development. For example, Max Weber, in his famous book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, 9 argued that Protestantism was behind both democracy and economic development. In contrast, economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James Robinson, and Pierre Yared show that there is no good evidence that as a country gets richer, it becomes more democratic. 10 Figure 8 shows the correlation between the change in income from 1970 to 1995 on the horizontal axis and the change in the Polity IV measure of democracy during the same period. There is no correlation. The relation appears to be flat. In other words, richer countries are more democratic, but there is no good evidence that as a country becomes richer, it becomes more democratic.

Both kinds of bandits want to maximize the revenue they get from stealing, but the stationary bandit seeks to maximize not only current revenue but revenue over time. 2 Mancur Olson, “Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development,” American Political Science Review 87, no. 3 (1993): 567-576. To better understand the roving and stationary bandits, we study a two-period model. In the first period, the economy yields output y 1 . A proportion t of y 1 is plundered. In the second period, output is a function of the remaining output: y 2 = f [(1 t ) y 1 ] where f is a concave function of (1 t ) y 1 . It is assumed that the derivative of that function estimated at zero f H ( ) = h . Note that if t = 0, y 2 = f ( y 1 ), and if t = 1, then it is assumed that f ( ) = 0. At the end of the second period, all the output can be plundered. Calling b the discount rate, that is, the rate at which the future is discounted relative to the present, the roving bandit who stays only in period 1 will be interested in maximizing ty 1 , whereas the stationary bandit who will be there for both periods plunders part of the output in period 1 and gets to plunder all the output in period 2. In other words, the stationary bandit will be interested in maximizing ty 1 + b y 2 = ty 1 + b f [(1 t ) y 1 ]. The roving bandit, then, will choose t = 1. To find the preferred tax rate of the stationary bandit, we take the derivative of the objective function with respect to t and set it equal to zero: y 1 b y 1 f H [(1 t ) y 1 ] = 0 or b f H [(1 t ) y 1 ] = 1, which will always lead to an optimal choice of t 6 1 because f H ( ) = h . Figure 3 shows the maximization problem of the stationary bandit and the optimal solution. The plundering rate t is on the horizontal axis, and the curve depicts A Model of the Roving and Stationary Bandits 


Political Institutions Inequality, Social Conflict, and Democracy Other theories of democratization link it to income inequality. The median voter theory of democracy tells us that a more inegalitarian society will have more wealth redistribution compared to a less inegalitarian society. In the more inegalitarian society, the rich have therefore more to lose from the introduction of democracy because there would be more redistribution. Because they have more to lose, the rich in the more inegalitarian society would resist the introduction of democracy more. Why, then, might the rich accept democracy in a less inegalitarian society when they would also lose from redistributive policies? Acemoglu and Robinson have formulated a theory of democratization that answers this question. 12 Take as starting point a nondemocratic regime. Imagine that its citizens have organized and are able to overthrow the existing elite and expropriate their assets through a revolution. Historically, these revolutionary movements have mobilized millions of people to demonstrate in the streets and demand fundamental changes, as was the case with the Arab Spring in 2011. These events are usually not predictable and usually do not last very long. How can the elite react to a revolutionary threat? They can be passive and allow the complete expropriation of their wealth, or they can promise redistribution of income to the poor and to public welfare programs such as governmentfunded education and health services that benefit the poor. The problem is that 12 Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006).

Political Institutions The problem with the international correlation between income and democracy is that it does not prove any causality between the two. It only shows that richer countries are generally more democratic than poorer countries. It could be the case that an underlying variable, such as culture or religion, affects both the political institutions and economic development. For example, Max Weber, in his famous book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, 9 argued that Protestantism was behind both democracy and economic development. In contrast, economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James Robinson, and Pierre Yared show that there is no good evidence that as a country gets richer, it becomes more democratic. 10 Figure 8 shows the correlation between the change in income from 1970 to 1995 on the horizontal axis and the change in the Polity IV measure of democracy during the same period. There is no correlation. The relation appears to be flat. In other words, richer countries are more democratic, but there is no good evidence that as a country becomes richer, it becomes more democratic. Education and Democracy Another version of the modernization theory identifies education as the key condition that leads to democracy. It suggests that a minimum level of 10 Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, ( New York: Penguin Books 2002). 9 Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James A.

Political Institutions programs, but the only motivation would be fear of a popular uprising that could overthrow the regime. Such uprisings are, however, rare. Democracies and autocracies also differ in terms of the provision of public services. An autocratic regime will only fund public services to the extent that the investment brings in more tax revenues to the dictator than direct taxation would. In contrast, a democracy is much more dependable in terms of providing public services, as political decisions take into account the interests of at least a majority of voters. Before the advent of democracy, the primary public expenditures of autocratic regimes were for the military and the police, as well as those funds directed to the construction of palaces and statues that benefited those in power. Democracy offers basic public services, such as education and health, which benefit the population at large and redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor. A democracy and an autocracy also often differ in a number of other critical aspects related to economic development. In autocratic countries, a small group of elites usually controls a large part of the country’s wealth and productive assets. The elite will tend to use the political regime to perpetuate its economic control and privileges by discouraging both the entry of new firms into the economy and market competition, favoring instead to erect barriers to market entry via laws and regulations. In contrast, in a democracy, while special interests and political lobbies generally favor established firms, there are also countervailing tendencies as consumers favor market competition and low prices, and small and medium enterprises favor low costs of entry into the economy. The two forms of government also often differ in terms of social mobility. The elite in autocratic regimes want to perpetuate themselves by securing positions within the ruling elite for their offspring, therefore restricting access to those positions by anyone else. The elite favors erecting barriers to social mobility that often take subtle forms and are based on prejudice. Sometimes social barriers to mobility can represent outright discrimination, denying certain ethnic or social groups access to specific professions. Another significant contrast between democracy and autocracy lies in the accountability of the executive and other elected representatives, one of the most important principles of a democracy. Elected leaders may make mistakes (sometimes serious), they may appear incompetent or corrupt once in power, or they may deviate from their electoral promises and abuse their powers. However, elections provide voters the opportunity to replace incompetent, dishonest or disappointing leaders. Accountability is fundamental to democracy; it keeps politicians on their toes if they want to be reelected; as a result, they must make an effort to please voters. In an autocracy, accountability is absent. The only way for the populace to oust a dictator is by means of a popular uprising. This is not only more costly in terms of economic disruption and the potential for lives lost, but is also a typical case of a collective-action problem. 3 Communist regimes were the exception as they fully expropriated the assets of the rich and nationalized all wealth. Their motivation was ideological and not based on economic interest.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions development were different in a world where both trade and capital flows were open (as in the early and late 20th century) as compared to a more closed world such as that between the Great Depression and the 1980s. Openness to trade increases competition and thus the need for firms to raise funds to invest and stay competitive. Without financial openness, firms could lobby the government for subsidies and privileged loans, which was the case in many countries after World War II. However, if trade openness is combined with financial openness, that is, free capital mobility, the government’s ability to intervene in favor of certain firms will decrease as it faces the possibility of capital flight out of the country. Capital flight will punish government subsidization of established dinosaur firms and imprudent macroeconomic behavior (running large deficits). Capital mobility thus works as a device to discipline the government. This, in turn, reduces the benefits of lobbying to obtain rents and privileges. Because civil law is more sensitive to decisions in the legislature, Rajan and Zingales argue that the countries with this system were more vulnerable to rent-seeking that prevented financial development in the period between the Great Depression and 1980, when there was less financial and/or trade openness in the world economy. However, in an open world, demand for financial development will be strong and civil-law countries will ultimately pass better legislation for financial development. Thus, the distinction between common-law and civil-law systems may matter more in periods when there is less trade and financial openness than in periods of global trade and increased international capital mobility. Fiscal Institutions Fiscal institutions are the rules and means by which government assures adequate revenue. Fiscal institutions are important because they determine the extent to which the governments of poorer countries can finance public services as well as the extent of tax distortions associated with tax collection. Developing countries desperately need basic public services such as health, education, and infrastructure. These services are crucial not only for social welfare, but also for economic development. On the other hand, poorer countries have fewer means available to support an efficient tax administration apparatus. In less-developed economies, it is also much more difficult to collect information about economic transactions. In many developing economies, transactions are in cash and only a minority of households and firms use banks. Because of these difficulties, developing countries face severe tax collection challenges. Therefore, a much smaller portion of tax revenues come from income taxes on households. Foreign trade taxes are still an important source of revenues. Because of the significant costs of tax collection, governments are often tempted to finance their expenditures by printing money. As a result, inflation is also a serious problem in many developing economies. Taxation in Developing Countries Let us start our examination of fiscal institutions by comparing the importance of government revenues and tax revenues in developing and advanced economies.

We can, for example, argue that presidential countries are generally 


Structural Change and Development Strategies 2. There is considerable risk involved in migrating. Migrants may get a well-paid job in an urban industry, but may also end up unemployed. The probability of becoming unemployed is assumed to increase with the unemployment rate. 3. There will be excess migration if wages in urban areas are higher than rural income. Excess migration will lead to urban unemployment. Figure 5 provides a simplified presentation of the Harris-Todaro model in two steps. Figure 5a looks at the migration decision when there is full employment and full wage flexibility in the urban sector. Figure 5b looks at migration in the presence of labor market rigidities in the urban sector and urban unemployment. To simplify the analysis, we look at a one-period model in which income is given by the wage rate. Migration is assumed to be costless. In Figure 5a, the total labor force (agricultural and urban) is the length of the horizontal axis. At any point on the horizontal line, labor in the traditional agricultural sector L A is measured by the distance between that point and the intersection with the left vertical axis, while the labor force in the modern manufacturing sector L M is measured by the distance between that point and the right vertical axis. Increase in L A is thus represented by a movement from left to right on the horizontal axis, while an increase in L M is represented by a movement from right to left. At the extreme left point, where the horizontal axis intersects with the left vertical axis, all labor would be in manufacturing, with zero labor in the agricultural sector. At the extreme right point, where the horizontal axis intersects with the right vertical axis, all labor would be in agriculture. Curves D A and D M represent labor demand curves in both sectors as a function of wages in the sectors, where the wage levels w A and w M are on the left and right vertical axes, respectively. Demand for labor in each sector FIGURE 5a The Harris-Todaro Model: Migration with Full Urban Employment w A E w M E L M D M D A L A E Agricultural wage rate Manufacturing wage rate D A and D M are the labor demand curves in agriculture and manufacturing, respectively. With full wage flexibility, the migration equilibrium is at point E. At point E, workers are indifferent to leaving or staying in agriculture as the wages in agriculture and manufacturing are equal and there is no urban unemployment.

Political Institutions Chapter Summary Political Regimes The two main types of political regimes are democracy, which spreads political power broadly across society, and autocracy, which concentrates power in the hands of a dictator or a small elite. Economic Effects of an Autocracy versus a Democracy The theory of democracy emphasizes that political competition to gain a majority of votes leads to the enactment of policies preferred by the median voter. The theory of autocracy emphasizes that more stable autocracies tend to be less predatory on their populations in terms of extracting tax revenues. Autocracy, in contrast to democracy, does not redistribute income to the poor and it erects barriers to market entry for new businesses as well as barriers to social mobility. It lacks accountability to its citizens and often promotes policies of territorial expansion. Political Institutions in a Democracy Presidential democracies have smaller governments than do parliamentary democracies because they have more separation of powers. Countries with proportional electoral rules spend more on welfare than countries with majoritarian electoral rules. Political Institutions in an Autocracy Autocracies can differ greatly. Recent history has seen Communist dictatorships, Nazi and Fascist dictatorships, and right-wing dictatorships established during the Cold War. Waves of Democratization The world has experienced three waves of democratization: before and after World War I, after World War II, and toward the end of the Cold War. Democratization in developing countries was more concentrated in the third wave. Many developing countries also experienced a reversal of democracy, while some developing countries have never became democratic. Theories of Democratization Theories of modernization emphasize that as countries become richer and more educated, they tend to become more democratic. While countries with higher income per capita are more democratic, an increase in income and education does not correlate with an improvement in democracy. Another theory of democratization sees it as a commitment device by the elite to redistribute wealth to the poor as a means to prevent a revolution. In countries where income inequality is very high, democratization is very costly for the rich, who prefer to take the risk of repressing political parties that represent the poor. A fifth and related prediction is that the presence of an established middle class is a factor in democratization. The middle class can act as a buffer between the elite and the poor. It will not support policies of excessive redistribution under democracy. Because the middle class plays a pivotal role in elections, redistributive policies will be less extreme under democracy and democratization will appear less threatening to the elite. When there is no middle class or it is very fragile, democracy becomes more threatening to the elite, as the pivotal voters will belong to the poor and not to the middle class. Finally, globalization may positively affect democratization and the stabilization of democracy. It makes capital more mobile and thus more difficult to tax. The elite then have less to fear from taxation under democracy. Moreover, integration in the world economy will increase the costs of economic and social disruption. Periods of revolutionary upheaval or repression will prove to have significant economic costs. Further, repressive policies in nondemocratic countries can lead to international sanctions, such as trade boycotts, from democratic countries.

While countries with higher income per capita are more democratic, an increase in income and education does not correlate with an improvement in democracy. Another theory of democratization sees it as a commitment device by the elite to redistribute wealth to the poor as a means to prevent a revolution. In countries where income inequality is very high, democratization is very costly for the rich, who prefer to take the risk of repressing political parties that represent the poor. A fifth and related prediction is that the presence of an established middle class is a factor in democratization. The middle class can act as a buffer between the elite and the poor. It will not support policies of excessive redistribution under democracy. Because the middle class plays a pivotal role in elections, redistributive policies will be less extreme under democracy and democratization will appear less threatening to the elite. When there is no middle class or it is very fragile, democracy becomes more threatening to the elite, as the pivotal voters will belong to the poor and not to the middle class. Finally, globalization may positively affect democratization and the stabilization of democracy. It makes capital more mobile and thus more difficult to tax. The elite then have less to fear from taxation under democracy. Moreover, integration in the world economy will increase the costs of economic and social disruption. Periods of revolutionary upheaval or repression will prove to have significant economic costs. Further, repressive policies in nondemocratic countries can lead to international sanctions, such as trade boycotts, from democratic countries. 


Political Institutions The Theory of Democracy What are the differences for people living in a democracy as compared to an autocracy? Candidates for office will compete for votes among the population by promising programs that include not only taxes, public services, and redistribution of wealth, but also laws that will protect the populace. The winner is the one who receives more votes than the other candidates and therefore whose programs appear more appealing to a majority of voters. Two aspects of democracy warrant consideration here. First, elected candidates have the support of a majority of voters, which means that government policy will by necessity encompass the interests of at least that majority. Second, competition forces candidates to present the best possible mix of policies to potential voters. Even if policy makers are purely opportunistic and would like to serve their own interests as much as a dictator does, free and competitive elections force them to appeal to a majority of the electorate and create a strong link between majority interests and government policy. The best-known economic theory of democracy is the so-called “median voter theorem.” Imagine that positions on a line, as shown in Figure 4, can represent a population’s policy preferences. Say that the line represents the left- right ideological dimension, with preferences going from left to right, with L and R representing the preferred policies, respectively, of the extreme left and the extreme right. More moderate preferences will thus be in the middle. The median voter M is the voter whose policy preferences are such that 50% of voters are to her left, and 50% of voters are to her right. If a politician can appeal either to all voters to the left (or to the right) of M and also to the median voter, then he will have gained a majority plus one vote, that of the median. To understand the logic of the median voter theorem, let us look at the first line on Figure 4. Here, politician A has a platform that is halfway between the most extreme left position and the median voter’s preferred policy platform. The same holds for politician B who is on the right side of the political spectrum. If these were the platforms presented by these politicians, a clear competition would exist between left-wing candidate A and right-wing candidate B . Each would obtain 50% of the votes because all those to the left of A would vote for A and all those between A and the median voter would also vote for A . Similarly, those to the right of B and those between the median M and B would vote for B . Median voter M would be indifferent between those two platforms and would toss a coin in an election. This cannot be a political FIGURE 4 The Median Voter Theorem L A M B R L A M B R c L A M R B Electoral competition pushes parties A and B to propose policy platforms that are located at the median voter’s preferred position.

Political Institutions revolution for both the elite and the citizens, and it is a credible way of promising redistribution from the elite to the citizens. Democratic institutions guarantee redistribution because of the formal political powers given to the people. Democracy thus solves an important commitment problem. Revolutionary threats. In developing countries, decolonization and democratization were often introduced simultaneously. Much of the developing world in Africa and Asia was still under colonial rule by the end of World War II. Anticolonial movements had developed and were gaining strength. In India, one of the most populated countries in the world, the anticolonial movement had grown quite powerful under the leadership of the Congress Party and its leader, Jawaharlal Nehru. Britain, similar to other European colonial powers, feared that the anticolonial movements would seek the support of the Soviet Union, which had by then become a considerable military and political presence after taking control of Central and Eastern Europe and supporting a Communist revolution in China. The British government, fearing a radicalization of the Indian populace in the face of the Congress Party’s dedication to independence and democracy, granted independence to India in 1947 and it has been a democracy ever since. There is consistent historical evidence that democracy was usually introduced as a response to revolutionary threats. In Great Britain, one of the first countries in which democracy was introduced, it was the fear of a revolutionary movement that prompted the Reform Act of 1832, which extended the franchise from 492,700 to 806,000 voters. In 1830, revolutionary movements had destabilized many European countries and the British aristocracy wanted to make limited concessions to calm social disturbances. However, these concessions were not enough to quell the unrest. The Chartist movement developed to represent working class interests in Victorian England in the nineteenth century and to demand universal suffrage. During a recession in the late 1860s and after alarming riots in London’s Hyde Park in 1866, a second Reform Act was passed in 1867, which further expanded the electorate to 2.48 million. Another Reform Act followed in 1884. By that time, 60% of adult males had the right to vote, and the working class could finally exercise political power. After World War I, all adult men and women over the age of 21 were granted voting rights. It was then that the Labour Party became powerful enough to participate in the government. As in many European countries, the radical extension of suffrage in Britain was seen as a way of avoiding a revolution, such as the one that wracked Russia, in the aftermath of the war’s carnage that had killed millions of young working-class men across Europe. The waning months of World War I were indeed a turning point in many European countries. The revolutionary threat had never been greater. Communists had seized power in Russia in late 1917, while in Germany, revolutionary uprisings were taking place in many large cities such as Munich, where the Marxist Spartacists were becoming increasingly powerful.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions development were different in a world where both trade and capital flows were open (as in the early and late 20th century) as compared to a more closed world such as that between the Great Depression and the 1980s. Openness to trade increases competition and thus the need for firms to raise funds to invest and stay competitive. Without financial openness, firms could lobby the government for subsidies and privileged loans, which was the case in many countries after World War II. However, if trade openness is combined with financial openness, that is, free capital mobility, the government’s ability to intervene in favor of certain firms will decrease as it faces the possibility of capital flight out of the country. Capital flight will punish government subsidization of established dinosaur firms and imprudent macroeconomic behavior (running large deficits). Capital mobility thus works as a device to discipline the government. This, in turn, reduces the benefits of lobbying to obtain rents and privileges. Because civil law is more sensitive to decisions in the legislature, Rajan and Zingales argue that the countries with this system were more vulnerable to rent-seeking that prevented financial development in the period between the Great Depression and 1980, when there was less financial and/or trade openness in the world economy. However, in an open world, demand for financial development will be strong and civil-law countries will ultimately pass better legislation for financial development. Thus, the distinction between common-law and civil-law systems may matter more in periods when there is less trade and financial openness than in periods of global trade and increased international capital mobility. Fiscal Institutions Fiscal institutions are the rules and means by which government assures adequate revenue. Fiscal institutions are important because they determine the extent to which the governments of poorer countries can finance public services as well as the extent of tax distortions associated with tax collection. Developing countries desperately need basic public services such as health, education, and infrastructure. These services are crucial not only for social welfare, but also for economic development. On the other hand, poorer countries have fewer means available to support an efficient tax administration apparatus. In less-developed economies, it is also much more difficult to collect information about economic transactions. In many developing economies, transactions are in cash and only a minority of households and firms use banks. Because of these difficulties, developing countries face severe tax collection challenges. Therefore, a much smaller portion of tax revenues come from income taxes on households. Foreign trade taxes are still an important source of revenues. Because of the significant costs of tax collection, governments are often tempted to finance their expenditures by printing money. As a result, inflation is also a serious problem in many developing economies. Taxation in Developing Countries Let us start our examination of fiscal institutions by comparing the importance of government revenues and tax revenues in developing and advanced economies.

Political Institutions education is a prerequisite for democracy. If people are illiterate, they are not able to follow or participate in political campaigns and will likely have a hard time at the ballot box recognizing the names of candidates. Also, when people are more educated, they are better able to communicate with each other and, as a result they are more able to organize on a larger scale and fight for democracy. Figure 9 shows a positive correlation between education, measured by the total average years of schooling and the Polity IV index. However, just as in the relationship between income and democracy, there is not evidence of a causal relationship between education and democracy. It is possible the causality might run the other way—the introduction of democracy might lead to significant improvements in education. Moreover, a third variable, such as culture, might also contribute to more education and to democracy. The data only tell us that countries with better education are more democratic. Here, again, if we try to determine whether countries that experience an improvement in their educational systems also experience an improvement in democracy, we do not find any positive relationship. Figure 10, taken from another paper by Acemoglu et al., shows the relationship between changes in education in the 1970-1995 period and the change in the Freedom House Political Rights Index over the same period. 11 Just as in the case of changes in income and in democracy, the relationship is flat. 11 Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James A.

Political Institutions A significant example of totalitarianism was China’s Cultural Revolution during the second half of the 1960s. It was a massive social and political campaign that indoctrinated young people, organized into “Red Guard” paramilitary units, to purge the country of all traces of its cultural and historic past. Intellectuals were sent to the countryside to “reform their own view of the world” by laboring in the fields with peasants. Millions of people died from persecution, the country’s cultural inheritance (temples, statues, books, and art), accumulated over thousands of years was destroyed, and the Chinese economy was in shambles for over a decade thereafter. The Cultural Revolution in China The centrally planned socialist economic system introduced in Communist countries ultimately proved to be inferior to capitalism. Communist ideology has virtually vanished from the world as most of the regimes based on it eventually failed and collapsed. Nazism and Fascism As a political and economic system, Nazism was more short-lived than Communism. In Germany, the Nazi regime began in 1933 under Adolph Hitler’s leadership, and was predicated on power centralized in a totalitarian dictatorship, the superiority of the Germanic races, and the supremacy of the Führer , the leader. It lasted until 1945, when the combined Soviet and Western Allied forces defeated the Nazis at the end of World War II. In Italy, Benito Mussolini set up a similar regime in 1922 that was called Fascist and exalted similar values: nationalism, corporatism, the cult of violence and of the supreme leader, the Duce. It lasted until the Allied forces began the liberation of Italy in 1943. Similar right-wing dictatorships were established in Spain by General Francisco Franco at the end of the Spanish Civil War (1939) and in Portugal after a military coup in 1926 that was followed by António de Oliveira Salazar’s dictatorship (1932-1968). Many leaders in developing countries were inspired by these regimes, as was the case for Juan Peron, president of Argentina between 1946 and 1955. Despite the brutality of their dictatorships, the Fascist governments of Italy, Spain, and Portugal were not as barbaric and totalitarian as Hitler’s Nazi regime, which systematically exterminated 6 million Jews and at least 5 million others (gypsies, the disabled, psychiatric patients, homosexuals, political opponents, and other racial minorities and non-Germanic peoples). Nazism was based on a nationalist ideology that claimed Germans were members of a superior Aryan race and that all other races were inferior, often deemed not worthy of continued existence. It venerated a cult of violence and physical strength. Economically, Nazism as well as the various forms of Fascism did not favor central planning or government ownership but advocated what was at the time called corporatism , that is, an economic system in which access to markets and competition are severely restricted so as to favor established industries and the financial status quo. Nazism and Fascism virtually disappeared after World War II and are currently supported only by small fringe groups across the world. 


Political Institutions and which make the difference between having a majority versus a minority of seats. In the extreme, the party might put all its effort into winning the one district that could deliver a majority of seats. Trying to please voters in districts that will deliver safe seats would not make sense, as this would deliver more votes but not more seats. Similarly, it does not make political sense to spend resources in districts sure to be won by other parties. Political incentives are different in the case of proportional elections. As the share of seats is proportional to the share of votes, a party will try to please as many voters as possible. It makes no sense to concentrate only on certain categories of voters, as it is possible to gain more seats by appealing to a broader share of the electorate. The incentives of politicians are thus different under the two different electoral rules. What does this difference in incentives mean in terms of fiscal policy? Under majoritarian elections, politicians will pay more attention to local public services that benefit only the voters in the districts that are relevant to winning an election. Under proportional elections, they will pay more attention to services that benefit the largest possible number of voters. As a result, social welfare spending will be greater in the latter category. Politicians in majoritarian systems have fewer incentives to spend on social welfare programs that are not targeted to a specific electoral district. Spending one more dollar per person is more costly for social welfare or pensions because more people will benefit from it in the majoritarian system. The results are greater and less costly when spending higher sums on the swing voters in the marginal districts. This may explain why countries with proportional elections spend more on social welfare than countries with majoritarian elections. Political Institutions in an Autocracy Turning to nondemocratic regimes, or autocracies, which currently exist only in developing countries, their various types are distinguished by the interests they represent, the ideology they defend, and among other characteristics, their rules for the succession of leadership. Communist Regimes In 1917, a Communist regime came to power in Russia; after World War II, similar regimes appeared in Eastern Europe, China, and parts of Asia (Mongolia, North Vietnam, and North Korea). Cuba established a Communist regime shortly after Fidel Castro’s revolutionaries overthrew the right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Communist regimes are characterized by the oneparty rule, suppression of democratic freedoms, and an economic system with central planning and government ownership of economic assets. These systems were founded on Communist ideology, which claimed that central planning and redirecting a society’s focus on individualism toward collectivism would lead to larger economic prosperity than would capitalism. Political repression was considered necessary to fight attempts by capitalist regimes to destroy Communism. With their intense ideology, Communist regimes became totalitarian in the sense that they sought to influence and control all aspects of citizens’ lives. Children were encouraged to denounce their parents if they heard any “counterrevolutionary” thoughts expressed at home. 


Poverty and Inequality equal income distribution have access to more credit, they are better able to expand their economic activities than those in the more unequal economy. Political economy. Another explanation for income inequality negatively impacting economic growth is based on political economy, the interaction between economics and politics. The basic political economy argument emphasizes the negative consequences of greater pressures for income redistribution, especially in democratic countries where a majority of poor people can vote to tax the rich. Pressures for redistribution can also take place through strikes, protest movements, trade union actions, etc. If a high initial level of income inequality leads to a high level of income redistribution, there will thus be more economic distortions associated with such redistribution. For example, if redistribution is financed from income taxes, a high tax on labor income will decrease labor supply because labor supply in the economy generally increases with income. Similarly, a high tax on capital income may lead to decreased investment or capital flight. These distortions will then have a negative effect on growth. More income inequality may simply lead to resentment that results in social unrest and instability in the form of protests and riots, especially if bad economic shocks hit the poor. This could also have a negative effect on economic growth. Note that there can be countervailing forces to the political economy argument. Instead of voting to redistribute money from the rich to the poor, people may vote for more public services such as education, health, or infrastructure improvements that benefit the poor but may also encourage economic growth. More money for education may increase the general level of human capital, making people more productive and thus leading to more growth in the economy. However, if this argument is valid, then more public services should eventually lead to less income inequality. Higher economic growth related to initial inequality would then eventually lead to less inequality. This reasoning leads us to an important point: in theories that predict a negative effect of income inequality on economic growth, the causality runs from inequality to growth. However, we can also argue that there is, instead, a causal chain from growth to inequality, in line with the Kuznets hypothesis. It is even more plausible that the causality runs in both directions. Finding a causal link between inequality and growth empirically is very challenging. That research question is still wide open. Inequality over Time Has income inequality increased or decreased worldwide over time? It has increased in many regions of the world in the past few decades. As a consequence of the transition from socialism to capitalism, countries from Central and Eastern Europe to China have had a large increase in inequality and it has increased significantly in the United States since the 1980s. It has also increased in many West European countries and countries on other continents. Instead of looking at income inequality within specific countries, an alternative approach is to determine whether it has increased or decreased worldwide. This requires examining the world distribution of income as if the world were one country. Take the examples of the United States and China. Income inequality has increased in both countries. However, living standards have 


Corruption Subjective Measures of Corruption Subjective measures of corruption do not suffer from some of the main problems encountered with objective measures. Subjective measures are more comprehensive and are constructed so as to make international comparisons possible. Their disadvantage is that they are based on perceptions of corruption and this can be problematic if those perceptions are biased by different kinds of prejudice. A country with a past history of corruption might be perceived to be more corrupt than it really is. Citizens who are distrustful of their government might underestimate the effects of a campaign against corruption. Very often, the indices of corruption are developed from diverse independent sources in order to try to minimize these kinds of prejudices, but there is no guarantee that the results will be free from bias. One of the first surveys on corruption was produced by the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG; http://www.prsgroup.com/countrydata.aspx). This publication is produced by a private company that attempts to measure country risk for firms that are considering investments in a particular country. The corruption index measures a) the likelihood that high government officials will demand special payments; and b) the extent of illegal payments expected by the various tiers of the country’s government. However, the composite indicator produced by the ICRG also mixes corruption with the political risk produced by corruption. The data that result are usually sold to private firms and then published online several years later. A very well-known survey of corruption is the Corruption Perceptions Index, published each year since 1995 by Transparency International. Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index measures the perceived level of public sector corruption in countries and territories around the world. In a given year, this organization collects 18 different polls from 12 different institutions for different countries. The criteria for including a poll or indicator in the Corruption Perceptions Index are: a) to be consistent across all countries and thus to enable a ranking across countries; and b) to cover the overall extent of corruption and not combine it with other issues. Questions included are related to the level of kickbacks in public procurement, the bribing of bureaucrats, and the level of public-funds embezzlement. An interesting feature of the index is that respondents to the different surveys included are from various backgrounds: residents of the country, whether nationals or expatriates from multinational firms, and nonresidents such as international experts and international businessmen. Note that there is, in general, a high correlation between the different surveys used. Figure 1 displays the Corruption Perceptions Index for 2011. The darker colors denote higher levels of corruption. The least-corrupt countries are New Zealand, the Scandinavian countries, Singapore, Netherlands, Australia, and Canada. This chapter’s appendix reveals that the United States ranks 24th. Note that Chile has a better score than the United States. Among the most corrupt countries are Somalia, North Korea, Myanmar (Burma), Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Sudan. Russia and many of the former Soviet republics also have very high scores for corruption along with many African countries. The chapter appendix gives a ranking of all countries for 2011 together with country scores, as well as the number of surveys used for each country’s score and a country’s standard deviation.

Note that there is, in general, a high correlation between the different surveys used. Figure 1 displays the Corruption Perceptions Index for 2011. The darker colors denote higher levels of corruption. The least-corrupt countries are New Zealand, the Scandinavian countries, Singapore, Netherlands, Australia, and Canada. This chapter’s appendix reveals that the United States ranks 24th. Note that Chile has a better score than the United States. Among the most corrupt countries are Somalia, North Korea, Myanmar (Burma), Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Sudan. Russia and many of the former Soviet republics also have very high scores for corruption along with many African countries. The chapter appendix gives a ranking of all countries for 2011 together with country scores, as well as the number of surveys used for each country’s score and a country’s standard deviation. 


Political Institutions A significant example of totalitarianism was China’s Cultural Revolution during the second half of the 1960s. It was a massive social and political campaign that indoctrinated young people, organized into “Red Guard” paramilitary units, to purge the country of all traces of its cultural and historic past. Intellectuals were sent to the countryside to “reform their own view of the world” by laboring in the fields with peasants. Millions of people died from persecution, the country’s cultural inheritance (temples, statues, books, and art), accumulated over thousands of years was destroyed, and the Chinese economy was in shambles for over a decade thereafter. The Cultural Revolution in China The centrally planned socialist economic system introduced in Communist countries ultimately proved to be inferior to capitalism. Communist ideology has virtually vanished from the world as most of the regimes based on it eventually failed and collapsed. Nazism and Fascism As a political and economic system, Nazism was more short-lived than Communism. In Germany, the Nazi regime began in 1933 under Adolph Hitler’s leadership, and was predicated on power centralized in a totalitarian dictatorship, the superiority of the Germanic races, and the supremacy of the Führer , the leader. It lasted until 1945, when the combined Soviet and Western Allied forces defeated the Nazis at the end of World War II. In Italy, Benito Mussolini set up a similar regime in 1922 that was called Fascist and exalted similar values: nationalism, corporatism, the cult of violence and of the supreme leader, the Duce. It lasted until the Allied forces began the liberation of Italy in 1943. Similar right-wing dictatorships were established in Spain by General Francisco Franco at the end of the Spanish Civil War (1939) and in Portugal after a military coup in 1926 that was followed by António de Oliveira Salazar’s dictatorship (1932-1968). Many leaders in developing countries were inspired by these regimes, as was the case for Juan Peron, president of Argentina between 1946 and 1955. Despite the brutality of their dictatorships, the Fascist governments of Italy, Spain, and Portugal were not as barbaric and totalitarian as Hitler’s Nazi regime, which systematically exterminated 6 million Jews and at least 5 million others (gypsies, the disabled, psychiatric patients, homosexuals, political opponents, and other racial minorities and non-Germanic peoples). Nazism was based on a nationalist ideology that claimed Germans were members of a superior Aryan race and that all other races were inferior, often deemed not worthy of continued existence. It venerated a cult of violence and physical strength. Economically, Nazism as well as the various forms of Fascism did not favor central planning or government ownership but advocated what was at the time called corporatism , that is, an economic system in which access to markets and competition are severely restricted so as to favor established industries and the financial status quo. Nazism and Fascism virtually disappeared after World War II and are currently supported only by small fringe groups across the world. 


Corruption countries with electoral rules that make politicians more accountable. In terms of those rules, one important distinction is between those that are closed list and those that are open list. With closed-list electoral rules, a candidate’s place on the electoral list determines the probability of whether he or she is reelected, whereas with an open-list system, the probability of a candidate’s reelection depends only on the number of votes he or she receives. Thus, under closed-list electoral rules, it is possible for a politician to be reelected without getting many votes. In other words, voters cannot vote out a corrupt politician who is placed high on the list. This effect is potentially more present under proportional electoral rule, where more than one representative is elected per district. Closed lists should thus favor more corruption, in contrast to open lists. In systems with open-list electoral rules, what are the effects of proportional electoral rule and plurality rule? Two effects are possible. On one hand, it is difficult for new parties to participate in elections under plurality rule because the seat in a district goes to the party with the most votes. It is thus quite a challenge for a new party to win seats because it must garner the most votes in a district to do so. With entry being more difficult and costly, there generally are only two parties competing nationally and it is very rare for a third party to emerge as a significant player. The electorate will vote strategically for one of the two most important parties and will rarely waste their votes on a third party. This should favor corruption because it is possible for corrupt parties to continue to compete with each other without being threatened by a new party. It would take exceptional circumstances and strong coordination among voters for them to shift their votes to a new, uncorrupt party. 16 There is, however, an opposite effect: Competition is stiffer under plurality rule because it is a “winner-take-all” electoral system. This could reduce incentives for corruption, which could be more severely punished electorally. What does the evidence suggest? Torsten Persson, Guido Tabellini, and Francesco Trebbi found international evidence for these three effects (closed list versus open list, higher costs of entry versus stiffer competition) under plurality rule compared to proportional rule. 17 Overall, the difference between the effects of proportional and plurality rule on corruption is, however, not very large. The study cited above by Kunicova and Rose-Ackerman also found that closed-list proportional rule had poorer results in terms of corruption than did majoritarian electoral rule. However, according to Treisman’s 2007 study cited above, these electoral rule effects were not extremely robust. In terms of corruption, another distinction between political institutions is found in the comparison of centralized political systems and federal systems, where political and fiscal authority is decentralized to lower levels of government. One argument suggested by Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny is that under centralization, bribes are also centralized, while under decentralization, a “tragedy of the commons” effect can occur when different levels of government 16 See, for example, Roger B. Myerson, “Effectiveness of Electoral Systems for Reducing Government Corruption: A Game-Theoretic Analysis,” Games and Economic Behavior 5, no. 1 (1993): 118-132. 17 Torsten Persson, Guido Tabellini, and Francesco Trebbi, “Electoral Rules and Corruption,” Journal of the European Economic Association 1, no. 4 (2003): 958-989. 


Poverty and Inequality equal income distribution have access to more credit, they are better able to expand their economic activities than those in the more unequal economy. Political economy. Another explanation for income inequality negatively impacting economic growth is based on political economy, the interaction between economics and politics. The basic political economy argument emphasizes the negative consequences of greater pressures for income redistribution, especially in democratic countries where a majority of poor people can vote to tax the rich. Pressures for redistribution can also take place through strikes, protest movements, trade union actions, etc. If a high initial level of income inequality leads to a high level of income redistribution, there will thus be more economic distortions associated with such redistribution. For example, if redistribution is financed from income taxes, a high tax on labor income will decrease labor supply because labor supply in the economy generally increases with income. Similarly, a high tax on capital income may lead to decreased investment or capital flight. These distortions will then have a negative effect on growth. More income inequality may simply lead to resentment that results in social unrest and instability in the form of protests and riots, especially if bad economic shocks hit the poor. This could also have a negative effect on economic growth. Note that there can be countervailing forces to the political economy argument. Instead of voting to redistribute money from the rich to the poor, people may vote for more public services such as education, health, or infrastructure improvements that benefit the poor but may also encourage economic growth. More money for education may increase the general level of human capital, making people more productive and thus leading to more growth in the economy. However, if this argument is valid, then more public services should eventually lead to less income inequality. Higher economic growth related to initial inequality would then eventually lead to less inequality. This reasoning leads us to an important point: in theories that predict a negative effect of income inequality on economic growth, the causality runs from inequality to growth. However, we can also argue that there is, instead, a causal chain from growth to inequality, in line with the Kuznets hypothesis. It is even more plausible that the causality runs in both directions. Finding a causal link between inequality and growth empirically is very challenging. That research question is still wide open. Inequality over Time Has income inequality increased or decreased worldwide over time? It has increased in many regions of the world in the past few decades. As a consequence of the transition from socialism to capitalism, countries from Central and Eastern Europe to China have had a large increase in inequality and it has increased significantly in the United States since the 1980s. It has also increased in many West European countries and countries on other continents. Instead of looking at income inequality within specific countries, an alternative approach is to determine whether it has increased or decreased worldwide. This requires examining the world distribution of income as if the world were one country. Take the examples of the United States and China. Income inequality has increased in both countries. However, living standards have

Corruption try to extract bribes from the same businesses. 18 Empirically, no significant link has been found between federalism or fiscal decentralization and the degree of corruption, and this is not really surprising because the argument is not about decentralization per se. The reasoning on centralization and decentralization only holds if there is some confusion of powers between the different levels of government. If those levels do not have overlapping jurisdiction, then the Shleifer and Vishny argument will not hold. Legal Institutions and Corruption The quality of a country’s legal system may also affect corruption. The differences between civil-law and common-law systems were discussed; the measures of legal formalism and bureaucratic regulation were presented. The 2000 Treisman study found that measures of legal formalism (such as the time it takes to evict a tenant who does not pay his rent or to indict somebody who passes a bad check) are correlated with corruption. Treisman also found that the number of days it takes to register a new business has a significant positive correlation with corruption. However, it is not clear in which direction the causality is going. High levels of legal formalism might lead to more corruption because more red tape invites more opportunities for extracting bribes. On the other hand, corruption might lead to a deterioration of the legal system and to a slowing of the judicial and administrative systems. When testing for the causality between formalism and corruption by using the legal origin (civil law or common law) as an instrumental variable for formalism, there appears to be no significant effect at all between formalism and corruption. Natural Resources, Trade, and Corruption Some have suggested that countries with more natural resources have more corruption. The idea is that if a country has large oil reserves or other valuable natural resources such as gold, its government officials and bureaucrats will have more opportunities to enrich themselves by grabbing rents from those resources, as was the case with Mobutu in Zaire. On the other hand, countries that are more open to trade and face competitive economic conditions in the global marketplace, including competition from imports, are less likely to be prone to corruption because there will be less rents to grab. Alberto Ades and Rafael Di Tella found international evidence to support these ideas. They identified a positive association between corruption and the share of fuels and minerals in total exports, and a negative association between corruption and the share of imports in GDP as a measure of openness to trade. 19 Treisman found that the effect of openness took time to kick in. 20 Countries that liberalized earlier in time therefore had lower corruption scores. 18 Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny, “Corruption,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 108, no. 3 (1993): 599-617. 19 Alberto Ades and Rafael Di Tella, “Rents, Competition, and Corruption,” The American Economic Review 89, no. 4 (1999): 982-993. 20 Treisman, “What Have We Learned about the Causes of Corruption from Ten Years of Cross-National Empirical Research?” 2007.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions No one likes to receive a check that later bounces. How long it takes, however, to collect on a bounced check varies significantly across countries. If you have to file a claim and then go to court to collect the money, the length of the process is roughly 54 days in the United States. In Sri Lanka, it is 440 days. Sri Lanka is a poor country and it is not surprising that its legal system is not as efficient as that of the United States. However, the quality of a country’s legal institutions also matters in terms of how those institutions affect transaction costs in the economy and thus the process of development. In Ghana, also a poor country, the whole process would last only 90 days, nearly 5 times faster than in Sri Lanka. In this chapter, we will examine the role of legal institutions in economic development. T he quality of the fiscal system in a developing country is also a critical consideration. Basic public services such as health, education, and infrastructure require a stable tax base. These services are important both for social welfare and economic growth in developing countries. Raising taxes in a developing country to pay for these services is, however, a challenge, given the large size of the informal sector that pays no taxes. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, until recently, even government officials’ income taxes were not paid at the source. How do poor countries collect taxes and what problems do they face in doing so? Why do some developing countries collect taxes more effectively than others? This chapter will also consider fiscal institutions in developing countries. Legal Institutions Quite broadly, the legal institutions of a country are the set of laws and the controlling authorities (the police and the justice system) that enforce those laws. In democratic societies, laws stipulate the rights of individuals and corporations and prohibit or control actions and behaviors that could infringe on those rights. In nondemocratic societies, laws may have other purposes such as enforcing religious prescriptions or the edicts of a monarch. Laws exist in all spheres of society. In the economic sphere, commercial law is generally comprised of rules related to trade and exchange transactions. Financial and securities laws relate to financial markets, and labor laws relate to labor markets. Administrative law, procurement law, and constitutional law control the actions of government. In recent years, an important body of research has compared the economic effects of different legal systems. The two most important legal systems in the world are the common-law legal system, which prevails in countries of Anglo-Saxon descent (the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia) and former British colonies, and the civil-law system, which

Legal and Fiscal Institutions countries offer better protection of creditor rights than do civil-law countries. Interestingly, the developing countries generally score better than the developed countries within each legal category. Quality of law enforcement. Tables 2 and 3 compare measures of existing shareholder and creditor rights. However, the quality of law enforcement is even more important for protecting those rights. Table 4 presents a series of variables that attempt to measure law-enforcement quality. The indicator of efficiency of the judicial system is a score from 0 to 10 taken from Business International Corporation, which rates the risks associated with investing in a particular country. It represents investors’ assessments of the “efficiency and integrity of the legal environment as it affects business, particularly foreign firms.” It has a higher value for common-law than for civil-law countries, but the biggest difference occurs between developed and developing countries: scores for the former are clearly higher than for the latter. A similar pattern holds for the indicator of the rule of law, which is from another rating agency, the International Country Risk Guide. Here, no difference exists between common-law and civil-law countries. The only difference occurs between developed and developing countries, illustrating once again the importance of institutions to development. We can draw a similar conclusion from the next three indicators, corruption, risk of appropriation, and risk of contract repudiation, also taken from the International Country Risk Guide: common-law and civil-law countries do not differ substantially in terms of law-enforcement quality. The main difference is again between developed and developing countries. We can thus conclude that while the differences in the legal protections for shareholders and creditors between common-law and civil-law systems are relevant, the common-law and civil-law distinction in developing countries is of second-order importance relative to the issue of the quality of law enforcement, which fundamentally affects the security of property rights.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions findings: 1) there was a very large variation in the development of world financial markets throughout the 20th century; and 2) financial markets were more developed in 1913 than in 1980 and have only recently surpassed the 1913 level. Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of three measures of financial development. The first two variables in Figure 1 are similar to those listed in Table 5: stock market capitalization as a share of GDP and the number of listed domestic companies per million inhabitants. The third variable measures equity issues by domestic corporations as a share of gross fixed capital formation, that is, gross investment. It gives us an idea of what percentage of the economy’s investment is financed by issuing shares. Even though the three measures vary over time, common patterns nevertheless exist. First, from 1913 until the stock market crash of 1929, stock market development was stronger than in much of the rest of the 20th century, at least until the 1990s. Second, stock market development declined from the period of the Great Depression (the 1930s) until at least the late 1980s. Third, there was rapid financial market development in the 1990s, the period we now identify with globalization. These data remind us that globalization had already begun in the early 20th century. If financial market development has varied so much over time, what are we to make of the distinction between common-law and civil-law countries in terms of this measure? Figure 2 shows the evolution of stock market capitalization as a share of GDP over time for these categories of countries. Note that the sample of developing countries is much smaller here. Only India and South Africa are in the sample for common-law developing countries, while Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Egypt represent the sample for civil-law developing countries.

First, from 1913 until the stock market crash of 1929, stock market development was stronger than in much of the rest of the 20th century, at least until the 1990s. Second, stock market development declined from the period of the Great Depression (the 1930s) until at least the late 1980s. Third, there was rapid financial market development in the 1990s, the period we now identify with globalization. These data remind us that globalization had already begun in the early 20th century. If financial market development has varied so much over time, what are we to make of the distinction between common-law and civil-law countries in terms of this measure? Figure 2 shows the evolution of stock market capitalization as a share of GDP over time for these categories of countries. Note that the sample of developing countries is much smaller here. Only India and South Africa are in the sample for common-law developing countries, while Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Egypt represent the sample for civil-law developing countries.

Institutions and Economic Development cooked quickly when exposed to microwaves. Thus, there can be a significant difference between the original purpose of an invention and its ultimate practical function, which in the case of the microwave, was quite accidental. This is also the case for many inventions such as silicon, saccharin, and the cardiac pacemaker among many others. A similar process has occurred for many institutions. Settlers who came to North America or Australia did not have in mind the goal of creating institutions for successful economic development. They were primarily focused on preventing the creation of a monarchy such as the one they had left in England. Freedom from tyranny was their objective. They had no idea that the institutions they created would lead to phenomenal economic success. This discussion illustrates the idea that function does not constitute an explanation for existence. There is the danger of the functionalist fallacy , which mistakes an object’s function for the cause of its existence. Why is this distinction important? If we did not pay attention to this problem, we would tend to adhere to the view that institutions are always efficient. Indeed, if institutions solve certain problems, we would tend to believe that once a problem emerges, an institution will automatically appear to solve it. If this were the case, institutions would always be efficient. In fact, many institutions are typically inefficient, and inefficient institutions can persist for a very long time. Bringing about change to institutions requires overcoming the collective-action problem. This is very difficult to do in developing countries, especially if democratic institutions are absent or imperfect. Corruption is rife in many developing economies, with inefficient courts, dictatorial regimes, little protection for property rights, and a lack of formal titling systems. Inefficient formal institutions are very hard to overcome, especially when they aim to prevent agents from organizing to change them. Until considerable individual courage and group mobilization can overcome inefficient institutions, they may persist for a very long time. The expansion of institutionalism that has taken place in economic theory is a revival of sorts. Economists developed contract theory and principal agent theory to analyze problems with individual transactions between agents who are in a contractual relationship. Game theory provides the tools to consider such problems analytically. Nevertheless, before game theory was developed, many economists already took institutions very seriously even though they were not part of mainstream theory. Throughout the 20th century, quite a few famous economists tried to understand the role of institutions and how they develop. We mention some of these prominent economists below. Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929), in a famous book called The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), coined the concept of conspicuous consumption , explaining that consumption among the rich was dictated more by a desire to show one’s wealth and status rather than by the useful characteristics of the good consumed.

Source : Rajan and Zingales, “The Great Reversals: The Politics of Financial Development in the Twentieth Century,” 2003: 14. Figure 2 demonstrates that the dynamics throughout the 20th century were similar for both civil-law and common-law countries. First, stock market capitalization relative to GDP was higher in 1913 compared to 1980, both for civil-law and common-law developed countries. Second, all categories have had rapid stock market development since 1980. The slope for civil-law and common-law developed countries is virtually the same; if anything, the development has been weaker for the developing countries (but remember that our sample is very small). We do, however, see that stock market capitalization was quite depressed in civil-law countries from World War II until 1980, whereas common-law countries developed strongly after World War II, despite a decline in the 1970s. What should we conclude from all this? If financial markets were well developed in the early 20th century and have been developing very strongly since the end of the century in both common-law and civil-law countries, does that mean that the distinction between the two legal systems is not very relevant? Perhaps, but on the other hand, in the middle of the 20th century, financial markets were more depressed in civil-law countries compared to common law-countries, especially in the 40 years since World War II. Rajan and Zingales suggest why we may see this pattern. The evolution of civil law is more dependent on the actions of the legislature, that is, the laws politicians enact. Firms lobby to obtain or maintain favorable monopoly positions, rents, and legal arrangements. This is called rent-seeking .

Political Institutions Definitions Autocracy A government in which all power resides in a single person such as a dictator, monarch, or supreme religious leader. Civil society development Situation in which citizens are more organized in various associations, political parties, unions, etc. In other words, citizens increase their ability to overcome collective-action problems. Corporatism An economic system in which access to markets and competition are severely restricted so as to favor established industries and the financial status quo. There are, however, other meanings of corporatism in other contexts. Democracy Political regimes where political leaders are selected through free, fair, and competitive elections in which all adult citizens have the right to vote and all political parties have the right to participate in elections and governance. Democracy is founded on the premise that all citizens enjoy fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom of movement. District magnitude The average number of seats for elected representatives in a district. Divided government Situation in which the ex-ecutive and the legislative branches of government are each controlled by another party or coalition. Fascist Describes the dictatorial regime established in Italy by Benito Mussolini in 1922 that exalted similar values to Nazism: nationalism, corporatism, the cult of violence, and of the supreme leader, Il Duce . Majoritarian rule Electoral rule also called “first past the post,” “plurality rule,” or “single-member district.” With majoritarian rule, only one representative—the candidate with the most votes—is elected per legislative district. All that a candidate needs is to have more votes than the other candidates. Nazism German totalitarian regime that began in 1933 under Adolph Hitler’s leadership and was based on an ideology asserting the superiority of the Germanic races and the supremacy of the Führer , the leader. It lasted until 1945, when the combined Soviet and Western Allied forces defeated the Nazis at the end of World War II. Parliamentary regime Usually, a form of political democracy in which the executive branch is appointed by a parliamentary majority. In a parliamentary regime, the legislative branch can routinely vote down an executive for political reasons through a vote of no confidence. Presidential regime Usually, a form of political democracy in which the president, who heads the executive branch, is directly elected by voters. Proportional rule Electoral rule in which the share of seats for the different parties is allocated proportionally to the share of votes parties receive.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions Let us discuss the indicators in Table 2. For each of the variables of shareholder protection listed, the number in the table gives us the proportion of countries in a particular category that features the particular shareholder protection. For example, only 11% of common-law developed countries have the one share-one vote rule, which implies that nonvoting shares are prohibited or that there is no limit on the number of votes per shareholder. This rule can be broken in many ways; for example, shares of the company founders can carry more votes, shares held for a longer time period may carry more votes, and some shares may carry no votes at all. Very few countries have the one share-one vote provision. Interestingly, it tends to be more prevalent in developing countries and it is highest in the civil-law developing countries. A second variable, proxy by mail, protects small shareholders who may not be able to attend meetings. Here, common-law countries do better. The third variable, shares not blocked before meeting, prohibits firms from requiring that shareholders deposit their shares prior to a shareholders meeting, so as to prevent them from selling the shares. These requirements discourage small shareholders from attending a meeting by making it more costly to do so. All common-law countries have this provision, but it is less prevalent in civil-law countries. The fourth variable relates to the protection of minority shareholders. Cumulative voting means that a shareholder can cast all of his or her votes for one candidate for the board of directors; proportional representation means that the law allows minority interests to be proportionally represented on the board. The fifth variable, the oppressed minority, refers to a) whether company law gives minority shareholders a judicial venue to challenge management decisions or decisions of the shareholders assembly, and b) whether minority shareholders can force the company to buy their shares if they object to fundamental changes such as mergers. Common-law countries do better here. All developed common-law countries have an oppressed minority mechanism as do 89% of the developing common-law countries. Less than 50% of civil-law countries have this mechanism. The sixth variable, preemptive rights to new issues, refers to the shareholder right to buy new issues of company stock. This protects shareholders from dilution of their shares, a tactic that management often uses to weaken certain groups of shareholders. No major differences between groups of countries exist for this variable, except that developed civil-law countries score higher. Finally, a lower percentage of shares to call an extraordinary shareholders meeting favors small shareholders as it makes it easier for them to organize. It is somewhat lower in common-law countries and is higher in developing civil-law countries. The shareholder rights index is the summation of the seven variables listed. Minority shareholder rights are, in general, better protected in common-law countries compared to civil-law countries. Developed common-law countries do better than developing common-law countries. For civil-law countries, it is the opposite. Protection of creditor rights. We now look at the protection of creditor rights in the same groups of countries. These are the rights that creditors have when debtors default on their payments. Table 3 shows the key variables. As in

Institutions and Economic Development Review Questions 1. Give an example (different from those discussed in the chapter) of an economic transaction that is more difficult to complete in developing countries than it would be in developed countries. 2. Many solutions to informational problems emerge spontaneously as contractual innovations. Is there a role for the formal institution of law with respect to these contractual innovations, and if so, why? 3. Reputation is important for contract enforcement when formal institutions are weak. Explain. What conditions in the economic environment make reputation work more or less efficiently? Why? 4. Give examples of formal and informal institutions as solutions for the cooperation problem that we have not discussed in the chapter. Explain your choices. 5. Why is the coordination problem important in the context of development? 6. Write down the problem of cooperation for two countries, A and B, in the fight against climate change and use a payoff matrix as in the case of the prisoner’s dilemma. Payoffs are y A ( x A , x B ) and y B ( x A , x B ), where x A and x B can take two values: 1) if measures are taken in the country against climate change and 2) if no measures are taken. What are the conditions of the payoffs in each cell for each player so that there is a unique Nash equilibrium in which no country takes any action against climate change? 7. Assume a coordination problem related to honest business practices, based on the following payoff matrix: What are the conditions on the payoff matrix so that both A and B being honest and dishonest are both equilibria? How would you have to change the payoffs so that both A and B being dishonest is the only equilibrium? What change would that represent in the problem analyzed? 8. Assume that an Indian firm is contacted by a multinational car company to produce brake systems. This requires an initial investment of I from the Indian subcontractor and a variable cost c per braking system. The car company plans to buy n brake systems from the subcontractor. What is the price p at which the Indian subcontractor would break even? At what price p’ can the car company still convince the subcontractor to produce the systems once it has made the investment? 9. Look up the following article by Simon Brinsmead: “Oil Concession Contracts and the Problem of Hold-Up,” downloadable at http://www.dundee.ac.uk/cepmlp/journal/ html/Vol17/Vol17_11.pdf. How do the ideas in this article relate to this chapter’s discussion? Assume you were advising the government of a developing country with oil reserves. What kind of contract would you recommend to the government? Explain. 10.

From an early age, Chinese children are taught to save money. In Chinese cities, even children from poor families have savings accounts. Even though their family income is much smaller than that of an average American family, many Chinese children have more money in their savings accounts than do most American children. To encourage children not to spend their savings, parents sometimes promise to increase their children’s pocket money by 50%. The culture of thrift taught to children from an early age plays a potentially important role in explaining why China has one of the highest savings rates in the world. This is just one example of the importance of culture to economic development. Culture, understood as a people’s values and beliefs about the world and the social norms derived from those beliefs, has traditionally been absent from economic theory. Economists have been reluctant to embrace cultural explanations as a means to understand questions about development and economics in general. They believed that culture was a topic best left to anthropologists or sociologists. One reason economists have shied away from including the consideration of culture in economic theory is that culture is not easy to define and even more difficult to measure. We can measure wealth and most of the variables used in economic theories, but how do we measure culture? Nevertheless, it is difficult to defend the claim that economists, especially those interested in economic development, should not be interested in culture’s economic effects. In addition to influencing attitudes about thrift, cultural values also affect people’s attitudes about work and effort, the role of women in society, and social and religious tolerance, among others. These values arguably have economic effects that are possibly quite significant to development. Culture plays a fundamental role in other social science theories. Max Weber (1864-1920), the famous German sociologist, considered culture to be a primary force of economic change. In his famous book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, he argues that the Protestant ethic of Calvinism was a powerful force behind the early development of capitalism. Calvinism emphasized the virtues of hard work, asceticism, and frugal life. According to Calvinism’s doctrine of predestination, God selected only certain people for salvation; everyone else faced damnation. Calvinists believed that their hard work and accumulation of wealth proved they were among God’s chosen. Unlike the Catholic Church, Calvinism did not condemn usury, the lending of money with exorbitant interest rates, and it was critical of charity, which it believed encouraged the poor to be lazy and depraved, behaviors that proved they had not been chosen for salvation. Weber argued that Protestantism’s stronger emphasis on thrift and hard work compared to Catholicism’s path to salvation through sacraments and obedience to clerical authority were fundamental reasons why Protestant countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands industrialized earlier than Catholic countries such as France or Spain.

Culture be more willing to save, which could lead to higher growth via larger investment. The fear of hell might also positively impact individuals in terms of making them more virtuous. These channels are, however, not directly tested. In other words, regressions of beliefs in heaven and hell on savings or some measure of virtue are not performed. Greater church attendance might reflect a religion’s stronger influence on social and political life, which might negatively affect growth. Again, the channel has not been investigated. These are just preliminary results on religion’s effect on growth, and they only look at a few aspects of religion, but this topic is likely to become important in the future. It is indeed not clear that the secularization hypothesis is valid in the long run; different societies, even very affluent ones, experience periods of religious revival as well as periods of increased secularization. Religious Beliefs and Trust Trust is important for development in many ways. When people trust each other, business transactions are made easier. Law enforcement is less costly as most people are trustworthy. This means the controls to ensure that citizens abide by the law will be less costly. Politicians and bureaucrats will also be more accountable as high standards of honesty will be expected of them. Deviations from these standards are likely to be punished harshly. Moreover, because generalized trust is usually associated with a civic culture, people will participate more in collective activities and will tend to free-ride less. Is there a relationship between people’s religious beliefs and their willingness to trust others? This is a question that Luigi Guiso, Paolo Sapienza, and Luigi Zingales have investigated using the World Values Survey. 18 The dependent variable is the question on generalized trust, coded as 1 if an individual agrees with the statement, “Most people can be trusted.” The independent variable is religion, with controls for gender, age, health, education, social class, income, and country and year effects. Figure 7 shows the results. As Figure 7 shows, being religious increases trust in others by nearly 20%. Being raised religiously increases the propensity to trust others by 2. %. As with Barro and McCleary, the fact of being religious has effects on people’s beliefs, in this case their propensity to trust others. The effect of different religions on trust is, however, not the same. As we can also see in Figure 7, Protestants have an increased propensity to trust by nearly 10% and for Catholics trust increases by nearly 5%. There is no significant effect for Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists, while Hindus are less inclined to trust than are other religions ( 5. ). To understand the information in Figure 7 correctly, on average a practicing Hindu will still have a higher propensity to trust than a nonreligious person, by plus 19. % minus 5. % (equal to 14. %). Culture and Thrift Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales also examine the link between religion and preferences for thrift. The dependent variable is the response rate to the question of how important it is for a child to aspire to the qualities of thrift and saving. 18 Luigi Guiso, Paolo Sapienza, and Luigi Zingales, “Does Culture Affect Economic Outcomes?” The Journal of Economic Perspectives 20, no. 2 (2006): 23-48. 


Culture H ow does culture relate to institutions? Institutions can be formal or informal. Culture imposes constraints in the sense that its moral values and social norms influence individuals’ behavior. Think of the constraints religion imposes. Most of the Ten Commandments are specific constraints on undesirable human behavior—for example, “Thou shalt not steal.” Even those commandments that are not negative, such as the duty to honor one’s parents, are constraints in the sense that they exclude behavior that violates the commandment. Because the social norms imposed by a culture create clear constraints on individual behavior, we can see that culture is an example of informal institutions. This chapter provides a brief overview of issues related to culture in the context of economic development. Because it is a topic that economists have traditionally been reluctant to explore, much research has yet to be done on culture in economics and on its effects in terms of development. However, research in this area is expanding rapidly. We will first survey the different measures of culture that research has used and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We will next look at some of the historical evidence for culture’s effects on economic performance. We will then review some of the research that considers cultural influences on development. Measuring Culture People use the word culture in many contexts. Sometimes it can mean cultural expression such as literature, movies, art, music, etc. However, this is not the meaning we will use in this chapter. Nor will we use culture to reference culinary habits, ethnic costumes and architecture, and so forth. Instead, we define culture as the set of values and beliefs people have about how the world (both nature and society) works and the behavioral norms derived from that set of values. According to that definition, culture and religion are closely related. Most world religions are quite comprehensive; they include beliefs about how the world works and they promote specific behavioral norms. However, it would be misguided to equate religion and culture. While religions profoundly affect a society’s culture, we should appreciate culture as a more inclusive concept. The culture of Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists in the 20th century is not the same as it was 8 centuries ago. Beliefs evolve and they can be influenced by events such as wars, social change, technological advancements, or other factors that we do not yet understand. It is challenging to identify measures of culture because culture encompasses many different kinds of beliefs. In recent years, researchers have nevertheless proposed various methods to make meaningful comparisons of cultures across the world. The World Values Survey The most popular database economists use to try to understand cultural differences is the World Values Survey (WVS). It was developed by Ronald Inglehart, a political science professor at the University of Michigan. Since 1981, in a series of 4 multi-year waves (1981-1984; 1989-1993; 1994-1999; 1999-2004), his research

Economic Growth relationship graphically, as the angle going from the origin to the production function gets smaller as k t rises on the horizontal axis. Average productivity decreases because of diminishing marginal productivity: the slope of y t flattens as capital intensity increases. Equilibrium in the Solow Model What insights can we derive from the Solow growth model? Let us start with an equation that defines the allocation of national income Y t between consumption C t and savings S t : Y t = C t + S t (12) Equation (12) is simply an accounting equation stating that all income not consumed is saved. In the next equation, we assume that national savings S t are a constant share of income, with a savings rate s : S t = sY t (13) It is clear that savings increase or decrease with income. However, we could also assume that savings vary with other variables, such as the interest rate or expectations of future income streams, so this is a simplifying assumption. On the expenditure side, assuming a closed economy (with no exports or imports) and no government, the components of aggregate demand are consumption and investment I t . Investment is the addition to the capital stock (assuming a depreciation rate d ): I t = K t + 1 K t + d K t (14) When aggregate supply and aggregate demand are in equilibrium, national income is then spent on either consumption or investment. Y t = C t + I t (15) Using equation (15), we have C t + S t = C t + I t and obtain: S t = I t (16) In a macroeconomic equilibrium (aggregate supply equals aggregate demand), the available funds for investment provided by household savings have to be equal to aggregate investment demand. Using equations (13) and (14), the equilibrium condition equation (16) becomes: S t = sY t = I t = K t + 1 K t + d K t (17) Rearranging terms, we get: K t + 1 = (1 d ) K t + sY t (18) This equation states that next period’s capital stock will be equal to this period’s capital stock that has not depreciated plus the investment generated from the savings in the economy. 


Legal and Fiscal Institutions predominates in continental Europe, Latin America, all former Spanish and French colonies, and many Asian countries. Both legal systems generally meet modern standards of fairness and rely on the presumption of innocence and the necessity of bringing hard evidence to convict a party accused of violating a law. Differences between the Common-Law and Civil-Law Systems The main distinction between the common-law and the civil-law systems is that the common-law system relies mostly on precedent, that is, on previous judgments, whereas the civil-law system relies on a written code of civil law. Common-law countries have written legal codes, but the justice system, legal arguments, and judicial decisions are mainly based on case law and jurisprudence, i.e., legal precedents. In civil-law countries, precedent also plays a role, but arguments based on precedent are primarily used when the written law is not precise enough and can be subject to multiple interpretations. This important distinction gives a different role to judges, who have a narrower role in civil-law systems. Their task is to apply the written law to all cases brought to them. Bright-line rules are precise descriptions of prohibited actions. Civil codes typically contain many bright-line rules that give judges little or no leeway for interpretation. If the law prohibits driving above 55 miles per hour, it is a bright-line rule. In contrast, only a legal standard that states, for example, that fast driving is against the law would provide room for interpretation. Judges in common-law systems have more power in the sense that they must base their judgments on precedents, which leaves more room for interpretation. If different judges have ruled differently on very similar cases, judges in future cases have significant leeway in their decisions. Common-law systems rely greatly on oral argument and evidence. This is an inheritance from the tradition of customary law. Among ancient AngloSaxon tribes, whenever there was a dispute between individuals, an assembly of villagers or of wise elders would hear the different parties and make a decision, relying on long-standing traditions and precedent. This is the origin of trial by jury, whereby citizens are chosen to adjudicate a legal case. It is, in essence, a decentralized system of justice that requires citizen participation. Historically, because jurors were generally illiterate, evidence had to be provided orally. In contrast, the modern version of civil law that was developed in the Napoleonic code and subsequently formed the basis for the legal system in many countries, relies on written evidence. Adjudication is by appointed judges whose task is to implement the law. In the civil-law system, justice is typically rendered by a panel of judges, whereas in a common-law system it is rendered by the jury assisted usually by a single judge. Civil law is a more centralized system designed to render justice in a more uniform way. There is a judicial hierarchy that provides a comprehensive system of legal review; judges in the upper levels of the hierarchy use the written evidence in a case to help them monitor decisions by judges at lower levels. Legal decisions can be appealed and reconsidered based not only on legal arguments, but also on how the facts of the case were presented. This allows the detection of incompetence or poor judicial conduct by lower-level judges. In contrast, in the common-law system, appeals are much rarer and are not

Legal and Fiscal Institutions Statistics to show the importance of total government revenues and tax revenues as a percentage of gross national income. 6 Tax revenues and government revenues are not necessarily the same because not all government revenues come from taxes. For example, in Kuwait, tax revenues are only 1. % of national income, whereas total government revenues represent 47% of national income. The difference is due to oil revenues. Figure 3 presents data for roughly four income categories: low income, lower-middle income, upper-middle income, and high-income countries. Figure 3 shows that total government revenues are greater in the higher income countries (43. % of gross national income compared to 29% in the low-income countries). In a large country such as India, for example, government revenues are only 8. % of gross national income, whereas even in the United States, where the size of government is smaller than in most European countries, government revenues are above 30% of gross national income. In addition, tax revenues as a percentage of gross national income are also higher in developed countries. Even though tax revenues are only 19. % of gross 6 These are data from before the 2008 Great Recession.

From an early age, Chinese children are taught to save money. In Chinese cities, even children from poor families have savings accounts. Even though their family income is much smaller than that of an average American family, many Chinese children have more money in their savings accounts than do most American children. To encourage children not to spend their savings, parents sometimes promise to increase their children’s pocket money by 50%. The culture of thrift taught to children from an early age plays a potentially important role in explaining why China has one of the highest savings rates in the world. This is just one example of the importance of culture to economic development. Culture, understood as a people’s values and beliefs about the world and the social norms derived from those beliefs, has traditionally been absent from economic theory. Economists have been reluctant to embrace cultural explanations as a means to understand questions about development and economics in general. They believed that culture was a topic best left to anthropologists or sociologists. One reason economists have shied away from including the consideration of culture in economic theory is that culture is not easy to define and even more difficult to measure. We can measure wealth and most of the variables used in economic theories, but how do we measure culture? Nevertheless, it is difficult to defend the claim that economists, especially those interested in economic development, should not be interested in culture’s economic effects. In addition to influencing attitudes about thrift, cultural values also affect people’s attitudes about work and effort, the role of women in society, and social and religious tolerance, among others. These values arguably have economic effects that are possibly quite significant to development. Culture plays a fundamental role in other social science theories. Max Weber (1864-1920), the famous German sociologist, considered culture to be a primary force of economic change. In his famous book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, he argues that the Protestant ethic of Calvinism was a powerful force behind the early development of capitalism. Calvinism emphasized the virtues of hard work, asceticism, and frugal life. According to Calvinism’s doctrine of predestination, God selected only certain people for salvation; everyone else faced damnation. Calvinists believed that their hard work and accumulation of wealth proved they were among God’s chosen. Unlike the Catholic Church, Calvinism did not condemn usury, the lending of money with exorbitant interest rates, and it was critical of charity, which it believed encouraged the poor to be lazy and depraved, behaviors that proved they had not been chosen for salvation. Weber argued that Protestantism’s stronger emphasis on thrift and hard work compared to Catholicism’s path to salvation through sacraments and obedience to clerical authority were fundamental reasons why Protestant countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands industrialized earlier than Catholic countries such as France or Spain.

Culture Using the same controls for gender, age, health, education, social class, income, and country and year effects, the researchers found that, compared to nonreligious people, Catholics are 3. % more likely and Protestants 2. % more likely to view thrift as an important value. Buddhists and Hindus are 7. % more likely than nonreligious people to place a high value on thrift. For Jews, there is no significant effect; some value thriftiness very highly but others do not. In addition, a high value on thrift significantly affects national savings rates—an increase of one standard deviation in the share of people who value thrift as an element of children’s education leads to a 1.8 percentage point increase in the national savings rate, the ratio of savings to GDP. This suggests that culture might affect national savings rates as we saw in the example that opens this chapter. Pitfalls to Avoid in Research on Culture Does an emphasis on the importance of culture and its inertia effects for development mean that we should develop a fatalistic attitude toward development? Does the fact that certain countries have inherited cultural beliefs that make them less prepared for economic development mean that those countries are doomed to remain underdeveloped? Not necessarily. Understanding the inertia of culture certainly means that we should be cautious in thinking that people’s values and beliefs can change overnight. We must recognize that these values and beliefs are very stable and do not change quickly. We also must be wary of expectations that cultural change can be influenced in a predictable way. We still do not understand very well the origins of culture or how and why it evolves and FIGURE 7 The Effect of Religion on Trust Religious Significant Not significant Raised religiously Protestant Jewish Catholic Muslim Buddhist Hindu 19. % 2. % 9. % 6. % 4. % H 0. % H 1. % H 5. % H 5% 0% 5% 10% Index of trust 15% 20% Religious people trust others more.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions Statistics to show the importance of total government revenues and tax revenues as a percentage of gross national income. 6 Tax revenues and government revenues are not necessarily the same because not all government revenues come from taxes. For example, in Kuwait, tax revenues are only 1. % of national income, whereas total government revenues represent 47% of national income. The difference is due to oil revenues. Figure 3 presents data for roughly four income categories: low income, lower-middle income, upper-middle income, and high-income countries. Figure 3 shows that total government revenues are greater in the higher income countries (43. % of gross national income compared to 29% in the low-income countries). In a large country such as India, for example, government revenues are only 8. % of gross national income, whereas even in the United States, where the size of government is smaller than in most European countries, government revenues are above 30% of gross national income. In addition, tax revenues as a percentage of gross national income are also higher in developed countries. Even though tax revenues are only 19. % of gross 6 These are data from before the 2008 Great Recession.

The Economic Effects of Different Legal Systems With various coauthors, Andrei Shleifer, a Harvard economics professor, has done extensive research on the economic effects of the differences between legal systems.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions Table 2, the numbers give us the percentage of countries in a particular country category for the particular creditor right listed. There are two ways to deal with a firm when it defaults: liquidation and reorganization. Creditor rights are important in both cases. In some countries, reorganization imposes an automatic stay on the assets ; that is, assets of the firm cannot be claimed by creditors. This prevents automatic liquidation and protects current management. “No automatic stay” can thus be seen as a protection of creditor rights. This is more prevalent in common-law than civil-law countries (with the important exception of the United States) and by a significant margin. Note that the developing common-law countries score even better than the developed common-law countries for this variable. The second variable refers to seniority rules in bankruptcy. Secured creditors, those creditors with collateral rights, are usually paid before other classes of creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. However, this is not the case in all countries. Common-law countries score better here, too. Third, in some countries, management can seek protection from creditors by filing for reorganization. Restrictions on these strategies exist when the consent of creditors (who are generally opposed to reorganization) is required. Here again, common-law countries score better. Finally, in some countries management is automatically removed from its responsibilities when reorganization is implemented, while that is not the case in other countries. The requirements in this category are more rigorous in common-law countries than in civil-law countries. Note that the United States, which is a common-law country, does not score well with these variables, but it is a clear exception within commonlaw countries.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions keep track of those transactions. The government can then use its leverage with the banks to obtain that information. Many banks in developing countries are under government ownership, but even when the banks are privately owned, governments are usually strong enough to pressure them into providing information on their clients’ transactions. When, however, firms do not use the banking sector and rely on cash transactions, it is nearly impossible to obtain transaction information and thus to tax the income of those firms appropriately. As a result, the firms face a trade-off between the benefits of using banks and the costs of paying income taxes. Banks offer clear benefits. Money in the form of bank deposits is more secure, making bank transactions easier and less costly. Banks also provide loans and pay interest on term deposits. More capital-intensive firms that need capital will tend to benefit more from the banking system and will thus pay more taxes. Smaller and less capitalintensive firms will remain hidden from government scrutiny. Following this logic, the more efficient the banking system, the stronger the incentives are for firms to use it and thus to pay more taxes. The extent of the tax base will thus depend on the financial sector’s development. However, the reasons behind a firm’s decision whether or not to enter the formal sector are more complex. These decisions are as much related to the costs of entry as to the benefits from using banks. The costs of remaining in the informal sector are also more complex than just the motivation to avoid taxation. The hidden economy. If we take the size of the informal sector as a given due to more general institutional factors in the economy (and not simply the degree of development of the financial sector), then there is a more direct link between the quality of institutions and the size of the formal sector, and thus between the quality of institutions and the size of the tax base. The size of the informal economy varies greatly in developing economies. The median size of the informal sector is around 40% of GDP in developing economies, compared to roughly 15% in OECD countries. It reaches 71% of GDP in Thailand and 76% in Nigeria. A vicious circle is at play here. If a country has weak institutions, it is likely to have a large informal sector. This creates a narrow tax base, which makes it difficult to raise funds to improve existing institutions. Lack of institutional improvements in turn leads to the persistence of a large informal economy. Finding a way out of this conundrum can be very complicated. Chapter Summary Legal Institutions Legal institutions are critical for economic development because they affect both property rights and the rights of individuals. The two principal legal systems in the world are the common-law system, present in countries of Anglo-Saxon descent and in former English colonies, and the civil-law system, present in Europe, and in former Spanish and French colonies. The common-law system relies primarily on legal precedent, while the civil-law system relies primarily on a written code of law enacted by the legislative branch of government. Common-law countries provide better protection of shareholder and creditor rights, and therefore have more developed financial markets. Law enforcement is, however, weaker in developing countries, both in common-law and civil-law countries. The development of financial markets varies much 


Institutions and Economic Development Review Questions 1. Give an example (different from those discussed in the chapter) of an economic transaction that is more difficult to complete in developing countries than it would be in developed countries. 2. Many solutions to informational problems emerge spontaneously as contractual innovations. Is there a role for the formal institution of law with respect to these contractual innovations, and if so, why? 3. Reputation is important for contract enforcement when formal institutions are weak. Explain. What conditions in the economic environment make reputation work more or less efficiently? Why? 4. Give examples of formal and informal institutions as solutions for the cooperation problem that we have not discussed in the chapter. Explain your choices. 5. Why is the coordination problem important in the context of development? 6. Write down the problem of cooperation for two countries, A and B, in the fight against climate change and use a payoff matrix as in the case of the prisoner’s dilemma. Payoffs are y A ( x A , x B ) and y B ( x A , x B ), where x A and x B can take two values: 1) if measures are taken in the country against climate change and 2) if no measures are taken. What are the conditions of the payoffs in each cell for each player so that there is a unique Nash equilibrium in which no country takes any action against climate change? 7. Assume a coordination problem related to honest business practices, based on the following payoff matrix: What are the conditions on the payoff matrix so that both A and B being honest and dishonest are both equilibria? How would you have to change the payoffs so that both A and B being dishonest is the only equilibrium? What change would that represent in the problem analyzed? 8. Assume that an Indian firm is contacted by a multinational car company to produce brake systems. This requires an initial investment of I from the Indian subcontractor and a variable cost c per braking system. The car company plans to buy n brake systems from the subcontractor. What is the price p at which the Indian subcontractor would break even? At what price p’ can the car company still convince the subcontractor to produce the systems once it has made the investment? 9. Look up the following article by Simon Brinsmead: “Oil Concession Contracts and the Problem of Hold-Up,” downloadable at http://www.dundee.ac.uk/cepmlp/journal/ html/Vol17/Vol17_11.pdf. How do the ideas in this article relate to this chapter’s discussion? Assume you were advising the government of a developing country with oil reserves. What kind of contract would you recommend to the government? Explain. 10.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions about the tax and the price of a commodity. Indeed, the tax raises the price on a good and is thus equivalent to a price increase. Therefore, it makes better economic sense to increase the tax on those goods that have low price elasticity rather than on those that have high price elasticity. Taxing goods with high elasticity will lead to a significant reduction in demand, whereas this will not be the case for goods with relatively low elasticity. The price elasticity of specific goods depends primarily on how easily consumers can substitute other goods for them. Taxing grain and not potatoes, for example, will not make much sense because they are acceptable substitutes for each other. Luxury goods, in contrast, are usually quite inelastic. Tax elasticity is not the only consideration to take into account when deciding on a tax structure. Equity also plays a role. A low tax rate on capital income and a high tax rate on labor income will tend to favor the rich and burden the poor. On the other hand, taxation of land makes economic sense and it is redistributive, especially if there is significant inequality in land ownership. Economic considerations also help to explain the tax structure in advanced economies. Income taxes, which are mostly taxes on labor income, as well as direct taxation on labor, such as social security contributions, are an important source of government revenue. Low corporate income taxes and significant indirect taxes demonstrate that taxes on consumption are also an important source of government revenue. How, then, can we explain the differences in tax structures in developing countries, in particular 1) the lower share of income taxes (but higher share of corporate income taxes); 2) the higher share of indirect taxes; and 3) the higher share of foreign trade taxes? Also, how do we explain the lower level of taxation in developing countries? Why Does Taxation Differ between Developed and Developing Countries? Several explanations are possible for the differences in taxation between developed and developing countries. First, administrative constraints may affect the tax structure. Second, the political economy may account for these differences. Third, disparities in the financial sector’s development might play a role. Fourth, the size of the informal economy may have an important effect. Administrative constraints. One possible reason why the tax structure is different in developing economies is that the government’s ability to collect taxes is limited. Tax collection requires relatively skilled labor. In addition, the government needs taxpayer registries, information on taxation sources, and methods for cross-checking tax returns. An enforcement apparatus to ensure that taxes are collected is also necessary. Given these requirements, developing economies are at a disadvantage because of the scarcity of advanced administrative skills. They have fewer financial resources to develop an efficient tax administration. Tax inspectors are often not motivated to identify and prosecute tax evaders because in many cases, the tax inspectors are bribed to look the other way. Lower literacy rates in developing countries mean that it is not only more difficult to find good administrators, but it is also more difficult for households and small businesses to file accurate tax returns.

Structural Change and Development Strategies Transfer of Labor from the Traditional to the Modern Sector The following three assumptions are made in the Lewis model: Assumption 1 Labor can be moved away from the traditional sector at no cost. In other words, labor can be induced to move from agriculture to industry at a wage level that is equivalent to the subsistence wage in agriculture. Assumption 2 The labor market in the modern sector is competitive so that workers are ready to bid down their wages to get a job. Enterprises in the industrial sector can thus benefit from the excess labor in agriculture. This competition between workers lowers the wage level to the point at which workers are indifferent to working in agriculture versus industry. Assumption 3 Profits from the modern sector are reinvested only in that sector. Figure 3 illustrates Lewis’s idea of the transfer of labor from the traditional to the modern sectors. Figure 3a shows the labor market equilibrium in the industrial sector. It is assumed that the total level of labor in the economy is composed of labor in agriculture and in industry. When labor leaves agriculture, it becomes available for the industrial sector. Figure 3b reproduces the production function in the traditional agricultural sector from right to left (instead of from left to right). 4 An increase in agricultural labor means a move from right to left on the horizontal axis. Assume that w * is a wage level in the industrial sector that leaves workers indifferent to staying in agriculture versus working in the modern sector (at a very low subsistence-level wage corresponding to their living standards in the rural economy). Assume that the level of capital in the industrial sector is at K 1 . That level of capital corresponds to a demand for labor schedule L d ( K 1 ) in Figure 3a. The labor market equilibrium in the industrial sector will be at the intersection between L d ( K 1 ) and the labor supply curve, with an equilibrium wage at w * . Increasing the level of capital beyond K 1 , as more labor starts moving away from agriculture to industry, the labor market equilibrium remains at w * until capital accumulation in the industrial sector has reached K 2 . The wage does not increase before that point because the labor supply curve in the industrial sector is completely flat and labor supply is perfectly elastic. 5 It is perfectly elastic because labor can move away from the agricultural sector to the industrial sector at wage w * without causing a fall in agricultural output. This is the basis for Lewis’s notion of unlimited supply of labor. At this point, our analysis shows that capital accumulation in the modern sector can continue to absorb labor from the traditional sector at subsistence wage w * . If the wage level remains low, the level of profitability in the modern sector will be very high and there can be rapid capital accumulation and expansion. 4 The reason for this switch is to help us see the impact of migration from the traditional agricultural sector (Figure 3b) to the industrial sector (Figure 3a). 5 Recall from introductory economics that a horizontal supply curve means a perfectly elastic supply. In other words, a slight increase in the wage leads, theoretically, to an infinite increase in supply. However, note that in Figure 3a, supply of industrial labor is only perfectly elastic until point L A * is reached in agriculture. 


Structural Change and Development Strategies Transfer of Labor from the Traditional to the Modern Sector The following three assumptions are made in the Lewis model: Assumption 1 Labor can be moved away from the traditional sector at no cost. In other words, labor can be induced to move from agriculture to industry at a wage level that is equivalent to the subsistence wage in agriculture. Assumption 2 The labor market in the modern sector is competitive so that workers are ready to bid down their wages to get a job. Enterprises in the industrial sector can thus benefit from the excess labor in agriculture. This competition between workers lowers the wage level to the point at which workers are indifferent to working in agriculture versus industry. Assumption 3 Profits from the modern sector are reinvested only in that sector. Figure 3 illustrates Lewis’s idea of the transfer of labor from the traditional to the modern sectors. Figure 3a shows the labor market equilibrium in the industrial sector. It is assumed that the total level of labor in the economy is composed of labor in agriculture and in industry.

Institutions and Economic Development Game theory Theory that studies the decisions of agents whose payoffs depend on the actions of other agents. Hold-up problem A situation in which a business partnership requires an investment from one of the parties that is specific to the transaction in question. Once the investment has been made, however, the other partner “holds up” the party that made the investment in order to renegotiate the deal. Informal institutions Rules that are not legally codified; they are based on social norms (or conventions), the accepted and expected standards of behavior. These rules are enforced in an informal way using peer pressure, feelings of guilt, and moral obligations. Informational intermediaries Economic agents such as chain stores or other firms that gather information about the products they sell before offering them for sale in their stores. Institution A constraint placed by law and/or social norms on human behavior. Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, required 36 developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relative to their 1990 levels. Moral hazard Possibility of unobservable actions that one of the contracting parties (the agent) can take that will hurt the interest of the other contracting party (the principal). Multiple equilibria Situation with multiple Nash equilibria that is present in coordination problems. Nash equilibrium Outcome in a game-theoretic situation in which each agent has chosen an action that is optimal given the action of the other agent. In other words, no player wants to deviate from his or her actions given the actions of the other. Prisoner’s dilemma A situation in which two suspects have been arrested by the police and are interrogated in an attempt to extract confessions to a joint crime. Each prisoner is in a separate cell and cannot communicate with the other. They face a cooperation problem and each prefers to confess individually whereas they would both be better off if neither confessed. Rating agencies Agencies that rate the quality of firms, lenders, or borrowers. Regulation of access or entry Rules that govern entry into and the practice of a profession, and require a candidate to earn a qualified diploma or pass an exam as a means to screen out unqualified people. Relational contracting Describes a situation in which institutions are weak and firms tend not to trust businesses they do not know well, preferring to maintain trusted business relationships. Relationship specific Describes a situation in which an investment only has value in the context of a specific partnership with another firm. Return policies Policies that allow a buyer to bring purchased goods back to the seller within a specified time after their purchase. Risk averse Describes the risk preferences of an individual who puts less weight on the upside payoff than on the downside payoff for given probabilities. Risk neutral Describes the risk preferences of an individual who values upside and downside payoffs equally and weighs them according to their probability. Sequential transactions Transactions that do not take place at the same time but rather in a certain order. Signaling An economic term that means taking certain actions to provide other parties in a transaction with credible information. Social norms (conventions) Norms of behavior that are expected from individuals and to which they are supposed to conform. Social norms are enforced through peer pressure. Time inconsistency Circumstance that occurs when the optimal choice for one of the contracting parties at one point in time is no longer optimal at a later stage. 


Institutions and Economic Development a government. Therefore, the rule of law is usually better enforced in democracies than in dictatorships. This is not always the case, however; there can be imperfect democracies as well as beneficial dictatorships. For example, in several Asian countries, such as Singapore, there are political regimes that are not democratic, but they still uphold the rule of law. Legal institutions. Non-political institutions codified by laws, legal institutions across the globe differ in many ways, and these differences can have important economic effects. Some legal institutions are strongly rooted in religion as is the case in certain Islamic countries where Sharia law, expressed in the Qur’an, is both religious law and moral code, and in Israel, where the Talmud is the foundation of many laws. Ancient cultures such as the Chinese or the Hindu civilizations have developed their own legal traditions based on customs that date back thousands of years. Legal institutions not derived from religious traditions fall into two main categories: the common law and the civil-law systems. The common-law system , developed in England and other Anglo-Saxon countries (Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for example), is based on customary Saxon law, the law that existed in England before the Norman invasion of 1066. Legal arguments in the common-law system rely heavily on legal precedents, decisions made in past court cases. Civil-law systems rely mostly on recorded legal statutes and have developed from Roman civil law. Legal arguments in the civil-law system are made on the basis of the consistency or inconsistency of a decision with the principles laid down in statutory law. These different legal systems are important to economic development because the legal systems in many developing countries were inherited from former colonizers. British colonies inherited the common-law system, while Spanish and French colonies inherited the civil-law system. Informal Institutions Informal institutions are those that are not legally codified; they are based on social norms (or conventions ), accepted and expected standards of behavior. They are enforced in an informal way using peer pressure, feelings of guilt, and moral obligations. Even when a country is ruled by formal institutions, informal institutions still play a large role in terms of politeness and civility, hospitality, courtship, traditions, holiday celebrations, and rites of passage. Even in a country where formal laws exist, disputes between citizens are often solved first by referring to mutually understood and accepted social norms. When informal institutions cannot solve a problem, people turn to formal institutions. Informal institutions are based on a country’s culture , the set of beliefs and values passed down from generation to generation. Beliefs concern nature, interactions between humans and nature, and interactions among humans in a society. Values , the intrinsic worth a culture or society places on certain behaviors and beliefs, determine the set of social norms in a society. Religion is a

Legal and Fiscal Institutions based on the determinations of fact but only on the basis of legal arguments related to the conduct of judicial proceedings Another major difference between both systems is that common-law systems are adversarial, while civil-law systems are inquisitorial. In the adversarial system , each party brings evidence to court. The prosecution presents evidence against the defendant, and the defense offers evidence in favor of the defendant. In the inquisitorial system , an investigative judge who is in charge of instructing the case before the trial opens collects all the evidence for both parties. A case can be made that in the adversarial system, each party has stronger incentives to collect evidence, because it can make a significant difference in the outcome. On the other hand, if the investigative judge in the civil-law system finds either more evidence for or against the defendant, or little information for or against, it does not make much of a difference for the outcome; more evidence on both sides will tend to “cancel out” in terms of the final adjudication. There are thus fewer incentives to look for more evidence. Table 1 summarizes the main differences between the two systems. Why do these differences between civil law and common law matter? Economist Friedrich Hayek argued that the common-law system has two major advantages over the civil-law system. 1 First, it gives greater political independence to the judiciary branch of government. Second, it has the property of flexibility and adaptability in terms of a changing societal environment. Let us explore these points in turn. Several elements contribute to less judicial independence in the civil-law system compared to the common-law system. First, the civil-law system relies more on judges appointed by the executive branch of government, which makes them less independent than juries. Second, the civil-law system, with its hierarchy of judges and emphasis on written documents, allows better monitoring of low-level judges by their superiors, making the system quite dependent on the judicial hierarchy. Third, in the civil-law system, a judge has less power because his or her role is limited to implementing the laws that the legislative branch has passed. Finally, add to these restrictions the specific judicial parameters described in bright-line rules. In contrast, common-law judges must interpret legal precedents in reaching their decisions. As a result, legislative statutes Common law Civil law •± Primarily based on non-statutory law: precedent ( jurisprudence) •± Emphasis on oral argument and evidence •± Generalized use of juries •± Accusatorial method •± Less higher appeal •± Primarily based on statutory law: code and bright-line rules •± Emphasis on written record of evidence •± Adjudication mostly by appointed judges presiding as a panel •± Inquisitorial method •± Frequent higher appeal TABLE 1 Differences between Common-Law and Civil-Law Systems 1 Friedrich A.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions Administrative constraints on tax collection are compounded by the fact that it is easier to evade taxes in a developing economy. In largely rural settings, it is difficult for the government to identify and trace income. Because most of the income from farm plots is consumed directly by the farmers’ households, it is challenging to trace and tax. Transactions between farmers and merchants are also difficult to track. In cities, many small businesses are nothing more than stands in open-air markets. Moreover, a large part of the small-business sector is not officially registered with the taxing authority and operates in the informal sector. Tracking down small-business owners is thus very costly and the tax yield from this source suffers. Because of these administrative constraints, developing countries are only able to tax effectively a small proportion of the income generated. Because much of rural and small-business income is out of reach for tax collectors, it is more cost-effective to concentrate on collecting taxes from corporate income and the labor income of large firms. This means that the effective tax base for income tax collection is generally much smaller in developing economies. Tax revenues tend to be lower, and they tend to be generated from the most modern sector in the economy. This results in a significant dilemma: the temptation can be strong to tax the modern sector more to compensate for a shallow tax base, but this may hinder the modern sector’s development. Another consequence of administrative constraints is that foreign trade taxes are among the easiest to levy. Imported and exported goods transit through international customs where they can be identified and taxed. Levying these duties is easier than levying sales taxes on small grocery shops. This is certainly why foreign trade taxes are still substantially higher in developing economies despite the general global trend toward abolishing tariffs. Political economy constraints. There are important political economy constraints on changing the tax structure in developing economies. In other words, there can be powerful interests blocking reforms that move a country toward a more efficient tax structure. The most obvious case is that of land taxation. Taxing land makes good economic sense and land is the most important source of income for many developing countries. However, in some countries, the concentration of land ownership is critical. In many Latin American countries, the landed elite not only have title to most of the land but they also wield enormous political power, which they have used to prevent increases in land taxes. For example, legislative attempts to introduce a tax on land in Colombia in 1973 and in Argentina in 1986 failed to pass. In some countries, protected industries that stand to lose from more foreign competition have also successfully blocked efforts to reduce import tariffs. Underdevelopment of the financial sector. According to Roger Gordon and Wei Li, the underdevelopment of the financial sector can offer a convincing explanation for the tax structures often observed in developing countries. 9 When firms use the banking sector for transactions, banks usually 9 Roger Gordon and Wei Li, “Tax Structures in Developing Countries: Many Puzzles and a Possible Explanation,” Journal of Public Economics 93, nos. 7-8 (2009): 855-866.

The more elastic the labor supply is, the greater the distortion. FIGURE 4a Tax Distortion on Labor Supply w L e L * w H t Labor income Labor supply Concentrate first on Figure 4a. The curve shows the labor supply behavior of an individual as a function of the wage paid to him or her. The wage is on the vertical axis and the quantity of labor supplied is on the horizontal axis. The individual will want to equate the marginal benefit of one more hour of work, the wage, with the marginal cost, that is, the disutility of labor. Each point on the labor supply curve represents the optimal labor supply as a function of the wage rate. The supply curve becomes steeper, indicating that the marginal disutility of labor is higher with every extra hour worked. If the equilibrium market wage rate is w, then the optimal labor supply of the individual will be at level L * . This is the optimal labor supply decision without taxation. Now introduce taxation and assume a tax t on the hourly wage. The hourly after-tax wage becomes w t instead of w. The effect of taxation will be to 


Legal and Fiscal Institutions carry less weight when compared to civil-law systems in which legislation is the source of law. The origins of modern civil-law systems under Napoleon and Bismarck were part of a process of state-building and consolidation of power in the central government with the explicit intention to have less judicial independence. As a result, property rights are potentially less secure against government expropriation in civil-law systems compared to common-law systems. It can be argued that the common-law system is more flexible and adaptable because of the greater discretion given to judges. If the social and cultural environment changes and existing laws become inefficient, they can be challenged and gradually amended or replaced. While the consideration of precedent can result in some inertia in terms of the evolution of laws, it can also give momentum to new approaches to the adjudication of certain types of cases. In The civil-law system dates back to Roman law as codified in the Justinian code. Justinian was emperor of Byzantium, the Eastern Roman empire, from 527 to 565 CE. Monks and priests studied the code during the Middle Ages and the Catholic Church chose to use the Roman law as the basis for its code of ecclesiastical laws, known as canon law. The Church also adopted the inquisitorial system, collegial adjudication by judges, and presumption of innocence. The civillaw system was formally introduced in France during the reigns of Philip Augustus (1165-1223) and Louis IX (1215-1270). It was studied and taught in the first European universities and was thus widely disseminated and eventually adopted everywhere in Europe, except in England. For the most part, modern civil law was influenced by the Napoleonic code, which, in the 19th century, was intended to replace feudal laws with a modern written legal code in accordance with the principles of the French Revolution and its declaration of human rights. The Napoleonic Code had an important influence on Latin American countries that eventually adopted versions of it after independence. It also significantly influenced Scandinavian law. Civil-law systems existed in Prussia, Bavaria, and Austria, and Germany adopted one after its unification in 1871. Japan copied parts of the German system during the Meiji restoration period (1868-1912) when it began to import Western institutions in its drive for modernization. Common law originated in the customary laws practiced by the ancient Saxon, Celtic, and Germanic tribes. Today’s common-law system, however, developed under England’s King Henry II (1133-1189). He decreed that the country’s various ecclesiastical and civil law systems should be unified into a single legal code and he instituted the use of jury trials. Juries were initially composed of local notables who, under oath, gave traveling judges all available local knowledge relative to potential suspects. Initially, the role of juries was only one of information-gathering. The unification of the legal system by Henry II nevertheless challenged the powerful canonical courts of the Church and was heavily criticized by the Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, who was later murdered by the king’s henchmen. The role of juries strengthened over time and was expanded to include a determination of guilt or innocence. Juries were seen as protectors of the wrongfully accused because they would tend to mitigate very harsh criminal laws. The Magna Carta (1215), a charter of liberties and rights that English nobles forced King John (Henry II’s son) to sign, included the right to “lawful judgment of peers,” which Parliament interpreted centuries later as the right to a jury trial.

Culture The Effects of Culture We next turn to culture’s effects in the contemporary world. Does culture influence economic growth or the propensity to save? Does culture affect the willingness to trust people from other countries or communities? Research in these areas is only very recent and fragmentary, but its conclusions are of great interest to our discussion. Religiosity and Growth Economists Robert Barro and Rachel McCleary have analyzed religion’s effect on economic growth. 16 While religious beliefs are clearly a very important part of culture, Barro and McCleary do not analyze the specific effects of different religions, but rather examine whether countries with higher levels of religiosity grow faster than do more secular nations. This kind of analysis is tricky to do because the relationship between religiosity and growth could go both ways religiosity might affect growth, but growth might also affect religiosity. Indeed, the secularization hypothesis initially formulated by Max Weber and reformulated by many social scientists states that as countries become richer, the influence of religion in society should decline. 17 As measures of religiosity, Barro and McCleary use statistics on church attendance and the frequency of beliefs in heaven and hell. Because the relationship between religiosity and growth could go both ways, Barro and McCleary perform an instrumental variable estimation of religiosity’s effects on growth. They use as instruments for religiosity 1) the presence of state religion, assumed to affect religiosity in a positive way; 2) regulation of state religion, assumed to have a negative effect on religiosity because it reduces competition between religions; and 3) religious pluralism, assumed to have a positive effect on religiosity because competition for religious attendance should improve the quality of religious services. The economists then regress growth rates of per capita GDP on the instrumented religious variables, controlling for other determinants of growth such as initial levels of GDP per capita, education, demographic variables, investment rate, openness, and the proportion of specific religions in a country, among others. Barro and McCleary’s primary finding is that a greater belief in heaven and hell among the population is associated with higher growth, whereas increased church attendance is associated with lower growth. Despite the use of instrumental variables, it is not clear that the instruments are unrelated to growth. The presence of state religion might, for example, directly affect economic growth, which would make it an invalid instrument. The results should, then, be interpreted with caution. However, what reasonable interpretation of these findings can we make? People who believe in heaven or hell may have a longer time horizon and thus 16 Robert J. Barro and Rachel M. McCleary, “Religion and Economic Growth across Countries,” American Sociological Review 68, no. 5 (2003): 760-781. 17 Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (New York: Scribner and Sons, 1958). 


Culture The Effects of Culture We next turn to culture’s effects in the contemporary world. Does culture influence economic growth or the propensity to save? Does culture affect the willingness to trust people from other countries or communities? Research in these areas is only very recent and fragmentary, but its conclusions are of great interest to our discussion. Religiosity and Growth Economists Robert Barro and Rachel McCleary have analyzed religion’s effect on economic growth. 16 While religious beliefs are clearly a very important part of culture, Barro and McCleary do not analyze the specific effects of different religions, but rather examine whether countries with higher levels of religiosity grow faster than do more secular nations. This kind of analysis is tricky to do because the relationship between religiosity and growth could go both ways religiosity might affect growth, but growth might also affect religiosity. Indeed, the secularization hypothesis initially formulated by Max Weber and reformulated by many social scientists states that as countries become richer, the influence of religion in society should decline. 17 As measures of religiosity, Barro and McCleary use statistics on church attendance and the frequency of beliefs in heaven and hell. Because the relationship between religiosity and growth could go both ways, Barro and McCleary perform an instrumental variable estimation of religiosity’s effects on growth. They use as instruments for religiosity 1) the presence of state religion, assumed to affect religiosity in a positive way; 2) regulation of state religion, assumed to have a negative effect on religiosity because it reduces competition between religions; and 3) religious pluralism, assumed to have a positive effect on religiosity because competition for religious attendance should improve the quality of religious services. The economists then regress growth rates of per capita GDP on the instrumented religious variables, controlling for other determinants of growth such as initial levels of GDP per capita, education, demographic variables, investment rate, openness, and the proportion of specific religions in a country, among others. Barro and McCleary’s primary finding is that a greater belief in heaven and hell among the population is associated with higher growth, whereas increased church attendance is associated with lower growth. Despite the use of instrumental variables, it is not clear that the instruments are unrelated to growth. The presence of state religion might, for example, directly affect economic growth, which would make it an invalid instrument. The results should, then, be interpreted with caution. However, what reasonable interpretation of these findings can we make? People who believe in heaven or hell may have a longer time horizon and thus 16 Robert J. Barro and Rachel M.

The more elastic the labor supply is, the greater the distortion. FIGURE 4a Tax Distortion on Labor Supply w L e L * w H t Labor income Labor supply Concentrate first on Figure 4a. The curve shows the labor supply behavior of an individual as a function of the wage paid to him or her. The wage is on the vertical axis and the quantity of labor supplied is on the horizontal axis. The individual will want to equate the marginal benefit of one more hour of work, the wage, with the marginal cost, that is, the disutility of labor. Each point on the labor supply curve represents the optimal labor supply as a function of the wage rate. The supply curve becomes steeper, indicating that the marginal disutility of labor is higher with every extra hour worked. If the equilibrium market wage rate is w, then the optimal labor supply of the individual will be at level L * . This is the optimal labor supply decision without taxation. Now introduce taxation and assume a tax t on the hourly wage. The hourly after-tax wage becomes w t instead of w. The effect of taxation will be to 


Legal and Fiscal Institutions Determinants of Tax Structure To understand the difference between the tax structures in developing and developed countries, it is useful to review what economic theory has to say about the determinants of tax structure. First, remember that taxation is distortionary , that is, it modifies the economic decisions of economic agents. Let us start with the examples illustrated in Figures 4a and 4b. 7 Note that the United States has only a retail sales tax, not a VAT, and thus avoids cascade effects. One indirect tax that has worked quite well in developing economies is the value-added tax , more commonly called the VAT . It has several advantages. First, it avoids a taxation cascade that occurs with sales taxes in many countries. Consider a chain of supply and production, from raw materials to final sales. A sales tax increases the cost of production and thus the sales price at each stage of production. This increases the relative price of final goods and thus creates a larger distortion for those goods than for unfinished goods. The VAT avoids that, as the tax is only levied on the value added. In other words, at each stage in production, the value of the purchased inputs is deducted from the sales figure. The tax is thus solely levied on the value that has been added at that stage and taxation cascade is avoided. 7 A numerical example clearly shows the difference between the value-added tax and a sales tax. Consider two goods, cloth and shirts. Cloth is used to produce shirts. Assume that the price of cloth to produce a shirt is 10 and the price of a shirt is equal to the price of cloth plus 40. Without taxes, the price of a shirt is 50. Then consider a sales tax of 20%. The cloth will then sell at 12, and the shirt will sell at (12 + 40) * 1.2 = 62. . Note that the shirt is 24. % more expensive as a result of the tax. This is because of the cascade of the sales tax. The shirt buyer pays both the tax on the shirt and the tax on the cloth. How will things look with a value-added tax of 20%? The cloth will still sell at 12, but the tax on the shirt will now be 20% of 40 (the value added when producing the shirt), that is, 8. The shirt will thus sell at 60 and the tax cascade is avoided. A second advantage of the VAT is that it is more difficult to avoid than other forms of indirect taxation. When paying a value-added tax, a business owner deducts the costs of inputs from a product’s sales so that the tax is only on the value added. One person’s sales are another person’s purchases. The cloth producer would like to “under-invoice” in order to declare fewer sales. However, the cloth purchaser (the shirt producer) has the opposite incentive. If he decides to declare fewer purchases, he will pay a higher value-added tax. To hide the VAT, multiple sellers and buyers must participate in a chain of collusion, which is much more difficult than in a transaction that involves only two parties. The VAT thus has a built-in mechanism to prevent tax evasion. Brazil introduced the VAT in 1967, and since then more than 60 developing countries have adopted it. For example, Mexico, Turkey, Colombia, and Indonesia introduced the VAT when they implemented fiscal modernization and the results have generally been quite successful. The Value-Added Tax

Legal and Fiscal Institutions national income in the United States (much lower than the average of 25. % for high-income countries), average tax revenues represent only 15. % of gross national income in low-income countries. In India, tax revenues constitute only 5. % of gross national income. This lower share of tax revenues in poor countries means that developing countries are less successful at raising taxes to finance public services. Note also that in these countries, there is a greater discrepancy between government revenues and tax revenues. In low-income countries, tax revenues are barely above 50% of total government revenues. In other countries, tax revenues constitute at least 60% of total government revenues. The difference between tax revenues and total government revenues is either related to income from natural resources such as oil and gas or to income from government-owned industries and services. We have already discussed the example of Kuwait, but there are many more. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, tax revenues are only 10. % of gross national income, whereas government revenues constitute 38. % of gross national income due to the returns from natural resources such as copper. The lower share of taxes in government revenues generally indicates the difficulty of raising tax revenues in these poorer countries. Tables 6a and 6b compare the composition of taxes between developing and developed countries. Note that the share of income taxes in total government revenues is very low in poor countries—only 14. %. In contrast, income taxes represent roughly 30% of government revenues in high-income countries—slightly more than double their share in poor countries. Middle-income countries also have a lower share of income taxes. Another difference between developing and developed countries is that corporate income taxes constitute about half or more of all income taxes in poor countries, whereas in rich countries income taxes are mainly paid by individuals. In high-income countries, corporate income taxes constitute roughly a quarter of all income taxes. In lower-middle-income countries, they constitute roughly two-thirds of income taxes. Now consider indirect taxes, the share of which in government revenues is at 30. % in low-income countries and 24. % in high-income countries. Poor countries thus rely more on indirect taxation than on direct taxation. By contrast, in developed economies direct taxation is somewhat more important than indirect taxation. Note that middle-income countries also rely quite heavily on indirect taxes. Another notable difference between developed and developing countries concerns taxes on foreign trade, that is, tariffs and export duties. Slightly more than 10% of government revenues in low-income countries are raised through foreign trade. While this source of revenue is smaller than that from direct taxes, it is nevertheless roughly two-thirds as important. In high-income countries, less than . % of government revenues are raised from foreign trade taxes, making them completely negligible as a revenue source. Finally, consider social security contributions: they are insignificant in low-income countries, but they constitute between 15 and 25% of government revenues in developed countries.

Culture died, his heirs inherited his business interests, making the partnership more difficult to maintain because the heirs might have had neither the skills nor the interest to pursue their father’s business interests. For the same reason, there was no purpose in building large partnerships; as soon as a partner died, the partnership faced fragmentation. As a result, these inheritance laws represented an ongoing obstacle to the development of large and durable partnerships. By contrast, such inheritance laws did not exist in the Italian city-states, where large business organizations were expanding rapidly. Because there were no religious prescriptions regarding inheritance, there was institutional experimentation. For example, the institution of primogeniture , whereby the oldest son inherits the business (or land) of his father, was soon seen to be economically advantageous, even though highly unequal within the family. It allowed business organizations to develop in size and duration rather than being dispersed among a group of heirs, and that led to specialization, division of labor, and organizational innovations. It would be difficult to imagine the modern industrial firm without the historical experience of the large business organizations that had their historic origins in the Italian city-states. Islamic inheritance law provides an example of a specific religious edict with long-term economic consequences. Note that in general, Islamic culture was not, and is not, opposed to commerce. Islam was more sympathetic to merchants than was Catholicism. Nor was Islam generally opposed to innovations in commerce, science, and technology as significant innovations in these fields took place in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages. Economic development in the Islamic world might have been much different if the Qur’an had not explicitly addressed inheritance rules. On the other hand, the inheritance rules were not the only impediment to economic development. Another Islamic institution is the waqf, a religious duty to establish an unincorporated trust under Sharia law for charitable purposes, which would be overseen by a judge in the Sharia court. 15 A pious Muslim would establish a waqf to provide a service allowed under Islamic law, be it the construction of a mosque, a water well, a park, a road, or a school. An important stipulation is that it had to be provided in perpetuity in the same way its founder had defined. Many public services were provided by this method in Islamic countries, in particular under the Ottoman Empire. In a way, this religious obligation can be seen as a way to overcome the collective-action or freeriding problem and provide public services. It thus served a useful purpose, creating a tradition of providing private charitable works. While the Qur’an does not specifically mention the waqf, its pious purpose gave it a sacred character, justifying the perpetuity of the service as defined by its founder. This, however, created an important rigidity: resources were allocated inefficiently when modernization or technical improvements became necessary. Schools could not update their curricula, water wells could not be incorporated into modern water delivery systems, etc. In the 19th and 20th centuries, to improve the provision of local public services, reformers tried to dismantle the waqf system and introduce the modern municipality system, but, due to the weight of tradition, the waqf system remains quite influential. 15 Timor Kuran, “The Logic of Financial Westernization in the Middle East,” Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 56, no. 4 (2005): 593-615.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions more over time than across countries, so the differences between legal systems is less important than it may seem for financial development. Fiscal Institutions Fiscal institutions determine the ability of governments in developing countries to raise taxes to finance the provision of public services. Governments in developing countries are less able to raise taxes than are those in developed countries. Developing nations rely more on indirect taxes and taxes on foreign trade, and less on direct taxes. Taxes are distortionary. The degree of distortion depends on the elasticity of the tax base to taxation. Capital is very elastic, whereas labor and land are less so. Developing countries have limited administrative capabilities. There are political constraints on the taxation of land in countries where landowners are politically powerful and the financial sector is less developed, which makes monitoring transactions more difficult. Moreover, the size of the informal economy is huge in many countries, which makes tracking income and levying more taxes costly.

Institutions and Economic Development Game theory Theory that studies the decisions of agents whose payoffs depend on the actions of other agents. Hold-up problem A situation in which a business partnership requires an investment from one of the parties that is specific to the transaction in question. Once the investment has been made, however, the other partner “holds up” the party that made the investment in order to renegotiate the deal. Informal institutions Rules that are not legally codified; they are based on social norms (or conventions), the accepted and expected standards of behavior. These rules are enforced in an informal way using peer pressure, feelings of guilt, and moral obligations. Informational intermediaries Economic agents such as chain stores or other firms that gather information about the products they sell before offering them for sale in their stores. Institution A constraint placed by law and/or social norms on human behavior. Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, required 36 developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relative to their 1990 levels. Moral hazard Possibility of unobservable actions that one of the contracting parties (the agent) can take that will hurt the interest of the other contracting party (the principal). Multiple equilibria Situation with multiple Nash equilibria that is present in coordination problems. Nash equilibrium Outcome in a game-theoretic situation in which each agent has chosen an action that is optimal given the action of the other agent. In other words, no player wants to deviate from his or her actions given the actions of the other. Prisoner’s dilemma A situation in which two suspects have been arrested by the police and are interrogated in an attempt to extract confessions to a joint crime. Each prisoner is in a separate cell and cannot communicate with the other. They face a cooperation problem and each prefers to confess individually whereas they would both be better off if neither confessed. Rating agencies Agencies that rate the quality of firms, lenders, or borrowers. Regulation of access or entry Rules that govern entry into and the practice of a profession, and require a candidate to earn a qualified diploma or pass an exam as a means to screen out unqualified people. Relational contracting Describes a situation in which institutions are weak and firms tend not to trust businesses they do not know well, preferring to maintain trusted business relationships. Relationship specific Describes a situation in which an investment only has value in the context of a specific partnership with another firm. Return policies Policies that allow a buyer to bring purchased goods back to the seller within a specified time after their purchase. Risk averse Describes the risk preferences of an individual who puts less weight on the upside payoff than on the downside payoff for given probabilities. Risk neutral Describes the risk preferences of an individual who values upside and downside payoffs equally and weighs them according to their probability. Sequential transactions Transactions that do not take place at the same time but rather in a certain order. Signaling An economic term that means taking certain actions to provide other parties in a transaction with credible information. Social norms (conventions) Norms of behavior that are expected from individuals and to which they are supposed to conform. Social norms are enforced through peer pressure. Time inconsistency Circumstance that occurs when the optimal choice for one of the contracting parties at one point in time is no longer optimal at a later stage.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions reduce the labor supply to L e instead of L * . The reduction in the labor supply ( L * L e ) represents the distortion introduced by taxation. How important is the tax distortion? This will depend on the elasticity of the tax base. Look now at Figure 4b. There, the tax distortion is higher than in Figure 4a, despite the fact that the difference between the gross wage and aftertax wage is smaller than in Figure 4a. The reason for the higher distortion is that the labor supply curve is much flatter in the region between w and w t . This has to do with the elasticity of labor supply with respect to the wage rate: a slightly lower wage will lead to a large decrease in labor supply. The extent of tax distortions also affects the tax base. The tax base is what is being taxed. If tax revenues are equal to tL, where L is the amount of labor supply, then L is the tax base. The elasticity of the tax base is the percentage by which the tax base declines if the tax rate increases by 1%. If a 1% increase in the tax rate leads to a decline of total labor supply by 0. %, we determine that the tax base is not very elastic. If it declines by 10%, then it is very elastic. What determines the elasticity of a tax base? Let us look first at production factors: capital, labor, and land. Here, factor mobility is the key element in determining the elasticity of the tax base. Capital is a very mobile factor. In today’s global world, capital can move halfway across the world with the click of a mouse. Investors place their capital where they expect the highest returns, but taxation of capital reduces those returns. Therefore, in response to capital taxation in a country, capital flight might be the result. Labor is much less mobile. We occasionally hear stories of French rock singers and Swedish movie directors leaving their countries to avoid paying income taxes, but these situations are rare. Because of labor’s lack of mobility, an increase in taxation on labor income is less likely to lead to a massive brain drain. Finally, land is not at all mobile. 8 Of the three factors, then, capital is significantly more mobile than labor and land. If a country needs to raise taxes to finance public services, it will be better to tax immobile factors rather than those that are mobile. Taxing the land is not going to make it go away, so the tax base is almost completely inelastic. Taxing capital, however, might lead to capital flight, which might make the country poorer and negatively impact tax revenues. Mobility is not the only factor that determines the elasticity of the tax base. As we saw in the example of labor supply in Figures 4a and 4b, taxation of labor income might reduce labor supply. However, labor supply is, in general, not very elastic. People need to earn a living; in some cases, an increase in taxation on labor income might even cause people to increase rather than decrease their labor supply because they have a target income amount. Capital, on the other hand, is a cumulative factor, that is, capital increases with the amount of investment made in the economy. Because people have a choice between investing and consuming, taxing capital might cause economic agents to substitute consumption for investment. Eventually, this would lead to less capital accumulation. Capital is thus quite elastic with respect to the tax rate and it is better to tax consumption rather than investment and savings so as to encourage people to invest more. In terms of taxes on specific commodities, tax elasticity should, in principle, be equivalent to price elasticity, at least when consumers are perfectly informed 8 Land taxation may nevertheless still discourage land improvement.

Legal and Fiscal Institutions enforcement implies weak property-rights protection. This correlation is thus quite important in assessing the effects of differences in legal systems. Let us now look at the effects of these differences on measures of financial market development. 4 Table 5 reports three measures of financial market development: 1) stock market capitalization as a percentage of GNP, a rough measure of the importance of share ownership in the economy; 2) the total number of listed firms per million inhabitants, also a measure of the depth of financial markets; and 3) total private sector debt as a percentage of GNP, which measures the extent of the debt market in the economy. For all three measures, common-law countries do better than civil-law countries. However, for development of debt, no real difference exists between common-law countries and developed civil-law countries. Only the developing civil-law countries lag behind. Also, when we look at the number of listed domestic firms, the main difference is between developed common-law countries and all the others, although the developed civil-law countries do somewhat better than the developing countries. Nevertheless, the general message is that financial markets are more developed in common-law countries. Controversies over the Importance of Common and Civil Law The research of Shleifer et al., on the comparison between legal systems has been quite influential, but it has also generated controversy. Their evidence on the better performance of common-law systems may seem less impressive when we look at measures of financial development over time. This is precisely what Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales have done. 5 They report two surprising 4 Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W.

Econometric Appendix We thus get: b IV = E ( Y H Z = 1) E ( Y H Z = 0) E ( D H Z = 1) E ( D H Z = 0) The numerator is the expected health effect for those intended to be treated relative to those not intended to be treated. The denominator is a correction that takes into account the difference between expected treatment for those selected versus for those not selected. In our example, because E ( D H Z = 0) = 0, we look at the difference in health outcomes for those selected corrected for the fact that only a proportion of those selected were treated. So far, we have only considered very stylized examples. The expression above for the instrumental variable regression is the one computed in the case of a bivariate regression. We can express the problem in much more general terms than what we have used here. However, the interpretations are essentially the same for multivariate regressions. Let us conclude by comparing the interpretation of the OLS coefficient of regression with that of IV (instrumental variable) coefficient of regression. The OLS coefficient gives the part of the variance of the independent variable that can be explained by the covariation between the independent and the dependent variable. The IV coefficient gives the part of the covariation between the independent variable and the instrumental variable that can be explained by the covariation between the dependent variable and the instrumental variable. In contrast to the OLS coefficient, the IV coefficient only looks at the variation between the instrumental variable and the independent variable, not at the whole variation of the independent variable. For that reason, we often call the IV estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE), that is, we explain the part of the treatment that covaries with the instrument. The OLS estimate, on the other hand, gives the average treatment effect because it takes into account the whole variation of the independent variable. While it takes some time to understand how IV estimation works, in reality, good instruments are very hard to find and requires considerable ingenuity on the part of researchers to identify them. The exclusion restriction is often not satisfied and even if it is, the correlation between the instrumental variable and the independent variable is often too weak. Researchers have become increasingly more demanding of IV estimations. We have provided some of the best examples of IV estimations in development economics. However, given these difficulties, it is safer to use randomized evaluations whenever possible. Unfortunately, that is often impossible and instrumental variable estimation, similar to fixed effect estimation, remains a very useful tool for researchers.

Structural Change and Development Strategies declines as the wage increases. The curve D M is inverted because L M is measured on the horizontal axis from right to left. How do we determine the migration equilibrium? Note first that at L M * , the agricultural wage that would absorb the rest of the labor force is at point A on D A . If, however, there is a wage gap between agriculture and manufacturing, and people can move freely from one sector to the other, many people in agriculture will want to move to the city to get a job at the higher wage w min . Not all the migrants will be able to get a job at that higher wage; the lucky ones will earn w min and the unlucky ones will earn zero. L URB represents the total labor force that, in equilibrium, migrates to the city (see the arrow with L URB in Figure 5b). Because not all migrants will get a job, there will be a “labor gap” represented by the distance ( L URB L M * ) indicating the difference between the total number of migrants and those who get a job in the manufacturing sector. Assume that the probability of getting a job is the same for everybody and equal to L M * / L URB ( … 1). The migration equilibrium is a situation in which no one wants to move to the city. To find the equilibrium, we first construct the mobility curve mob, which includes all the points ( w A , L URB ) at which agricultural workers are indifferent to a wage w A in agriculture versus moving to the city where they get w min with probability L M / L URB and 0 with probability 1 L M / L URB . How do we construct this curve? Start with point M in Figure 5b. This is a point where L URB = L M * and FIGURE 5b The Harris-Todaro Model: Migration with Urban Unemployment w A E w M E L gap w min L URB mob E M A I W A * L A * L M * W A D M D A L M L A Agricultural wage rate Manufacturing labor Agricultural labor Manufacturing wage rate If the wage rate in manufacturing cannot fall below w min , the migration equilibrium is at point I on the intersection between curves D A , the demand for labor in agriculture and the curve mob of points ( w A , L URB ) where workers are indifferent between wage w A in agriculture and income w min received with probability L M / L urb (the ratio of labor in manufacturing over urban population) and income zero when unemployed, received with probability 1 L M / L urb . In a migration equilibrium, labor in manufacturing is at L M * and agricultural labor is at L A * . The difference L gap between L A * and L M * is the urban unemployment rate.

For centuries, and perhaps for millennia, rice has been a vital and traditional crop in India’s northern province of Uttar Pradesh, but rice productivity, in tons per hectare (10,000 square meters), varies enormously within the province. A typical sharecropping household cultivating a modern rice variety on 0.8 hectares of irrigated land will typically achieve a yield of 1.9 tons per hectare. Between 33% and 40% of the crop goes to the landlord and, in some cases, it is as much as 50%. Contrast this harvest with that of Shri Shukla, a small private farmer who owns land in the village Gopalpur in the Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh. He was convinced to try a new variety of hybrid rice (called Narendra Sankar Dhan- ) and managed to harvest 11 tons of it on his 1-hectare farm. Not all farmers are as successful as Shri, but his harvest still represents a significant improvement in rice productivity for farmers across the province. Can it be that private ownership of land gives more incentives to farmers to innovate and work hard than does sharecropping or other forms of renting or leasing land? This is one of the main questions we will be investigating in this chapter. H umans have been working the land ever since the first nomadic tribes became sedentary. Farming is physically demanding. More or less effort exerted by a farmer for fundamental tasks such as plowing, sowing, and harvesting make a big impact on his crops. If he does not plow deeply enough, does not sow carefully, or fails to harvest at the right time, the farmer will realize lower returns than his neighbor who invests more effort in the tasks at hand. Moreover, effort does not always carry immediate rewards. Some farming investments take years before generating substantial income. For example, fruit trees must grow for years before they will bear a crop. Long-term investments will only be worthwhile if the farmer can be sure to benefit fully from their returns. Farming also bears risks. Bad weather such as drought or floods will adversely affect a harvest, while market volatility will affect income. Decisions to try a new fertilizer or a new crop may result in a large increase in income, but might also lead to significant income losses if unexpected contingencies occur: the new crop might not be adapted to the existing soil conditions, its market price may fall, or the fertilizer could create health hazards for the farmer’s family. Effort, in the short and long term, as well as risk, are thus essential parts of farming. Existing institutional arrangements for working the land create incentives or disincentives for effort and affect risk management, and therefore impact agricultural productivity. In poorer countries, especially in many rural areas in Africa, the village clan still owns and manages the land. This kind of communal property has adverse effects on investment in the land’s quality and productivity. Even where private ownership of land is predominant, various sorts of contractual arrangements for use of the land still exist. The most important arrangements are sharecropping, land rental, use of wage labor, and small privately owned farms. As we Rural Land Rights and Contracts

This is one of the main questions we will be investigating in this chapter. H umans have been working the land ever since the first nomadic tribes became sedentary. Farming is physically demanding. More or less effort exerted by a farmer for fundamental tasks such as plowing, sowing, and harvesting make a big impact on his crops. If he does not plow deeply enough, does not sow carefully, or fails to harvest at the right time, the farmer will realize lower returns than his neighbor who invests more effort in the tasks at hand. Moreover, effort does not always carry immediate rewards. Some farming investments take years before generating substantial income. For example, fruit trees must grow for years before they will bear a crop. Long-term investments will only be worthwhile if the farmer can be sure to benefit fully from their returns. Farming also bears risks. Bad weather such as drought or floods will adversely affect a harvest, while market volatility will affect income. Decisions to try a new fertilizer or a new crop may result in a large increase in income, but might also lead to significant income losses if unexpected contingencies occur: the new crop might not be adapted to the existing soil conditions, its market price may fall, or the fertilizer could create health hazards for the farmer’s family. Effort, in the short and long term, as well as risk, are thus essential parts of farming. Existing institutional arrangements for working the land create incentives or disincentives for effort and affect risk management, and therefore impact agricultural productivity. In poorer countries, especially in many rural areas in Africa, the village clan still owns and manages the land. This kind of communal property has adverse effects on investment in the land’s quality and productivity. Even where private ownership of land is predominant, various sorts of contractual arrangements for use of the land still exist. The most important arrangements are sharecropping, land rental, use of wage labor, and small privately owned farms. As we Rural Land Rights and Contracts 


Culture Review Questions 1. Research and explain the difference between the views of Karl Marx and Max Weber on the role of culture in economic development. What is your view? 2. What has Putnam’s research shown in terms of the interaction between culture and democracy? Explain. 3. Culture affects political institutions, but political institutions could affect culture.

Culture changes. The diversity of cultures in the world means that different countries must often develop their own specific legal and political institutions or adapt imported institutions to reflect their local cultures. “One size fits all” institutions do not exist, but there is room for experimentation and cultural exchange. When considering issues of culture, we must be especially cautious not to rank cultures and apply value judgments to them. Even if we find that certain cultures are more suited for economic development as we know it, this does not mean that “superior” and “inferior” cultures exist. There is surely much to criticize about the cultures of the more economically advanced countries, and much to learn from other cultures in terms of philosophy, well-being, wisdom, and virtuous behavior, among other cultural qualities. This should, however, not stop us from trying to improve our understanding of culture’s effects on economic development. Research on culture will certainly be seen as offensive to some, just as psychology, sociology, or other social sciences were initially considered to be offensive. It is imperative that researchers take care not to fall into the trap of stereotypes and cultural imperialism. Chapter Summary Measuring Culture Culture may seem impossible to measure, but several gauges of culture have developed in the social sciences. Since 1981, the World Values Survey has collected survey answers from people around the world on their basic values and beliefs. Psychologist Shalom Schwartz has run alternative surveys on values based on questions that have universal meaning and are similarly understood in different countries. Dutch sociologist Geert Hofstede has developed a well-known database on individualism and collectivism and other cultural dimensions. Culture’s Effect on Institutions Robert Putnam’s research on northern and southern Italy shows that, given identical formal institutions, differences in the culture of civil participation affect the quality of institutions. Empirical research has also found that culture causally affects both corruption and the quality of governance. Different cultural beliefs also lead to different methods of contract enforcement, as Avner Greif has shown in his study of contract enforcement in the individualist values system of Genoa and in the collectivist values system of the Maghribi traders. Cultural Obstacles to Economic Development Collectivist and egalitarian norms in tribal societies have been an obstacle to wealth accumulation and to individuals aspiring to prominence or success in their communities. Another cultural obstacle was the centuries-long prohibition against interest payments condemned by both Islam and Catholicism as a sin of usury. This led to higher transaction costs in financial markets, as agents tried to circumvent this interdiction. Islamic inheritance law derives from the Qur’an and is thus sacred and not subject to change. It has resulted in fragmented inheritance and has been an obstacle to the formation of modern corporations. The Effects of Culture Research findings tend to show that societies in which people believe more in heaven and hell have faster economic growth and that societies with more church attendance have lower growth. Religious people are found to tend to trust others more. Buddhists, Hindus, Protestants, and Catholics appear to place a higher value on thrift than do nonreligious people. Research on the economic effects of culture is still in its infancy and we must be careful in interpreting its findings, and even more cautious before drawing any policy conclusions.

For centuries, and perhaps for millennia, rice has been a vital and traditional crop in India’s northern province of Uttar Pradesh, but rice productivity, in tons per hectare (10,000 square meters), varies enormously within the province. A typical sharecropping household cultivating a modern rice variety on 0.8 hectares of irrigated land will typically achieve a yield of 1.9 tons per hectare. Between 33% and 40% of the crop goes to the landlord and, in some cases, it is as much as 50%. Contrast this harvest with that of Shri Shukla, a small private farmer who owns land in the village Gopalpur in the Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh. He was convinced to try a new variety of hybrid rice (called Narendra Sankar Dhan- ) and managed to harvest 11 tons of it on his 1-hectare farm. Not all farmers are as successful as Shri, but his harvest still represents a significant improvement in rice productivity for farmers across the province. Can it be that private ownership of land gives more incentives to farmers to innovate and work hard than does sharecropping or other forms of renting or leasing land?

Rural Land Rights and Contracts will see, while these farms are, in general, the most efficient means of raising crops and livestock, this does not make them the dominant form of land ownership in developing countries. Worldwide, variations in institutional environments can account for the large differences in the types and patterns of land ownership. Inequality in land ownership is very high in some regions of the world, such as in Latin America, where Spanish colonization has left a deep mark on rural areas: wage labor on large plantations or land rentals to small farmers is prevalent and there is little private ownership of small farms. In other regions, such as East Asia, land is distributed very equally because land reforms have redistributed land from the rich to the poor. Land reform appears to be fundamentally important for the economic development of agriculture in those countries where existing land ownership arrangements result in low productive efficiency, that is, low output per hectare. How do land reforms redistribute arable land from large estates to peasant families? When do such distributions occur? What are the obstacles to such reforms, and what are their economic effects? These are some of the questions we will address in this chapter. Worldwide Land Distribution and Land Contracts What types of land contracts and forms of ownership are the most prevalent in different regions of the world, particularly in developing countries? Table 1 shows some basic facts about inequality in land ownership. These data are not collected very often, so some are old and do not come from comparable years. However, the data are useful because land inequality does not change very much over time. The Gini coefficient is a summary measure of inequality in; Table 1, it represents values between 0 and 100. A higher Gini coefficient means higher inequality of land ownership. Higher inequality of land ownership means that a small number of landowners control large tracts of land, while many small farmers work on modest plots. Table 1 highlights differences among regions of the world in terms of land inequality. Latin America tends to have the highest land Ginis, while Asia has the lowest. These differences in land inequality raise several questions. Can disparities in agricultural technologies explain the variation across countries in the distribution of land ownership? In other words, is high ownership inequality more efficient in Latin America while high ownership equality is more efficient in Asia? If this is the case, what are the technological differences that may explain this? If the variation across countries is not explained by technologies that promote efficiency, then what arrangement is more efficient: a higher or a lower inequality in land ownership? Table 2 displays the distribution of farms and farmland according to ownership and contract status worldwide. Africa, the world’s poorest continent, has the smallest average farm size, at 1.5 hectares. Only 5% of farms are cultivated by their owners. There is, however, also very little tenancy, that is, farmers renting the land they work on from landlords. Nearly 60% of African farmland falls outside the categories of ownership or tenancy. Instead, land is held by means of various forms of communal tenure. In this case, the tribal chief usually has authority to regulate land use by different households and

Culture differences among individuals with comparable professional positions. Hofstede’s surveys therefore focused on people who worked in IBM’s marketing department, the only department present in all countries. (The Schwartz data were collected in a similar manner, as that survey was done only among schoolteachers and students.) To avoid cultural biases in the way questions were framed, the translation of the survey into local languages was done by a team of both English and local native-language speakers. The questionnaire contained 60 questions on employees’ personal goals and beliefs as well as their perception of their work environment. On the basis of the surveys’ answers, Hofstede constructed four basic cultural indicators: individualism, power distance, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance. 3 The individualism score is the first and most important component in Hofstede’s factor analysis. It measures the extent to which people believe that individuals are supposed to take care of themselves as opposed to being strongly integrated in and loyal to a cohesive group, which is characteristic of collectivism. Hofstede’s individualism index is positively correlated to survey answers that put a high value on individual freedom, opportunity, achievement, advancement, and recognition. It is negatively correlated with answers that put a high value on harmony, cooperation, and good relations with superiors. In other words, individuals in countries with a high individualism score value personal freedom and individual status, while individuals in countries with a low level for that indicator value harmony and conformity. The power distance indicator measures the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (both social and familial) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. A higher value of the indicator means a greater acceptance by the less powerful of inequality in the distribution of power. The index of masculinity refers to the dominance of men over women and to the dominance of “male” values, such as assertiveness and competitiveness, versus the “female” values of caring and modesty. The uncertainty avoidance index measures a society’s tolerance for uncertainty and the extent to which members of society feel either comfortable or uncomfortable in situations that are novel, unknown, surprising, or unusual. Cultures that avoid uncertainty try to minimize the possibility of such situations by strict laws and proscriptions, as well as with safety and security measures. They are less tolerant and reject diversity within their societies. Among these four cultural dimensions, cross-cultural psychologists who have worked a lot with the Hofstede data find that the individualism- collectivism cleavage appears to be the most important and the most relevant to understand cross-cultural differences. 4 In terms of the main axes in Schwartz’s cultural mappings, Hofstede’s individualism index has a significant 3 The technique used to construct these indicators is called factor analysis. It reduces a large number of variables (60 in this case) to a small number of variables that are a) a function of the initial variables, and 2) statistically independent of each other. Thus, from 60 variables (the answers to the questions), Hofstede constructed four variables or indicators that are not correlated with each other. 4 See, for example, Steven J. Heine, Cultural Psychology (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2008); and Daphna Oyserman, Heather M. Coon, and Markus Kemmelmeier, “Rethinking Individualism and Collectivism: Evaluation of Theoretical Assumptions and Meta-Analyses,” Psychological Bulletin 128, no. 1 (2002): 3-72. 


Culture differences among individuals with comparable professional positions. Hofstede’s surveys therefore focused on people who worked in IBM’s marketing department, the only department present in all countries. (The Schwartz data were collected in a similar manner, as that survey was done only among schoolteachers and students.) To avoid cultural biases in the way questions were framed, the translation of the survey into local languages was done by a team of both English and local native-language speakers. The questionnaire contained 60 questions on employees’ personal goals and beliefs as well as their perception of their work environment. On the basis of the surveys’ answers, Hofstede constructed four basic cultural indicators: individualism, power distance, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance. 3 The individualism score is the first and most important component in Hofstede’s factor analysis. It measures the extent to which people believe that individuals are supposed to take care of themselves as opposed to being strongly integrated in and loyal to a cohesive group, which is characteristic of collectivism. Hofstede’s individualism index is positively correlated to survey answers that put a high value on individual freedom, opportunity, achievement, advancement, and recognition. It is negatively correlated with answers that put a high value on harmony, cooperation, and good relations with superiors. In other words, individuals in countries with a high individualism score value personal freedom and individual status, while individuals in countries with a low level for that indicator value harmony and conformity. The power distance indicator measures the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (both social and familial) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. A higher value of the indicator means a greater acceptance by the less powerful of inequality in the distribution of power. The index of masculinity refers to the dominance of men over women and to the dominance of “male” values, such as assertiveness and competitiveness, versus the “female” values of caring and modesty. The uncertainty avoidance index measures a society’s tolerance for uncertainty and the extent to which members of society feel either comfortable or uncomfortable in situations that are novel, unknown, surprising, or unusual. Cultures that avoid uncertainty try to minimize the possibility of such situations by strict laws and proscriptions, as well as with safety and security measures. They are less tolerant and reject diversity within their societies. Among these four cultural dimensions, cross-cultural psychologists who have worked a lot with the Hofstede data find that the individualism- collectivism cleavage appears to be the most important and the most relevant to understand cross-cultural differences. 4 In terms of the main axes in Schwartz’s cultural mappings, Hofstede’s individualism index has a significant 3 The technique used to construct these indicators is called factor analysis.

Culture While a correlation exists between grammar and culture, grammar arguably has no direct effect on norms of governance. This means that it is possible to use instrumental variable regression to investigate the causal effect of culture on institutions. Because grammar has no effect on institutions, by regressing culture on grammar, we estimate the variation in cultures across the world that is explained by the variation in grammar. Governance thus cannot cause the variation in culture predicted by the variation in grammar. We can then regress governance on the instrumented cultural variable. In other words, we estimate the part of the variation in governance that is explained by the variation in culture explained by the variation in grammar. This then gives an estimate of the causal effect of culture on governance. When instrumented in this way by the grammatical variable, Licht et al., find that a high score on the embeddedness variable leads to lower scores in terms of the various measures of governance that the World Bank has constructed: 1) the rule of law, which measures the respect for property rights and the enforceability of contracts; 2) “non-corruption,” which measures subjective perceptions of integrity among public officials; and 3) democratic accountability, which measures civil liberties, political rights, and the presence of mechanisms for democratic accountability. We obtain similar results when using corruption indices by Transparency International and rule of law indices by the International Country Risk Guide. Conversely, high scores on the cultural variable of autonomy, also instrumented by the grammatical variable, lead to high scores in terms of rule of law, non-corruption, and democratic accountability. The relation holds when controlling for other variables such as income per capita, inequality, ethno-linguistic fractionalization, and British colonial heritage. The work of Licht et al., thus represents one of the first empirical studies to show culture’s effect on formal institutions. Culture and Contract Enforcement Using an innovative approach, economic historian Avner Greif has shown the effect of different cultures on mechanisms of contract enforcement. 10 He compares these mechanisms between two groups of traders in the late medieval period (12th to 14th century): the Genovese traders from the city-state of Genoa, and the Maghribi, a group of Jewish traders from Northwest Africa. Both groups traded and shipped goods across the Mediterranean Sea, and faced the same environment with the same available technologies. Because they had to ship goods by sea, these traders needed to hire agents throughout the region to manage the transport and sale of the merchandise for them. Both groups had to solve an important agency problem: how to make sure the agents hired would be honest and not steal the goods they were carrying. Greif studied how the differences in cultural beliefs between these two groups led to differences in the contract enforcement mechanism. Under the collectivist beliefs of the Maghribi, if one agent was caught stealing, all merchants would refrain from hiring that agent in the future. Under the individualist values that 10 Avner Greif, Institutions and the Path to the Modern Economy: Lessons from Medieval Trade (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2006).

Culture How can we explain these variations in Italian civil-society development? They originate in the different histories of the northern and southern regions. For more than 1,000 years, the south experienced a feudal autocratic rule by aristocratic landlords, with little development of independent cities. In contrast, the towns of northern Italy developed in the late middle Ages and early Renaissance period into vigorous, self-governed city-states. Although they were not democracies in the modern sense of the word, there was very strong political participation by the elite merchants and a broad class of notables in the northern regions. Skilled craftsmen and other professionals developed various associations, similar to the guilds, and these groups became very influential. Interestingly, in the 12th century, there was not yet much of a development or wealth gap between the north and the south. The north became richer only after the development of the city-states and their vigorous culture and trade. Putnam’s research reveals a complementarity between formal political institutions and culture. The famous French writer Alexis de Tocqueville noted the same connection when he described the vigor of American democracy in the 19th century. De Tocqueville was struck by how well the local networks of social and civic life supported and reinforced American democratic institutions, which were usually based on the social norms dictated by religion, in particular the multiple denominations of Protestantism. For both Putnam and de Tocqueville, a culture of civic participation and engagement reinforced formal democratic political institutions.

Culture prevailed among the Genovese merchants, if an agent were caught stealing, he would be fired. But there was no solidarity between the merchants and an agent who had cheated one merchant could be hired by another. At first glance, the collectivist beliefs of the Maghribi seem more effective as a contract enforcement mechanism. The punishment for cheating was harsher under collectivist beliefs. Therefore, the wage that would convince an agent not to cheat was lower under the collectivist enforcement system. However, in the long run, collectivist beliefs proved to be less effective as they work well only in a closed and tightly knit community. Genovese traders could take up new trade opportunities in new markets when they became available by hiring foreign agents while the Maghribi failed to do so because they were limited to hiring only members of their own community. Let us examine this in a bit more detail. Think of the decision problem of an agent who considers whether to cheat or to be honest. The choice is between a) stealing today and reaping a large sum, but being banned from working in the future and then receiving very little income; and b) being honest and receiving a steady flow of wage income today and in the future. The wage necessary to convince an agent to be honest was lower under the collectivist system because cheating once made it impossible to get a job ever again as no merchant wanted to hire that agent. Under the individualist enforcement system, an agent who cheated and was caught could still expect to find work in the future. That agent therefore had to be promised a higher wage to dissuade him from cheating, compared to the collectivist enforcement system. Under collectivist enforcement, then, the cost of keeping agents honest was lower than under the individualist system. Greif also found that other differences resulted from these variations in cultural beliefs. For collectivist enforcement to be effective, strong information flows between the merchants were necessary. This was not the case under the individualist enforcement system. Information flows between traders were quite strong in the Maghribi world, but there is no evidence that they occurred among the Genovese merchants. On the contrary, these merchants tended not to share information with others. The collectivist beliefs also led to more horizontal contractual relationships, whereas the individualist beliefs led to more vertical contractual relationships. It was not uncommon for Maghribi traders to act as agents for other agents, whereas in Genoa there was a strict social stratification: merchants worked as merchants only and agents as agents only. This is because it was more advantageous to hire a trader as an agent under the collectivist enforcement system because if that trader cheated, he could no longer count on the solidarity of the other traders in the future. In other words, if he cheated, he could not be sure that other traders would not hire agents who had previously cheated on him. A cheating trader would thus become vulnerable to the dishonest behavior of other agents. This represents another harsh punishment for cheating and it created a strong incentive for a trader to behave honestly when working as an agent for another trader. Nothing similar existed in the case of individualist beliefs. It was more expensive to hire a merchant rather than an agent under the system of individualist beliefs because merchants were richer to start with and had better outside options. Indeed, being richer, they could enjoy themselves more when not working, making the opportunity cost of working higher. Keeping them honest as agents would thus have required higher payments than when hiring an ordinary agent. However, the collectivist enforcement system had one weakness that in the long run proved immensely disadvantageous. The collectivist system works

Culture well only within a tight and closed community. The strength of the collective punishment mechanism is critically dependent on enforcement within the strict boundaries of the community. It was not in the interest of the Maghribi to hire agents from outside communities if these agents could, after cheating on a Maghribi trader, find work outside the Maghribi community. Under the Genovese enforcement system, hiring an outside agent was not a problem. When opportunities for trade increased, the Genovese merchants were able to seize these opportunities and vastly expand their trade networks, while the Maghribi were unable to take advantage of them. In the end, the Genovese merchants prospered vastly more than the Maghribi traders. This difference in collectivist and individualist beliefs in contract enforcement in the late Middle Ages gives us a glimpse of the link between the individualist culture and the later development of the rule of law. In an individualist culture, anonymous exchange and trade between people who are unknown to each other can take place. Economic agents benefit greatly from a rule-oflaw system with established courts in which a third party can resolve conflicts. Individuals who do not necessarily know each other can sign contracts with the confidence that they can be enforced without the need to rely solely on the other party’s reputation within the community. On the other hand, under collectivist beliefs, the community polices itself effectively. A formal system of law and courts is less of a necessity. However, a cost results because transactions remain restricted to pairs of individuals who have information on each other’s reputation. An even bigger cost results because there will be less demand for the development of formal institutions and long-term economic development suffers as a consequence. While Greif’s research relates to the Middle Ages, it is very important in the context of current economic development, as some cultures are more collectivist while others are more individualistic. Greif’s research demonstrates how cultural beliefs influence the way contracts are enforced in different cultures. There is no doubt that the quality of contract enforcement is fundamental to economic development. Cultural Obstacles to Economic Development In addition to the relationship between culture and formal institutions, direct links exist between culture and economic development. Egalitarian norms that have prevailed historically in tribal societies discourage and even punish wealth accumulation by individuals. Many religious interdictions have also directly affected economic behavior. Catholicism, for example, created obstacles to economic development, in particular because of its long-standing prohibition on charging interest rates. Historically, Islam has been the source of similar religious and cultural obstacles to economic progress, particularly with regard to inheritance laws. Egalitarian Norms and Development In many tribal societies, particularly in Africa, strict egalitarian and collectivist norms prevail that prohibit members of a society from aspiring to individual achievement, behaving differently from established norms, or becoming

Rural Land Rights and Contracts have also discussed the economic properties of these different contractual arrangements. In this section, we will examine whether empirical research on land contracts verifies these properties and their economic outcomes. Communal and Private Ownership In Africa, communal forms of ownership are, to some extent, still dominant, but individual property rights are gradually becoming more common. A great deal of research has been done on property rights and their evolution in Africa. For example, Timothy Besley has empirically analyzed the effects of property rights on investment in two regions of Ghana. 2 The first region, Wassa, is a cacao-growing region in the west of the country where, traditionally, tribal authority controls the land. The second region is Anloga in the southeastern part of the country where farmers specialize in the production of shallots on small plots of land that are passed on primarily through inheritance. The Anloga region has a high population density. The data Besley used are based on surveys of 217 households operating 1,074 fields in Wassa, and surveys of 117 households owning 494 fields in Anloga. There are no data on the value of investments made in the land, but researchers did ask the farmers specific questions about their investment decisions. In Wassa, they asked whether the farmers had planted new cacao trees. In Anloga, they asked about different forms of investment: continuous manuring of the land, ditching for drainage and irrigation, construction of shallot beds, and mulching the beds. The measure of investment was whether the farmer had made one of those decisions in the last year. Researchers also asked farmers about the rights they had to the land. Six specific rights were considered: the right to sell, rent, mortgage, pledge, bequeath, or donate the land. Researchers also asked the farmers whether they needed approval from the lineage (the elders in the extended family) to exercise those rights. This is an important distinction: If farmers needed approval from the lineage, it indicated strong communal ownership. In contrast, if farmers could exercise their land rights without lineage approval, this indicated established individual property rights. Besley found that, controlling for a number of variables (the average age of the household; the value of durables and livestock owned; the number of years of education for the head of the household; the number of males and females in the household; the number of rooms in the house; the number of fields owned; field area; the distance of the fields from the house; past investment decisions; and village effects (taking the value of 1 if the data were from that village and 0 otherwise) to take into account omitted variables that are specific to particular villages and do not vary over time, an additional right to the land in Wassa caused an increase in the probability of planting new trees by 11 to 12%. Besley also analyzed the effect of a variation in ownership rights on different fields owned by the same household. Investment would increase by 28% if there were an additional right without approval, which is a very strong effect. The findings were significant as they demonstrated how the protection 2 Timothy Besley, “Property Rights and Investment Incentives: Theory and Evidence from Ghana,” Journal of Political Economy 103, no. 5 (1995): 903-937. 


Rural Land Rights and Contracts have also discussed the economic properties of these different contractual arrangements. In this section, we will examine whether empirical research on land contracts verifies these properties and their economic outcomes. Communal and Private Ownership In Africa, communal forms of ownership are, to some extent, still dominant, but individual property rights are gradually becoming more common. A great deal of research has been done on property rights and their evolution in Africa. For example, Timothy Besley has empirically analyzed the effects of property rights on investment in two regions of Ghana. 2 The first region, Wassa, is a cacao-growing region in the west of the country where, traditionally, tribal authority controls the land. The second region is Anloga in the southeastern part of the country where farmers specialize in the production of shallots on small plots of land that are passed on primarily through inheritance.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts privately owned farm, as a benchmark to discuss the effect of land contracts on four important dimensions of farming: 1) effort, 2) investment, 3) risk, and 4) farm size. Farmer Ownership When a farmer owns the land he works, he receives the full residual returns of his labor investment. Because of this he will put in exactly the optimal amount of labor (time and effort); that is, the amount that equalizes the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of labor. The farmer also has the optimal incentives to invest in the land. Many investments in agriculture take time to mature, and a farmer will only undertake these investments if he can be sure to reap their returns. The disadvantage of ownership is that the farmer-owner bears all the risks. If bad weather such as a drought or flood destroys a crop, the farmer bears all the associated income losses. However much a farmer works, he cannot avoid the hazards of nature. Agricultural productivity depends very much on the quality of the land: the quality of the soil, its mineral content, its exposure to sun and wind, the degree of land erosion, etc. Technological progress can improve land quality through irrigation systems, levees, and modern cultivating practices, and fertilizers also help to improve soil quality. However, no technology can protect a farm from the consequences of a drought, flood, or tornado. Insurance contracts can also help, but insurance markets are imperfect and companies will in most countries not insure a farmer against natural disasters. In developing countries, where technology is less available and where insurance markets are more imperfect, farmers must bear even more risk. Apart from the risks that nature presents, there are also economic risks. The prices of various crops can vary greatly over time. Price volatility can be quite high, as is the case for coffee or cacao trees, from which cocoa is made. There are usually no insurance markets that minimize the risk of price volatility for farmers. They exist only for the wholesale traders who can hedge prices by signing contracts on futures markets that guarantee the traders established sales prices. The poor Colombian coffee grower cannot access futures markets and cannot therefore insure himself against price risk. However, if access to insurance markets is unavailable, farmers can minimize price risk by diversifying their crops, especially those whose prices are negatively correlated with each other. In that case, if the price of one crop goes down, it can be compensated for by the increase in the price of the other crop. However, crop diversification is not often possible for poor farmers in developing countries, especially if they own only a small plot of land on which, due to size constraints, they can grow only one type of crop. The principle of decreasing marginal utility tells us that poorer farmers are more risk averse and are most in need of insurance, but in reality they have little or no access to it. Given the limits on the total labor investment of the farmer and his household, there is a limit to the amount of land that they can optimally cultivate. This limit is directly dependent on the degree of agricultural mechanization. A greater degree of mechanization increases the optimal amount of land that a single farm family can manage. If the farm’s basic operations can be accomplished with machines, then it is possible for a single farmer to hold a larger amount of land. However, machinery is not the only requirement; the farmer must also 


Culture large income differences were necessary to provide incentives for individual effort. A higher score means a preference for more income equality while a lower score represents a stronger preference for income inequality. The variation across the world is not extremely large. Note that South Asia, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand favor income equality, while the Middle East and North Africa, East Asia, North America, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia prefer income inequality. The second question asks about support for private versus state ownership of business and its answers show more variation. Support for state ownership is the strongest in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region and in East and South Asia. Support for private ownership is the strongest in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and Western Europe. The next question asks whether government or individuals should be responsible for a person’s well-being. Support for more government intervention in welfare is strongest in the MENA region, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Africa, and South Asia. Support is weaker in North America, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. The answers to the last question show that competition is seen as harmful primarily in Western Europe, Latin America, and East Asia, while it is seen as more helpful in the MENA region, Africa, and South Asia. Note the low overall scores for this question, which reflect the view that competition is, in general, less harmful than it is good for society. Figure 2 shows attitudes related to corruption and trust. The first question on the left asks people whether they think that tax cheating is justifiable.

Culture and North America. The chart on the right shows the positive responses to the statement, “In the long run, hard work brings a better life.” The highest scores are for South Asia and Africa, and the lowest for the MENA region, Latin America, and Western Europe. Schwartz’s Cultural Mappings While economists and social scientists increasingly rely on the World Values Survey, its methodology has been subject to a variety of criticisms. First, the same words may mean different things in different cultures. The meaning of “hard work” may be very different in North America than it is in the former Soviet Union. Furthermore, depending on the question asked, an individual’s frame of reference could distort the data interpretation. For example, in countries with a weak social safety net, such as the United States, greater government responsibility for individual welfare may be desirable, whereas in those countries with a relatively strong safety net, less government support may be preferred. In that case, a country’s local conditions may affect answers to these kinds of questions, and values expressed might not be easily comparable across countries. Shalom Schwartz is an Israeli cross-cultural psychologist who has developed a core set of values that have common meanings across cultures and can provide a basis for the comparison of cultures across countries. Between 1998 and 2000, Schwartz gathered survey responses from K-12 schoolteachers and college students, for a total of 195 samples drawn from 67 nations and 70 cultural groups. Each sample generally includes 180-280 respondents, for a total of over 75,000 surveys. Schwartz’s value survey consists of 56-57 value items that ask respondents to indicate the importance of each as “a guiding principle in my life.” From the data generated by those surveys, he has constructed a “cultural map,” shown in Figure 4, which displays seven important cultural dimensions. In the upper right, embeddedness of the individual in the traditional community emphasizes a high degree of respect for tradition and security. At its opposite are autonomy, both intellectual and affective. Intellectual autonomy emphasizes self-direction, whereas affective autonomy emphasizes mostly hedonism and stimulation. Hierarchy is valued in societies where stability of the social order is paramount. It emphasizes power, tradition, and conformity. At its opposite is egalitarianism, which emphasizes benevolence and universalism. Mastery is about self-assertion and is based on the values of achievement. Harmony is its opposite and fosters the values of universalism. Figure 4 also shows the position of different countries along the map’s axes. The countries with high scores for the value of embeddedness are mostly from Africa and the Middle East. They also have high scores for hierarchy. Asian countries have elevated hierarchy scores, with China being the farthest along on that axis. Northern European countries score high on egalitarianism and autonomy, and English-speaking countries score high on affective autonomy and mastery. Harmony scores are the highest in some Eastern European countries. Latin American and Eastern European countries (including Turkey) are more in the middle of the map and seem to be at the intersection of the primary cultural types.

Culture team has conducted extensive worldwide surveys of cultural values on a number of issues. The most recent wave started being carried out in 2010-2012. The original wave included 20 countries, primarily in European or Anglophone nations. Since this initial wave, some 90 countries have been surveyed, some in multiple waves for a total of nearly 200 surveys. In each country, a baseline questionnaire is adapted and administered to a representative national sample. Over 250,000 respondents worldwide have provided responses to nearly 1,000 questions that focus on personal attitudes about life, family, and society; the environment; work; the importance of tradition; gender roles; democracy and government; health; education; religion, spirituality, and morality; and honesty. To identify any particular value, respondents may be asked to rate their attitudes on scales of 1-5 or 1-10. Many questions are open-ended, while others force the respondent to choose from a specific list of answers. Figures 1- 3 plot regional averages for selected responses from the WVS 1999- 2004 survey grouped under the headings 1) Economic Interventionism, 2) Corruption and Trust, and 3) Attitudes toward Thrift/Work. The first question in Figure 1 concerns attitudes about income inequality. In particular, people were asked whether they thought incomes should be made more equal or, in contrast, whether FIGURE 1 Economic Interventionism 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Incomes should be more equal More state ownership of business (vs. private) Govt. should take more responsibility for people’s welfare Competition harmful Africa EECA North America East Asia Latin America South Asia AUSNZ Middle East North Africa Western Europe Cultures favoring more economic interventionism want more income equality, government ownership of business, and government involvement in people’s welfare, and these cultures also consider competition harmful. Cultures that place greater value on economic freedom want less interventionism. Note that regions that are pro-interventionism in some categories are not necessarily so in all categories.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts of individual property rights increased investment. They also suggested that property rights matter primarily as protection against expropriation. An alternative effect of property rights on investment might occur through the credit market. More individual property rights increased the collateral value of land (the value a creditor could recover by selling the land in case of default on a loan), which would help a farmer to fund necessary investment. If the farmer did not have those rights, he would not be able to use the land as collateral. If this collateral value were the main determinant for the effect of property rights on investment, we should not observe any difference between field-specific rights. A household could use the stronger property rights it held on a given field to secure credit for another field for which the rights were less secure The specific rights attached to different fields of the same household should not matter for the purpose of securing credit because the creditor could take any plot belonging to the household in the event of default. It is only the average rights of the different fields that should matter. Besley’s finding of field-specific effects suggests that the collateral value explanation was not present and that it was protection against expropriation that was the source of a higher investment level when individual property rights were present. In Anloga, the shallot-growing region, Besley found no significant effect of individual property rights on investment. His overall findings, then, are mixed. It is interesting to note that the effects of property rights were significant in the Wassa region, where communal ownership of land has traditionally been more important, and it is likely that the transition to individual property rights in this region represented a more significant break with custom. Markus Goldstein and Christopher Udry performed similar research. 3 They conducted a two-year survey in the Akwapim South District of eastern Ghana, a region in which farmers grow mostly maize and cassava. The primary method to improve land productivity was fallowing , leaving a field idle during a growing season to let the soil retain nutrients and moisture for future crops. This method can thus be seen as a form of investment in the land. However, because of the communal ownership system, the lineage leadership could reallocate a farmer’s fallow land to other members of the lineage. (Note that the kinship system in this region was matrilineal, that is, kinship is identified through a family’s maternal line.) This absence of individual ownership rights may have been a disincentive to investment; a farmer might have been less willing to leave land fallow because he would bear the costs of not harvesting a crop from it, but somebody else might get the benefit if the fallow land were reallocated. Goldstein and Udry were able to estimate the effect of property rights on incentives by incorporating in their research the fact that some individuals in a village were more powerful than others and therefore had stronger property rights. Individuals with more connections to those with political power in the village were more confident in their rights over land than those who have fewer connections and they tended to fallow their land more. Those who fallowed less thus had smaller yields on their crops.

Culture advance for the merchandise and would resell it to the merchant later at a higher price. This was the equivalent of charging interest on a loan. Other loan contracts were written in such a way that a borrower would repay a loan in foreign currency. These loan contracts were acceptable to the Church because they involved foreign exchange risk and the Church accepted that this risk should be rewarded. The increasing complexity of contracts designed to avoid the accusation of usury represented growing costs for both transactions and for entry into business. Gradually, the Church allowed exceptions to the prohibition of usury as it came to accept that any labor in the management of loans could be rewarded. In contrast to Europe, in late medieval Japan, where the economy was at a stage of development similar to that of European economies, there was no prohibition of interest; the use of simple loan contracts against interest payments was universal. 13 Today, Islam still prohibits charging interest on loans. In Pakistan, for example, it is a violation of national law. Islamic banks write contracts that are in strict accordance with Islamic law; if an individual wants to buy a car on credit, the bank will buy it for the consumer and allow the consumer to repay in installments, but for a higher total price. We might argue that these methods of circumventing religious laws undo their economic harm, but we can also make the case that these laws act as a brake on financial innovation in general. Islam and Inheritance Laws Timur Kuran, an economic historian, has researched the reasons why Islam was once a highly advanced civilization but failed to innovate and modernize during the Renaissance. He argues that a critical reason for this is related to certain aspects of Islamic inheritance laws. 14 Neither Judaism nor Christianity have specific prescriptions when it comes to inheritance. In contrast, the Qur’an spells out in great detail the principles of Islamic inheritance law. Based on Qur’anic precepts, Sharia law requires that two-thirds of any estate is reserved for the deceased’s children and family. A daughter only receives half as much as a son. Because these laws are explicitly set out in the Qur’an and are believed to be sacred religious edicts, they cannot be repealed or amended and, as a result, Islamic countries have abided by them for centuries. The disadvantage of these rules is that they tend to fragment property and this has negatively affected the development of partnerships in the economies of Islamic countries. The standard Islamic partnership, the Mudaraba, typically involved only two parties even though there were no legal limits on the number of partners. There were also no limits on the length of a partnership, but in practice the duration tended to be short. The explanation for why partnerships were small and of short duration lies in the inheritance law, which required that when a partner died, his business could only be divided among his heirs. A partnership, then, would usually not outlast the life of its founders because when one of them 13 See Suzanne Gay, The Moneylenders of Late Medieval Kyoto (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2001). 14 Timur Kuran, “The Islamic Commercial Crisis: Institutional Roots of Economic Underdevelopment in the Middle East,” The Journal of Economic History 63, no. 2 (2003): 414-446.

The explanation for why partnerships were small and of short duration lies in the inheritance law, which required that when a partner died, his business could only be divided among his heirs. A partnership, then, would usually not outlast the life of its founders because when one of them 13 See Suzanne Gay, The Moneylenders of Late Medieval Kyoto (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2001). 14 Timur Kuran, “The Islamic Commercial Crisis: Institutional Roots of Economic Underdevelopment in the Middle East,” The Journal of Economic History 63, no. 2 (2003): 414-446. 


Rural Land Rights and Contracts have modern crop storage capacity as well as modern transportation infrastructure to move crops to markets efficiently. In other words, there are complementarities between infrastructure and mechanization: the returns earned through mechanization are higher when a modern infrastructure is also available. As we have discussed previously, the availability of modern infrastructure depends on a country’s general level of development. The average size of a farm is larger in the United States than in Europe, where farm size is, in turn, larger than in Asia. Note that in Europe, as well as in various Asian countries, the size of farms is artificially lower than what market forces could support because farms receive heavy subsidies that allow smaller farms to stay alive. Finally, not all farming operations are easily mechanized and some farming activities, such as growing grapes or coffee, are more labor intensive than growing corn or wheat. To summarize our discussion, with individual ownership, the farmer who owns the land has the right incentives in terms of effort and investment. However, he also bears all the risks. The amount of land that a single farmer can operate is limited. This limit varies with the degree of economic development and with characteristics of particular crops. Communal Ownership Communal ownership is a form of landholding by a village or a clan. Currently, it is still quite common in Africa, but was, historically, widespread in various regions of the world. Communal ownership might create incentives, but only on a short-term basis. If a farmer is sure to receive the fruits of his labor in an agricultural cycle, that is, in the short term, he will put in an optimal amount of effort. However, he will fail to invest in the land because it will almost surely be handed over to another member of the community who will then reap the benefits of his efforts. The higher the probability of handover to someone else, the greater is the disincentive to invest in the land. This disincentive effect is important: progress in agricultural productivity is crucial to creating a surplus so that farm labor can be freed to move to manufacturing and the provision of services. This disincentive can thus have very negative consequences for growth and development. However, one possible advantage of communal ownership is that it can serve as a useful insurance policy inside the community. If different plots have different potentials for productivity, then a turnover may benefit farmers who receive an inferior plot because they will receive a superior plot later on. Because there are strong disincentives for technical progress in areas with communal ownership of land, small landholdings and few innovations in agricultural practices are typical of this type of farming. Fixed Land Rental A fixed land rental is a contract in which a farmer pays a fixed rent to the landlord who owns the land. Farmers who cannot afford to buy land often have no other option than to rent a piece of land. This kind of contract is widespread in Latin America. The tenant in this type of contract does not receive the full returns of his labor because part of the farm income must go to the landlord in the form of rent payment. But the tenant does get the residual return on his labor. In other words, the farmer will receive any extra income earned beyond his rent obligation

Rural Land Rights and Contracts privately owned farm, as a benchmark to discuss the effect of land contracts on four important dimensions of farming: 1) effort, 2) investment, 3) risk, and 4) farm size. Farmer Ownership When a farmer owns the land he works, he receives the full residual returns of his labor investment. Because of this he will put in exactly the optimal amount of labor (time and effort); that is, the amount that equalizes the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of labor. The farmer also has the optimal incentives to invest in the land. Many investments in agriculture take time to mature, and a farmer will only undertake these investments if he can be sure to reap their returns. The disadvantage of ownership is that the farmer-owner bears all the risks. If bad weather such as a drought or flood destroys a crop, the farmer bears all the associated income losses. However much a farmer works, he cannot avoid the hazards of nature. Agricultural productivity depends very much on the quality of the land: the quality of the soil, its mineral content, its exposure to sun and wind, the degree of land erosion, etc. Technological progress can improve land quality through irrigation systems, levees, and modern cultivating practices, and fertilizers also help to improve soil quality. However, no technology can protect a farm from the consequences of a drought, flood, or tornado. Insurance contracts can also help, but insurance markets are imperfect and companies will in most countries not insure a farmer against natural disasters. In developing countries, where technology is less available and where insurance markets are more imperfect, farmers must bear even more risk. Apart from the risks that nature presents, there are also economic risks. The prices of various crops can vary greatly over time. Price volatility can be quite high, as is the case for coffee or cacao trees, from which cocoa is made. There are usually no insurance markets that minimize the risk of price volatility for farmers. They exist only for the wholesale traders who can hedge prices by signing contracts on futures markets that guarantee the traders established sales prices. The poor Colombian coffee grower cannot access futures markets and cannot therefore insure himself against price risk. However, if access to insurance markets is unavailable, farmers can minimize price risk by diversifying their crops, especially those whose prices are negatively correlated with each other. In that case, if the price of one crop goes down, it can be compensated for by the increase in the price of the other crop. However, crop diversification is not often possible for poor farmers in developing countries, especially if they own only a small plot of land on which, due to size constraints, they can grow only one type of crop. The principle of decreasing marginal utility tells us that poorer farmers are more risk averse and are most in need of insurance, but in reality they have little or no access to it. Given the limits on the total labor investment of the farmer and his household, there is a limit to the amount of land that they can optimally cultivate. This limit is directly dependent on the degree of agricultural mechanization. A greater degree of mechanization increases the optimal amount of land that a single farm family can manage. If the farm’s basic operations can be accomplished with machines, then it is possible for a single farmer to hold a larger amount of land. However, machinery is not the only requirement; the farmer must also

Property rights to land are therefore not well defined in Africa in the modern sense of individual ownership rights. Forms of land ownership in Asia are very different from those in Africa: 92% of farms and 80% of farmland are owner cultivated, while tenants cultivate only 12% of farmland. Though larger than in Africa, the average Asian farm size ( .7 hectares) is distinctly smaller than the world average (10.9 hectares). In Latin America, the average farm size is 67.3 hectares, 40 times larger than in Asia! Only 69% of Latin American farms are cultivated by their owners. Latin America has a high level of tenancy—21%—relative to the rest of the world. However, tenants cultivate only 5% of total farmland in Latin America, indicating that farms managed by tenants are relatively small. Given the large size of farms in Latin America, we might expect a larger role for tenancy, but large farms typically use wage labor instead of renting out farms to tenants. Note also that only 16. % of land worked by tenants involves contracts with share tenancy, that is, sharecropping. Tenant farmers usually pay a fixed rent in Latin America. By contrast, the overwhelming majority (84. %) of tenant contracts in Asia are subject to sharecropping.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts tribal members. Land investment is also often regulated at the communal level. Property rights to land are therefore not well defined in Africa in the modern sense of individual ownership rights. Forms of land ownership in Asia are very different from those in Africa: 92% of farms and 80% of farmland are owner cultivated, while tenants cultivate only 12% of farmland. Though larger than in Africa, the average Asian farm size ( .7 hectares) is distinctly smaller than the world average (10.9 hectares). In Latin America, the average farm size is 67.3 hectares, 40 times larger than in Asia! Only 69% of Latin American farms are cultivated by their owners. Latin America has a high level of tenancy—21%—relative to the rest of the world. However, tenants cultivate only 5% of total farmland in Latin America, indicating that farms managed by tenants are relatively small. Given the large size of farms in Latin America, we might expect a larger role for tenancy, but large farms typically use wage labor instead of renting out farms to tenants. Note also that only 16. % of land worked by tenants involves contracts with share tenancy, that is, sharecropping. Tenant farmers usually pay a fixed rent in Latin America. By contrast, the overwhelming majority (84. %) of tenant contracts in Asia are subject to sharecropping.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts It may be that institutional constraints have prevented efficient land ownership arrangements from emerging in various parts of the world. Variations in institutions are themselves a result of history. Communal ownership in Africa derives from custom and traditional social arrangements. We can trace the high inequality in land ownership and significant prevalence of rental contracts and sharecropping in Latin America back to colonial times and, in particular, the legacy of the encomienda system. In fact, the colonial period had a long-standing influence on patterns of inequality in landholdings throughout the world. Hans Binswanger, Klaus Deininger, and Gershon Feder have argued that an important determinant of land distribution and contracts was the ruling elites’ use of coercion and distortions to make large landholdings competitive with small family farms. 11 They identify four types of distortions that ruling elites used: 1) allocation of unoccupied lands only to members of the ruling class, allowing free peasants to cultivate only the less fertile lands in remote areas for their own crops; 2) discrimination in taxation, imposing high taxes on small family farmers and giving tax exemptions to large landowners; 3) restriction of market access to small farmers by arranging exclusive contracts between monopolistic buyers and large farms; and 4) influencing public decisions in favor of rich farmers by directing the provision of rural public services such as roads and waterways toward the large farms as well as through regulations to prevent the mobility of workers or tenants. These distortions have been present on all continents at some point in time. They were present in European colonies as well as in the Ottoman Empire, India, Africa, and Asia, regardless of the diverse cultural backgrounds of the colonies. In other words, inequality in land ownership used to be the norm due to the power of the landed elites, who were able to use both the threat of violence and its actual use to subjugate the peasants. How can we explain why some countries have instituted land reforms to redistribute land from the rich to the poor, while other countries have not? We will address this question in the next section. Land Reform While it can have various meanings, in the last century land reform has primarily referred to the redistribution of land from large landholders to small farmers. This is the meaning we will use in our discussion. The Experience of Land Reform While many large-scale land reforms in the 20th century redistributed land from ruling elites to family farmers, they had mixed results. Both the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Chinese Revolution of 1949 confiscated land from landlords and initially redistributed it to the peasants.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts through additional work on the land. 1 Say that the farm usually produces 100 and pays a rent of 50. The farmer’s net income is 50. If he works more or introduces a new technology that improves his harvest, and gets 120 as a result, the additional 20 in income will belong to him. In that sense, the incentives for the tenant to provide additional effort are the same as for a farmer who owns the land. What about the incentive to invest in the land? This is directly dependent on the actual length of the rental contract. If the contract must be renewed every year and the tenant farmer might be evicted at the time of renewal, then the incentives to invest in the land are poor or nonexistent. The return on the investment might go to someone else. If, on the other hand, the rental contract is long term, then the incentive to invest would be nearly identical to outright ownership. For example, when Chinese agriculture was decollectivized in 1978, the Communist leaders were not yet ready, for ideological reasons, to give land ownership to peasants; instead, they gave farmers 15-year leases, which were reasonably longterm contracts. This had a tremendous incentive effect on Chinese agriculture. Output doubled within 10 years after these long-term leases were introduced. However, while the long-term lease may be nearly identical to ownership, it is not the formal length of the rental contract that is important. Rather, it is its actual—and thus also its expected—length. If a landlord can evict a tenant by threat or intimidation, and the tenant is not legally protected, then the tenant has, in effect, a precarious contract that will negatively affect his incentives to invest. What about risk? With a fixed rental contract, the landlord always receives a fixed income, in good or bad times. The landlord bears no risk, and all the risk is borne by the tenant. But that is also the case when the farmer owns the land. Are ownership and land rental equivalent in terms of risk? No—a tenancy contract is riskier than ownership. Let us take the example from above in which average farming income is 100 and rent is 50. Suppose that income is risky and fluctuates with weather conditions, markets, etc. Say that farming income will be good with 50% probability and yield an income of 125; it will be bad with 50% probability and a yield of 75. The owner thus has a risk (upside and downside) of 25% of his average income, which is significant. What about the tenant? Because he must pay 50 in good and bad times to the landlord, his net income will be 75 with 50% probability and 25 with 50% probability. This represents a risk of 50% relative to an average income of 50. The risk is therefore higher relative to income than it would be if he owned the land. It has doubled as a share of income. The tenant is poorer than the owner, but the absolute risk he faces is the same and thus represents a larger proportion of his income. An income risk of 50% is quite substantial, especially for a poor tenant. This example does not capture an additional element of risk for the tenant: the rent might be sufficiently high that if the harvest turns out to be bad, the farmer will not be able to pay the rent. In that case, the farmer faces the risk of eviction. What about the size of rented farms? They are not likely to be higher than family-owned farms for the same reason that a family can only work so much land. The actual size is likely to be smaller because tenants are poorer than farmer-owners and can thus rely less on machinery. 1 The residual return is different from the marginal return. The marginal return is the return from the last hour worked. The residual return is all the return left after all the costs, including rental costs, have been paid. Obviously, the marginal return is included in the residual return.

Culture positive correlation with Schwartz’s cultural variables of affective and intellectual autonomy, and it is negatively correlated with his embeddedness variable. As a result, we can see that a major cultural difference across countries is their degree of individualism or collectivism. Hofstede’s data have several advantages over other databases that measure cultural differences across countries. First, the individualism-collectivism cleavage is easy to grasp. Second, it corresponds to the main cultural cleavage established by other cross-cultural psychologists in various theoretical and empirical studies. Third, and probably most important, more than 60 other studies done on other professionals, such as airline pilots, lawyers, academics, artists, labor leaders, or corporate managers, have validated Hofstede’s individualism index and found a ranking nearly identical to the one he proposed. For example, across various studies and measures, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands are consistently among the most individualist countries, while Pakistan, Nigeria, and Peru are among the most collectivist. Figure 5 shows a world map based on the Hofstede individualism index. 5 We can make several observations. First, countries of Anglo-Saxon descent (the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) and Western European countries (the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, France, and the Scandinavian countries) are among the most individualist. Other countries tend to have lower individualism scores, particularly in Asia and in northern and western Latin America (Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru). Among the 20 countries with the lowest individualism score, nine are in Latin America 5 The most current version of the data is available at http://www.geert-hofstede.com/ dimension-data-matrix.

Second, it corresponds to the main cultural cleavage established by other cross-cultural psychologists in various theoretical and empirical studies. Third, and probably most important, more than 60 other studies done on other professionals, such as airline pilots, lawyers, academics, artists, labor leaders, or corporate managers, have validated Hofstede’s individualism index and found a ranking nearly identical to the one he proposed. For example, across various studies and measures, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands are consistently among the most individualist countries, while Pakistan, Nigeria, and Peru are among the most collectivist. Figure 5 shows a world map based on the Hofstede individualism index. 5 We can make several observations. First, countries of Anglo-Saxon descent (the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) and Western European countries (the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, France, and the Scandinavian countries) are among the most individualist. Other countries tend to have lower individualism scores, particularly in Asia and in northern and western Latin America (Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru). Among the 20 countries with the lowest individualism score, nine are in Latin America 5 The most current version of the data is available at http://www.geert-hofstede.com/ dimension-data-matrix.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts It may be that institutional constraints have prevented efficient land ownership arrangements from emerging in various parts of the world. Variations in institutions are themselves a result of history. Communal ownership in Africa derives from custom and traditional social arrangements. We can trace the high inequality in land ownership and significant prevalence of rental contracts and sharecropping in Latin America back to colonial times and, in particular, the legacy of the encomienda system. In fact, the colonial period had a long-standing influence on patterns of inequality in landholdings throughout the world. Hans Binswanger, Klaus Deininger, and Gershon Feder have argued that an important determinant of land distribution and contracts was the ruling elites’ use of coercion and distortions to make large landholdings competitive with small family farms. 11 They identify four types of distortions that ruling elites used: 1) allocation of unoccupied lands only to members of the ruling class, allowing free peasants to cultivate only the less fertile lands in remote areas for their own crops; 2) discrimination in taxation, imposing high taxes on small family farmers and giving tax exemptions to large landowners; 3) restriction of market access to small farmers by arranging exclusive contracts between monopolistic buyers and large farms; and 4) influencing public decisions in favor of rich farmers by directing the provision of rural public services such as roads and waterways toward the large farms as well as through regulations to prevent the mobility of workers or tenants. These distortions have been present on all continents at some point in time. They were present in European colonies as well as in the Ottoman Empire, India, Africa, and Asia, regardless of the diverse cultural backgrounds of the colonies. In other words, inequality in land ownership used to be the norm due to the power of the landed elites, who were able to use both the threat of violence and its actual use to subjugate the peasants. How can we explain why some countries have instituted land reforms to redistribute land from the rich to the poor, while other countries have not? We will address this question in the next section. Land Reform While it can have various meanings, in the last century land reform has primarily referred to the redistribution of land from large landholders to small farmers. This is the meaning we will use in our discussion. The Experience of Land Reform While many large-scale land reforms in the 20th century redistributed land from ruling elites to family farmers, they had mixed results. Both the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Chinese Revolution of 1949 confiscated land from landlords and initially redistributed it to the peasants. However, because 11 Hans Binswanger, Klaus Deininger, and Gershon Feder, “Agricultural Land Relations in the Developing World,” American Journal of Agricultural Economics 75, no. 5 (1993): 1242-1248. 


Rural Land Rights and Contracts privately owned farm, as a benchmark to discuss the effect of land contracts on four important dimensions of farming: 1) effort, 2) investment, 3) risk, and 4) farm size. Farmer Ownership When a farmer owns the land he works, he receives the full residual returns of his labor investment. Because of this he will put in exactly the optimal amount of labor (time and effort); that is, the amount that equalizes the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of labor. The farmer also has the optimal incentives to invest in the land. Many investments in agriculture take time to mature, and a farmer will only undertake these investments if he can be sure to reap their returns. The disadvantage of ownership is that the farmer-owner bears all the risks. If bad weather such as a drought or flood destroys a crop, the farmer bears all the associated income losses. However much a farmer works, he cannot avoid the hazards of nature. Agricultural productivity depends very much on the quality of the land: the quality of the soil, its mineral content, its exposure to sun and wind, the degree of land erosion, etc. Technological progress can improve land quality through irrigation systems, levees, and modern cultivating practices, and fertilizers also help to improve soil quality. However, no technology can protect a farm from the consequences of a drought, flood, or tornado. Insurance contracts can also help, but insurance markets are imperfect and companies will in most countries not insure a farmer against natural disasters. In developing countries, where technology is less available and where insurance markets are more imperfect, farmers must bear even more risk. Apart from the risks that nature presents, there are also economic risks. The prices of various crops can vary greatly over time. Price volatility can be quite high, as is the case for coffee or cacao trees, from which cocoa is made. There are usually no insurance markets that minimize the risk of price volatility for farmers. They exist only for the wholesale traders who can hedge prices by signing contracts on futures markets that guarantee the traders established sales prices. The poor Colombian coffee grower cannot access futures markets and cannot therefore insure himself against price risk. However, if access to insurance markets is unavailable, farmers can minimize price risk by diversifying their crops, especially those whose prices are negatively correlated with each other. In that case, if the price of one crop goes down, it can be compensated for by the increase in the price of the other crop. However, crop diversification is not often possible for poor farmers in developing countries, especially if they own only a small plot of land on which, due to size constraints, they can grow only one type of crop. The principle of decreasing marginal utility tells us that poorer farmers are more risk averse and are most in need of insurance, but in reality they have little or no access to it. Given the limits on the total labor investment of the farmer and his household, there is a limit to the amount of land that they can optimally cultivate. This limit is directly dependent on the degree of agricultural mechanization. A greater degree of mechanization increases the optimal amount of land that a single farm family can manage. If the farm’s basic operations can be accomplished with machines, then it is possible for a single farmer to hold a larger amount of land. However, machinery is not the only requirement; the farmer must also

Rural Land Rights and Contracts have also discussed the economic properties of these different contractual arrangements. In this section, we will examine whether empirical research on land contracts verifies these properties and their economic outcomes. Communal and Private Ownership In Africa, communal forms of ownership are, to some extent, still dominant, but individual property rights are gradually becoming more common. A great deal of research has been done on property rights and their evolution in Africa. For example, Timothy Besley has empirically analyzed the effects of property rights on investment in two regions of Ghana. 2 The first region, Wassa, is a cacao-growing region in the west of the country where, traditionally, tribal authority controls the land. The second region is Anloga in the southeastern part of the country where farmers specialize in the production of shallots on small plots of land that are passed on primarily through inheritance. The Anloga region has a high population density. The data Besley used are based on surveys of 217 households operating 1,074 fields in Wassa, and surveys of 117 households owning 494 fields in Anloga. There are no data on the value of investments made in the land, but researchers did ask the farmers specific questions about their investment decisions. In Wassa, they asked whether the farmers had planted new cacao trees. In Anloga, they asked about different forms of investment: continuous manuring of the land, ditching for drainage and irrigation, construction of shallot beds, and mulching the beds. The measure of investment was whether the farmer had made one of those decisions in the last year. Researchers also asked farmers about the rights they had to the land. Six specific rights were considered: the right to sell, rent, mortgage, pledge, bequeath, or donate the land. Researchers also asked the farmers whether they needed approval from the lineage (the elders in the extended family) to exercise those rights. This is an important distinction: If farmers needed approval from the lineage, it indicated strong communal ownership. In contrast, if farmers could exercise their land rights without lineage approval, this indicated established individual property rights. Besley found that, controlling for a number of variables (the average age of the household; the value of durables and livestock owned; the number of years of education for the head of the household; the number of males and females in the household; the number of rooms in the house; the number of fields owned; field area; the distance of the fields from the house; past investment decisions; and village effects (taking the value of 1 if the data were from that village and 0 otherwise) to take into account omitted variables that are specific to particular villages and do not vary over time, an additional right to the land in Wassa caused an increase in the probability of planting new trees by 11 to 12%. Besley also analyzed the effect of a variation in ownership rights on different fields owned by the same household. Investment would increase by 28% if there were an additional right without approval, which is a very strong effect. The findings were significant as they demonstrated how the protection 2 Timothy Besley, “Property Rights and Investment Incentives: Theory and Evidence from Ghana,” Journal of Political Economy 103, no. 5 (1995): 903-937.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts of individual property rights increased investment. They also suggested that property rights matter primarily as protection against expropriation. An alternative effect of property rights on investment might occur through the credit market. More individual property rights increased the collateral value of land (the value a creditor could recover by selling the land in case of default on a loan), which would help a farmer to fund necessary investment. If the farmer did not have those rights, he would not be able to use the land as collateral. If this collateral value were the main determinant for the effect of property rights on investment, we should not observe any difference between field-specific rights. A household could use the stronger property rights it held on a given field to secure credit for another field for which the rights were less secure The specific rights attached to different fields of the same household should not matter for the purpose of securing credit because the creditor could take any plot belonging to the household in the event of default. It is only the average rights of the different fields that should matter. Besley’s finding of field-specific effects suggests that the collateral value explanation was not present and that it was protection against expropriation that was the source of a higher investment level when individual property rights were present. In Anloga, the shallot-growing region, Besley found no significant effect of individual property rights on investment. His overall findings, then, are mixed. It is interesting to note that the effects of property rights were significant in the Wassa region, where communal ownership of land has traditionally been more important, and it is likely that the transition to individual property rights in this region represented a more significant break with custom. Markus Goldstein and Christopher Udry performed similar research. 3 They conducted a two-year survey in the Akwapim South District of eastern Ghana, a region in which farmers grow mostly maize and cassava. The primary method to improve land productivity was fallowing , leaving a field idle during a growing season to let the soil retain nutrients and moisture for future crops. This method can thus be seen as a form of investment in the land. However, because of the communal ownership system, the lineage leadership could reallocate a farmer’s fallow land to other members of the lineage. (Note that the kinship system in this region was matrilineal, that is, kinship is identified through a family’s maternal line.) This absence of individual ownership rights may have been a disincentive to investment; a farmer might have been less willing to leave land fallow because he would bear the costs of not harvesting a crop from it, but somebody else might get the benefit if the fallow land were reallocated. Goldstein and Udry were able to estimate the effect of property rights on incentives by incorporating in their research the fact that some individuals in a village were more powerful than others and therefore had stronger property rights. Individuals with more connections to those with political power in the village were more confident in their rights over land than those who have fewer connections and they tended to fallow their land more. Those who fallowed less thus had smaller yields on their crops.

Culture prosperous. 11 These social norms are transmitted from generation to generation and have a significant effect on individual behavior. Exceptionally productive individuals are viewed with suspicion and are pressured into sharing their surplus with the community. Collective punishments exist to penalize the rich; they take the form of social ostracism, loss of status, or even violence. One form of social ostracism is to boycott the funerals for relatives of richer farmers. Communities have also frequently used accusations of witchcraft to punish greed and acquisitiveness as well as attempts to move away from the community. Poisoning the cattle of more affluent individuals has even been used as both punishment and threat in various African communities. Motivating this repression of any kind of economic or social differentiation is the fear that individuals will start to compete and the community’s cohesiveness will be undermined as a result. There is also a concern that an individual who proves more successful will leave the village or will not redistribute any surplus harvest or other production. Finally, poor villagers believe that if they borrow money from richer individuals they are under no ethical obligation to repay, a norm that acts as an obstacle to the development of credit inside these traditional communities. Such norms are likely to have a negative effect on economic development because they tend to prevent individuals from excelling in productivity or innovation. They tend to repress the entrepreneurial spirit and incentives to modernize, which perpetuate poverty and stagnation. On the other hand, in a case of significant resource scarcity, such collectivist norms will lead to an egalitarian distribution of food, leading in turn to survival for a larger number of community members. These norms were no doubt quite effective in ancient times and the tribes in which they prevailed had, in all likelihood, a higher survival rate than tribes with less collectivist norms. Religious Taboos on Interest For centuries, the Catholic Church has prohibited its members from charging interest on a loan. This was called the sin of usury and many of the Church’s prominent theologians, such as Saint Thomas Aquinas, wrote against it. For centuries, Catholics considered it immoral because they believed the interest was not the result of effort or labor. Some scholars have argued that this religious prohibition created an obstacle to the development of financial markets. Historian Raymond de Roover, who studied financial development in medieval Europe, argued that the ban on usury increased transaction costs. 12 In Italy, for example, merchants who wanted to avoid the accusation of usury had to draw up complex contracts. For example, if a merchant needed a loan to buy some merchandise, he entered into a contract with a bank wherein the bank, rather than the merchant, would pay in 11 See Jean-Philippe Platteau, Institutions, Social Norms, and Economic Development ( Newark, NJ: Harwood Academic Publishers, 2000). 12 Raymond De Roover, The Rise and Decline of the Medici Bank, 1397-1494 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963).

For example, if a merchant needed a loan to buy some merchandise, he entered into a contract with a bank wherein the bank, rather than the merchant, would pay in 11 See Jean-Philippe Platteau, Institutions, Social Norms, and Economic Development ( Newark, NJ: Harwood Academic Publishers, 2000). 12 Raymond De Roover, The Rise and Decline of the Medici Bank, 1397-1494 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963).

Rural Land Rights and Contracts A more recent study by Mark Rosenzweig and Hans Binswanger using the ICRISAT data on rural India, which contains information on the total wealth of farmers, also confirms an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity. 10 They find a systematically higher level of profit per unit of inherited wealth for small farmers than for wealthier farmers. Note that in this rural context, wealth and land size are almost perfectly correlated. However, they also find that smaller farmers face more risk as measured by the volatility of the onset of the monsoon (measured by its standard deviation), the rainy season. As the volatility of the monsoon increases, the profit of small farmers falls much faster than that of wealthier farmers even though the profit of the former remains higher than that of the latter. While it is possible to argue that larger farms can benefit from economies of scale, the empirical evidence shows that incentives for those who work the land are the most important determinant of farm productivity. The evidence to date suggests that individual ownership is the most efficient form of agricultural organization because of the strong incentives associated with it. Institutions and Patterns of Land Inequality and Land Contracts Both theory and evidence strongly suggest that individual and family farming are more efficient than other contractual land arrangements. The size of family farms should, in theory, be a function of technological progress. However, it would seem that no difference in the natural endowments of land or in climate conditions (which may have different effects on farm work conditions across the world) can explain the large variation in the distribution pattern of contractual arrangements. This is an important point: if variations in land quality and in climate offer no convincing explanation for differences in land ownership and land contracts around the world, then variations in institutions would appear to play a major role in explaining these differences in land ownership. 10 Mark R.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts result of fallowing less was estimated at one-third of a plot’s output and it represented a sizeable effect on incentives. The researchers also found that when farmers obtained plots through commercial transactions (through rental and sharecropping contracts), the plots were fallowed for more than 6 months longer than plots allocated through the lineage. This also indicated the advantage of individual over communal ownership. Rohini Pande and Christopher Udry analyzed the evolution of the property rights system in the same regions of Ghana. 4 The communal system evolved in a time of land abundance, when there was always enough land for everyone and land could be left fallow for longer periods without resulting in a loss of income. However, as population density increased and land became less abundant, the efficiency losses associated with insecure property rights took effect, and fallow periods became considerably shorter. However, as land became scarcer, pressures for more secure property rights grew. Areas with higher population density tended to have a higher proportion of cultivated land secured through commercial contracts. Sharecropping Compared to Privately Owned Farms Some studies have compared the efficiency of sharecropping to private ownership. Radwan Ali Shaban, using data from India, has shown that productivity is lower with sharecropping than with land ownership. 5 Shaban’s research was quite influential as the effect on productivity is, in general, not easy to estimate econometrically because a lower productivity on sharecropped land may be due to factors other than incentives alone. Farmers who were owners may for example have been more entrepreneurial, energetic, and less risk averse than sharecroppers. Shaban was able to estimate the effects on productivity of sharecropping versus private ownership because he was able to control for land quality, but the most ingenious part of his research design was that he was able to exploit the fact that the same farmer quite often worked some land that he sharecropped simultaneously with other land that he owned. The data Shaban used in his study came from a previous village-level study done in India by ICRISAT (the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics). Researchers selected three different agro-climatic zones from the three provinces of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. They selected two representative villages in specific districts of these provinces. In each village, they randomly chose households and followed them between 1975 and either 1979 or 1982. What is quite unique about these data was that many individuals cultivated both their own plots and plots that they rented with a sharecropping contract. Any difference in productivity on owned versus sharecropped land should therefore not be related to differences in the individual characteristics of farmers (risk attitude, ability, strength, etc.).

Rural Land Rights and Contracts found that a farmer’s productivity was lower on plots that he sharecropped compared to plots that he owned, controlling for possible differences in the quality of land (plot value, soil type, and area irrigated). On the whole, he found that output per acre on owned land was 16. % higher on average compared to sharecropped plots. He also showed that there was less input intensity (fertilizer, seeds, and other improvements) on sharecropped land. Looking only at sorghum plots, output per acre was nearly 30% higher on owned plots. Sharecropping Compared to Fixed Rental Contracts In a Tunisian study, Jean-Jaques Laffont and Mohamed Salah Matoussi compared sharecropping with fixed rental contracts and also estimated the effect of the length of tenancy contracts. 6 They used data from a 1986 survey in a rural area called El Oulja, 40 miles west of Tunis. Researchers interviewed 100 families and gathered information about their wealth and income, and the number of days each year they worked in agriculture. The researchers also gathered information about each plot of land, which included the plot’s size, the type of crop grown on it, the type of contract (fixed rental or sharecropping) that secured its use, output levels, and information on labor and other inputs to the land. Their principal finding, in line with economic theory, was that output was 50% higher under a fixed rental contract compared to a sharecropping contract. Also, a 3-year sharecropping contract increased production by 38% compared to a 1-year contract. Plantations and Slave Labor Beyond its ethical issues, the standard economic view on slavery has always been that it was extremely inefficient given the absence of incentives for slaves. It therefore had to rely only on supervision, which was often brutal, but also necessarily imperfect since it is very difficult to monitor closely, and all day long, how hard somebody works on the land. Economic historians Fogel and Engerman have, however, argued that productivity on slave plantations in the southern United States was higher than on free farms both in the South and in the North. 7 Using historical data, they computed an index of farm productivity that was a geometrical average of labor productivity, capital productivity, and land productivity. They found that slave-labor farms were 40% more productive than farms owned or worked by freemen in the North and 28% more productive than freemen farms in the South. They argued that this was primarily due to the ability to organize the slaves in work gangs in which there was an extreme division of labor, with several slaves performing the same task who were required to move in rhythm.

Culture and eight are in Asia. Note, however, that there is also sufficient variation within continents. In Africa, the more individualistic countries are South Africa, Morocco, and Libya, and the more collectivist countries are Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. In Latin America, the more individualistic countries are Argentina and Brazil, who are in the middle range of the individualism score, and the most collectivist countries are Guatemala and Ecuador. In Asia, the most individualistic country is India and the most collectivist countries are Indonesia and Pakistan. In Europe, Portugal has a low individualism score, in the same range as Kenya or Zambia, as do Bulgaria and Romania with individualism scores close to that of Mexico. While Hofstede’s data have been widely used in the social sciences, economists are starting to use them to analyze the effect of individualism on entrepreneurship, technical diffusion, growth and development, and institutions. 6 Culture’s Effect on Institutions What is the relationship between culture on one hand and political and legal institutions on the other? We provide some clear evidence that a strong culture of democracy is correlated with more efficient provision of public services and improved functioning of government institutions. We also demonstrate that culture, because it evolves more slowly than do formal institutions, has a causal effect on these institutions of governance. Culture and the Quality of Democracy In an influential book, political scientist Robert Putnam and his research colleagues put forward the idea that there is a strong link between the development of civil society , that is, the presence of a network of diverse voluntary associations, and the success of democratic institutions. 7 The development of civil society is associated with a culture of democratic participation in which citizens believe that they must be actively involved in civil associations. In other words, for democracy to work well, citizens need to participate actively in social life through a complex associative network. Putnam’s research is based on data gathered in Italy. Although Italy is not a developing economy, economically, southern Italy has always lagged behind 6 For the effects of individualism on entrepreneurship, see Michael H. Morris, Duane L.

Their principal finding, in line with economic theory, was that output was 50% higher under a fixed rental contract compared to a sharecropping contract. Also, a 3-year sharecropping contract increased production by 38% compared to a 1-year contract. Plantations and Slave Labor Beyond its ethical issues, the standard economic view on slavery has always been that it was extremely inefficient given the absence of incentives for slaves. It therefore had to rely only on supervision, which was often brutal, but also necessarily imperfect since it is very difficult to monitor closely, and all day long, how hard somebody works on the land. Economic historians Fogel and Engerman have, however, argued that productivity on slave plantations in the southern United States was higher than on free farms both in the South and in the North. 7 Using historical data, they computed an index of farm productivity that was a geometrical average of labor productivity, capital productivity, and land productivity. They found that slave-labor farms were 40% more productive than farms owned or worked by freemen in the North and 28% more productive than freemen farms in the South. They argued that this was primarily due to the ability to organize the slaves in work gangs in which there was an extreme division of labor, with several slaves performing the same task who were required to move in rhythm. For example, to harvest cotton, rows of 6 Jean-Jaques Laffont and Mohamed Salah Matoussi, “Moral Hazard, Financial Constraints and Sharecropping in El Oulja,” The Review of Economic Studies 62, no. 3 (1995): 381-399. 7 Robert W.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts result of fallowing less was estimated at one-third of a plot’s output and it represented a sizeable effect on incentives. The researchers also found that when farmers obtained plots through commercial transactions (through rental and sharecropping contracts), the plots were fallowed for more than 6 months longer than plots allocated through the lineage. This also indicated the advantage of individual over communal ownership. Rohini Pande and Christopher Udry analyzed the evolution of the property rights system in the same regions of Ghana. 4 The communal system evolved in a time of land abundance, when there was always enough land for everyone and land could be left fallow for longer periods without resulting in a loss of income. However, as population density increased and land became less abundant, the efficiency losses associated with insecure property rights took effect, and fallow periods became considerably shorter. However, as land became scarcer, pressures for more secure property rights grew. Areas with higher population density tended to have a higher proportion of cultivated land secured through commercial contracts. Sharecropping Compared to Privately Owned Farms Some studies have compared the efficiency of sharecropping to private ownership. Radwan Ali Shaban, using data from India, has shown that productivity is lower with sharecropping than with land ownership. 5 Shaban’s research was quite influential as the effect on productivity is, in general, not easy to estimate econometrically because a lower productivity on sharecropped land may be due to factors other than incentives alone. Farmers who were owners may for example have been more entrepreneurial, energetic, and less risk averse than sharecroppers. Shaban was able to estimate the effects on productivity of sharecropping versus private ownership because he was able to control for land quality, but the most ingenious part of his research design was that he was able to exploit the fact that the same farmer quite often worked some land that he sharecropped simultaneously with other land that he owned. The data Shaban used in his study came from a previous village-level study done in India by ICRISAT (the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics). Researchers selected three different agro-climatic zones from the three provinces of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. They selected two representative villages in specific districts of these provinces. In each village, they randomly chose households and followed them between 1975 and either 1979 or 1982. What is quite unique about these data was that many individuals cultivated both their own plots and plots that they rented with a sharecropping contract. Any difference in productivity on owned versus sharecropped land should therefore not be related to differences in the individual characteristics of farmers (risk attitude, ability, strength, etc.). Using the ICRISAT data, Shaban 4 Rohini Pande and Christopher Udry, “Institutions and Development: A View from Below,” in Advances in Economics and Econometrics, ed. Richard Blundell, Whitney K.

Culture northern Italy. While the northern regions of Italy are among the richest in the world, the southern Mezzogiorno region has a GDP per capita closer to that of Argentina, Mauritius, or Poland. Italy is an interesting case to consider in terms of the functions of formal and informal institutions. The same formal political and legal institutions exist in both the north and the south. However, the efficiency of government institutions in the southern regions is much lower than for those in the north. Putnam constructed a number of indicators to measure this difference in performance. He concluded that the Mezzogiorno had much higher instability (i.e., turnover) of regional governments, more delay in budget approval by local governments, a worse statistical apparatus, a lower quality of legislation, and a lower provision of public services. Let us examine more closely the issue of an inferior provision of public services. In 1977, the central government made funding available to set up daycare centers throughout the country. By 1983, Emilia Romagna (the Bologna region) in the north had set up a daycare center for every 400 children, whereas Campania (the Naples region) in the south had only one center for every 12,560 children. Because there was no funding inequality between the regions, this contrast is a clear indicator of the differences in quality for the provision of public services. A similar situation existed for the 1974 establishment of family clinics. By 1978, Umbria in the north had a family clinic for every 15,000 residents, whereas Puglia in the south only had a single family clinic for its 3,850,000 total inhabitants. On many other measures, Putnam found that government institutions in the south were performing much less efficiently than those in Italy’s northern and central regions. Putnam’s research indicated that these differences in the performance of government institutions operating within the same formal legal framework could be traced back to variations in the level of civil-society development. The idea is that citizens who have a culture of civic engagement and active participation in various associations will be more involved citizens. They will demand more from their political representatives, including greater attention to the quality of public policy and public services. In other words, civil-society development is a measure of the degree to which citizens are able to overcome their collective-action problems. Cultural attitudes play an important role here, as social norms of solidarity, reciprocity, and trust create an active citizenry. In contrast, if citizens are passive and solely focused on maximizing self-interest, then they will face many collective-action and free-riding problems that corrupt or incompetent politicians can exploit. Putnam measures of civil-society development by looking at participation both in different associations and in elections, newspaper readership, voting for general issues, and patronage voting for candidates who give jobs and favors to their local constituencies. Figure 6 shows, on the left, a map of institutional performance in Italy’s various regions, where the darker colors represent better performance of regional governance and lighter colors represent worse performance, with white being the worst. The right-hand map in Figure 6 shows civic society in Italy, where again darker colors indicate higher levels of civil-society development, and lighter colors lower levels. The correlation between both maps, while imperfect, is nevertheless striking. The performance of regional government is closely related to measures of civil-society development.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts will see, while these farms are, in general, the most efficient means of raising crops and livestock, this does not make them the dominant form of land ownership in developing countries. Worldwide, variations in institutional environments can account for the large differences in the types and patterns of land ownership. Inequality in land ownership is very high in some regions of the world, such as in Latin America, where Spanish colonization has left a deep mark on rural areas: wage labor on large plantations or land rentals to small farmers is prevalent and there is little private ownership of small farms. In other regions, such as East Asia, land is distributed very equally because land reforms have redistributed land from the rich to the poor. Land reform appears to be fundamentally important for the economic development of agriculture in those countries where existing land ownership arrangements result in low productive efficiency, that is, low output per hectare. How do land reforms redistribute arable land from large estates to peasant families? When do such distributions occur? What are the obstacles to such reforms, and what are their economic effects? These are some of the questions we will address in this chapter. Worldwide Land Distribution and Land Contracts What types of land contracts and forms of ownership are the most prevalent in different regions of the world, particularly in developing countries? Table 1 shows some basic facts about inequality in land ownership. These data are not collected very often, so some are old and do not come from comparable years. However, the data are useful because land inequality does not change very much over time. The Gini coefficient is a summary measure of inequality in; Table 1, it represents values between 0 and 100. A higher Gini coefficient means higher inequality of land ownership. Higher inequality of land ownership means that a small number of landowners control large tracts of land, while many small farmers work on modest plots. Table 1 highlights differences among regions of the world in terms of land inequality. Latin America tends to have the highest land Ginis, while Asia has the lowest. These differences in land inequality raise several questions. Can disparities in agricultural technologies explain the variation across countries in the distribution of land ownership? In other words, is high ownership inequality more efficient in Latin America while high ownership equality is more efficient in Asia? If this is the case, what are the technological differences that may explain this? If the variation across countries is not explained by technologies that promote efficiency, then what arrangement is more efficient: a higher or a lower inequality in land ownership? Table 2 displays the distribution of farms and farmland according to ownership and contract status worldwide. Africa, the world’s poorest continent, has the smallest average farm size, at 1.5 hectares. Only 5% of farms are cultivated by their owners. There is, however, also very little tenancy, that is, farmers renting the land they work on from landlords. Nearly 60% of African farmland falls outside the categories of ownership or tenancy. Instead, land is held by means of various forms of communal tenure. In this case, the tribal chief usually has authority to regulate land use by different households and

Culture Culture and Norms of Governance We must consider an important question that relates to the causal links between culture and formal institutions. It is a difficult inquiry, in the style of the “chicken-egg” puzzle: are cultural values the cause of formal institutions, or do formal institutions generate cultural values? This author has argued for a causal effect of culture on formal institutions by classifying them as fast-moving or slow-moving. 8 Political institutions are fast-moving and can change very quickly. In recent history, there have been many rapid transitions from dictatorship to democracy or vice-versa. Political institutions may not change at all for a long time, but the important factor is that they do have the ability to change rapidly. Culture, in contrast, is the best example of a slow-moving institution. Culture changes in a rather continuous way, but very gradually. It never changes as fast as do political institutions. For example, the principal organized religions, which have a significant influence on the cultures of millions of people, have existed for millennia, but have experienced relatively few internal changes over that extended period. This difference between fast- and slow-moving institutions implies that over the long term, culture is more often the driving force for changes in political and legal institutions. Culture is therefore likely to have a causal effect on formal institutions—for example, the culture of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment that led to the structure of our modern legal and political institutions. On the other hand, the exogenous imposition of formal institutions that are in opposition to the local culture will not make these institutions as effective as when they are in sync. This was one of the lessons of Putnam’s work. However, can we empirically prove a causal effect of culture on institutions? Licht, Goldschmidt, and Schwartz have established a causal link between culture and formal institutions, more precisely as measures of good governance. 9 They have developed an original empirical strategy by exploiting a link between language and culture. One of the important variables Schwartz emphasized in his initial work, cited above, is the opposition between embeddedness and autonomy. Embeddedness emphasizes tradition, security, and the traditional order, whereas autonomy emphasizes individual freedom. It turns out that there is a linguistic difference that relates to the opposition between embeddedness and autonomy, that is, whether grammar permits a pronoun to be dropped in a sentence. In English, unlike some other languages, we cannot drop the “I” or “you” as subjects in a sentence. The license to drop the pronoun indicates that the social context is more important than the specific person who speaks. Language and grammar function here as a vehicle for cultural transmission, a fact that linguistics scholars have long emphasized. Licht, Goldschmidt, and Schwartz construct a “pronoun drop” variable, taking a value of 1 if the language allows for a pronoun drop and a 0 otherwise. They find that the pronoun drop variable correlates well with the Schwartz measure of embeddedness and autonomy. 8 Gérard Roland, “Understanding Institutional Change: Fast-Moving and Slow-Moving Institutions,” Studies in Comparative International Development 38, no. 4 (2004): 109-131. 9 Amir N.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts a positive and concave function of L. Assume also that F ( ) = 0, that is, output equals zero if labor equals zero. Assume finally that the cost of labor is simply L itself. This is a simplification, as there are additional cost elements other than labor. Also, the disutility of labor might be a (convex) function of labor effort, but we abstract from that. The individual farmer’s choice of how much labor effort to invest will be the result of the profit maximization with H = F ( L ) L The maximum profit is attained when the derivative of H with respect to L is equal to zero, which gives us F h ( L ) = 1. In other words, the farmer will work the land up to the point where the marginal product of his labor equals 1. This optimal level of effort is L *, shown in Figure 1. In a fixed rental contract with rent R , the tenant will maximize: H R = F ( L ) L R Because R is fixed and does not vary with L, H R is also maximized when F h ( L ) = 1. Figure 1 also shows the solution: the tenant will work just as hard as the individual owner, but his income will be lower. In a typical sharecropping contract, the tenant is allowed to keep a share s (0 6 s 6 1) of output and must give the rest to the landlord. The tenant will thus maximize: sF ( L ) L This objective function is maximized when sF h ( L ) = 1 and will lead to a choice of effort L s that is lower than L*. Figure 2 shows this solution: sharecropping thus reduces the tenant’s incentive relative to ownership and a fixed rental, and the optimum can only be restored if the landlord is ready to pay a share s of the cost of effort. In that case, the tenant maximizes: sF ( L ) sL This expression is maximized if sF h ( L ) = s , which thus gives F h ( L ) = 1, the same condition as in an ownership or fixed rental contract. FIGURE 1 Incentives with Ownership and Fixed Rental Contracts L (Labor) Output, labor costs F ( L ) F ( L ) H R L F ( L ), L H R 0 L * The farmer equates the marginal benefit of his labor to its cost, yielding the optimal amount of labor L*. The optimum is the same with farm ownership or with a rental contract because in the latter case, the incentives at the margin are the same.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts land reform. Instead of asking for radical land redistribution, peasants fought hard for the more modest goal of redistributing the uncultivated land. For decades, Brazil had a “landless worker movement,” the MST (in Portuguese, Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra ). The MST was estimated to be the largest social movement in Latin America, with approximately 1.5 million landless members organized in 23 out of Brazil’s 26 states. Beginning in late 1980 and early 1981, over 6,000 landless families established a squatters’ encampment on a portion of land located between three unproductive estates in Brazil’s southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. With the support of many associations and organizations, including many progressive Catholic clergy, the families eventually pressured the military government into expropriating nearby uncultivated land for the purposes of agrarian reform. 13 In 2005, the MST organized a popular march to demand that left-wing president Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva implement promises to allocate unused land to landless farmers. The large landowners have strongly resisted even these limited reforms and their private militias have routinely gunned down peasant activists fighting for land redistribution. Bolivia adopted an important land reform law after universal suffrage was introduced after the 1952 revolution by the left-wing nationalist revolutionary movement in power. However, due to the weakness of successive governments and the fragility of Bolivia’s democracy, the law’s implementation was very slow. By 1970, only 45% of peasant families had received title to land. When he took office in 2006, the new socialist president, Juan Evo Morales, a member of the Aymara tribe, restarted land reform. In 2006, Bolivia’s senate passed a bill authorizing the government to redistribute land among the nation’s impoverished, and mostly indigenous, peasants. Politicians representing the landlords, however, expressed adamant opposition to the bill. They pledged to reverse the reforms but have, so far, been unsuccessful. In Chile, no significant land reform took place before the 1960s. Under Marxist President Salvador Allende (1970-1973), a radical land reform program was undertaken, and farms of more than 198 acres (80 hectares) were expropriated. However, when General Augusto Pinochet overthrew Allende in a military coup in 1973 with the support of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the process was halted and partially reversed. Because Pinochet represented the interests of the large landholders, expropriated land was either returned to its previous owners or auctioned off to the highest bidder. Guatemala’s recent history has been characterized by intense violence, due in part to issues of land reform. In 1954, a coup orchestrated by the C.I.A., with the support of a coalition of landowners and right-wing paramilitary organizations, overthrew President Jacobo Árbenz after he expropriated large tracts of land exploited by the United Fruit Company to grow bananas. Between the 1970s and the 1990s, the Guatemalan army actively repressed and even massacred Indian peasants while rural guerillas fought for land redistribution. The army destroyed 450 Mayan villages and one million peasants became homeless. The army was accused by international public opinion of orchestrating 13 Gabriel A.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts hands are always needed at harvest time, even in the most advanced economies. But many other farm laborers work all year for a fixed wage. The wage contract is at the other extreme of the fixed rental in terms of both risks and incentives. The worker bears no farm output risk because he receives a fixed wage. Whether the harvest is plentiful or meager, the wage remains the same. It is a fixed payment from the owner to the worker, just as the rent discussed above is a fixed payment from the tenant to the landlord. However, there are no incentives at all to work harder in a fixed-wage contract. Whether the worker sleeps in the field or works hard all day does not make a difference to his wage. Therefore, wage laborers require supervision. If it is effective, supervision forces laborers to work hard during their paid hours, but the more imperfect the supervision, the more serious the incentive problem. Wage labor has, however, one big advantage when combined with effective supervision of labor: there are few limits to the size of the farming operation on the landowner’s property. This means that it is possible to obtain economies of scale through labor specialization; the various harvesting tasks can be separated into efficient operations that certain groups of workers can perform quickly, just as is the case for labor specialization within industry or services. When wage labor is supervised efficiently, it is possible to cultivate much larger tracts of land than those a single farmer could manage on his own or with just his household. The wage-labor system is common on large plantations and other farming operations. Supervision is easier when many laborers work together in defined areas. It requires, however, a large pool of cheap labor. Plantations in the southern United States were operated with slave labor until the 1860s. In Latin America, the Spanish colonizers created the encomienda system, which forced local Indian populations to work for Spanish landlords and subjected them to highly exploitative feudal conditions. Landowners had the power of life and death over their Indian workers. In both the American South and Latin America, plantation owners took advantage of an abundant labor force that was in virtual servitude on the land. When the encomienda system was gradually abolished, already several decades after its establishment, the large haciendas (estates) that replaced it continued to impose quasi-feudal relations on the peasants who worked the land. Let us look more closely at the incentive effects of different types of land contracts: individual ownership, fixed rental contracts, and sharecropping. We abstract from the other aspects discussed, namely the risk aspects as well as the effects on optimal farm size. Assume that farm output Y is a function of total labor input, which includes hours worked as well as the intensity of labor effort. Call this function F ( L ). Assume a diminishing marginal product of labor, so that F’ ( L ) declines as L increases. In other words, assume that F ( L ) is Incentive Effects with Land Ownership, Rental Contracts, and Sharecropping ( Continued )

Market Development but not in all of them. Supply and demand theory teaches that if the initial market situation is one of disequilibrium because prices are not allowed to vary, then reaching equilibrium will lead to a higher level of quantity exchanged on the market. The output fall thus presented a real puzzle in terms of the traditional supply and demand theory. It took quite a while for economists to figure out what had happened. Olivier J. Blanchard and Michael Kremer, as well as Thierry Verdier and this author, found answers that were not based on price theory, but on the theory of contracts and institutions. 5 Under central planning, firms were linked to each other; each firm had designated suppliers and clients, and did not have a choice of either. Price liberalization meant not only that prices could freely move in response to market forces, but also that firms had the freedom to do business with whomever they wanted and, as a consequence, the freedom to stop doing business with the suppliers and clients they were forced to work with under central planning. If a firm breaks off its relations with other firms, it is likely it will do so only if it expects to increase its profits. Blanchard and Kremer made the following argument for how a fall in output trumped established economic theory: If a firm breaks its contract with another firm in hopes of making more profits, it can disrupt the existing production chain. Take the example of car production. Assume that a key supplier of tires breaks its supply contracts in order to sell its products to a foreign firm. In that case, the existing production chain for manufacturing cars breaks down because the supply of tires is no longer available. In principle, with efficient bargaining, the firms in the existing production chain would be willing to contribute to pay the tire producer a higher price for its product in order to discourage it from doing business elsewhere and breaking the supply chain. This should always be the case if the value of the existing production chain is higher than the value of the new production chain with which the supplier wants to work. However, in order to make an offer to the tire producer, the firms need to know how much it will receive from the new foreign customer. Otherwise, the tire producer may be tempted to exaggerate the size of the foreign offer. In a country with weak institutions, the court system will likely be unable to verify that the outside offer received by the tire supplier is real and is not inflated. Without such a verification process, any firm can claim to have higher outside offers than it actually has and thus hold the other members in the production chain hostage. If legal verification is not possible, then the firms in the existing production chain will not be willing to compensate the tire producer for what they might perceive as a fake outside offer. If the offer is real, the production chain will still break down and it will be too late for bargaining and compensation to avert an output fall. Blanchard and Kremer explained the output fall in Central and Eastern Europe as the result of a multitude of breakdowns in bargaining due to weak institutions that lead to a disruption of production chains. To the extent that the loss in output from this disruption was larger than the 5 Olivier Blanchard and Michael Kremer, “Disorganization, The Quarterly Journal of Economics 112, no. 4 (1997): 1091-1126; and Gérard Roland and Thierry Verdier, “Transition and the Output Fall,” Economics of Transition 7, no. 1 (1999): 1-28.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts land to build tourist resorts and factories, and the peasants who sold their ejidos became even more vulnerable economically as a result. In Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, important land reforms introduced after World War II drastically redistributed farmland from the wealthy landlords to small farmers, often the landlords’ former tenants. These reforms were comprehensive and egalitarian in their design. In Japan and South Korea, the U.S. occupation forces implemented the reforms. Traditionally, Japanese tenant farmers had to give roughly half of their rice crop to the landlord. Because the landlords had supported Japan’s military regime during the war, one of the objectives of land reform was to break their traditional power and dismantle the country’s feudal social and political systems, particularly in the countryside. In South Korea, much of the reforms consisted of confiscation of land that had been held before and during World War II by the Japanese occupation government, Japanese companies, and individual Japanese citizens. Wealthy Korean landowners were also obliged to divest most of their land. Because American occupation forces were concerned about a Communist takeover on the Korean peninsula, they decided to take a radical approach and give the land to the peasant farmers in order to prevent the Communists from gaining support in the countryside. As a result, a new class of independent family farmers was created in both Japan and South Korea. Note that in both countries, reforms were the result of a foreign occupation power with a specific interest in making the reforms happen. In Taiwan, land reform was introduced by the Chinese nationalist regime after the end of World War II, with the help of the U.S. government. It was targeted, to a large extent, at lands held by former Japanese owners who had fled Taiwan after Japan’s defeat. Taiwanese landowners whose properties were expropriated were compensated through the sale of properties seized from the Japanese. While other countries in East Asia, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, did not undergo radical land reform as in Japan, South Korea or Taiwan, important land reforms did take place in India after decolonization. The 1949 Indian constitution stipulated that Indian states had the power to institute land reforms. Four types of reforms took place in the decades following independence. The first type was tenancy reforms, which were aimed at securing the rights of tenant sharecroppers and making their eviction more difficult. Provided the tenant paid his share of the harvest to the landlord (which could not exceed 25% of the crop) and did not leave the land fallow, his rights to work the land were secure. In some cases, tenancy reforms even involved attempts to transfer ownership rights to tenants. The second type of reform aimed at abolishing the intermediaries, the zamindari , who collected tax revenues for the British and extracted large rents from tenants. The third type of reform provided limits on the amount of land an individual could own with a view toward redistributing it from the wealthy to the landless. The fourth type of reform consolidated disparate landholdings by organizing an exchange or trade of land so that individual owners could work on contiguous plots. Consolidation laws were implemented vigorously in some states but halfheartedly elsewhere. Later in this chapter, we will discuss the effects of these four types of land reform. In South Africa, starting in 1994, the government bought large landholdings from white owners and redistributed it to poor black farmers. The objective

Rural Land Rights and Contracts communist ideology was the motivating force behind these revolutions, the Russian Bolshevik Party and the Chinese Communist Party soon nationalized the land and organized agriculture into collective farms under centralized government control. Stalin instituted land collectivization in 1929 through a brutal process in which harvests were confiscated from the peasants, who were forced to work under police supervision to provide grain to Russian cities. Millions of Ukrainian peasants died from starvation during this process. In China, a collectivization process was launched in 1955 that organized farmers into communes. Incentives were virtually nonexistent under collectivized farming because the peasants worked as wage laborers and, as a result, land productivity plummeted. The Chinese commune system lasted until the agricultural reforms of 1978 under Deng Xiaoping. In Africa, countries such as Ghana under Kwame Nkrumah, Guinea under Ahmed Sékou Touré, and Tanzania under Julius Nyerere, introduced land reforms aimed at collectivizing farms. In Tanzania, these were called the ujamaa villages. However, the conditions in Africa that preceded these efforts were vastly different from those in Russia or China before the introduction of collective farming. The attempts to transition from Africa’s traditional communal subsistence farming to more modern collectivist farming failed. No incentives were put in place to increase productivity, and forced collectivization violated local communal traditions. Land reform was one of the primary motivating factors of the Mexican Revolution, which lasted from 1910 to 1921. A radical program was launched under the presidency of Alvaro Obregon to confiscate the landholdings of large domestic and foreign landowners, and redistribute it to peasants. Politically, this was possible because the landlords who owned the large estates, or haciendas , lost their hold on power during the revolution. Interestingly, many peasants saw the reforms as an end to the rule of the Spanish colonial landlords and a return to the communal land ownership of the ejido system that had existed during the Aztec Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries. Under this system, peasants collectively owned an ejido, an area of communal farmland that they could work but could not sell. The revolution nationalized the land and gave it to the peasants to work and a state-owned bank provided them with credit. Initially, the implementation of land reforms was slow; by 1928, less than 10% of landholdings had been redistributed as ejidos. However, between 1934 and 1940, President Lázaro Cárdenas accelerated land reforms and redistributed close to half of the land in the form of ejidos. Further reforms were undertaken in the 1970s under President Luis Echeverria, when large foreign-owned plantations were turned into ejidos. The typical size of the ejido was usually too small, however, to be profitable using modern farming technology. Moreover, because farmers could not resell the land, there could be no market for the ejidos and they could not be used as collateral, so credit was not available to farmers. Under President Carlos Salinas (1988-1994), sale of ejido land, as well as its use as collateral, was finally permitted. One of the reasons for this reform was NAFTA (the North American Free Trade agreement), signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 1994. After it became law, U.S. corporations wanted to buy land in Mexico to set up manufacturing facilities. Wealthy Mexicans bought up ejid o

Market Development output gain from the formation of new business partnerships, there was an output fall in the economy as a whole. Verdier and this author’s argument is slightly different. They also view price liberalization as an opportunity to break existing production partnerships and form new ones. However, the output fall is due to a combination of two factors: search frictions and investment specificity . After price liberalization, existing firms search for new profitable partners, but in the absence of pre-existing markets, this search takes time. This is what we mean by search frictions. Also, while firms are searching for new partners, they will not invest with existing partners. The idea is that investments are specific to a given production relationship. This is what is meant by investment specificity. If a firm expects to discontinue its current relationship with existing partners, it will not invest in it. It will only invest once it has found a new long-term partner. The combination of search frictions and investment specificity will lead to an output fall because of two factors: first, there will be little investment while the economy-wide search takes place and this will depress output. Second, once a firm has found another partner, there is, as Blanchard and Kremer’s argument describes, a disruption of the existing production chain. The output fall in Central and Eastern Europe forced economists to take a fresh look at how markets emerge. It is not just a story of supply and demand, forces that work well when markets preexist, that is, when search frictions are not too significant and when there are strong formal institutions to enforce contracts and help resolve business conflicts. Supply and demand are thus only one part of the story. But analyzing markets only through the lens of supply and demand can result in misleading conclusions. China and the Dual-Track System Contrary to what economists observed in Central and Eastern Europe, there was no output fall in China when prices there were liberalized. The primary explanation for this is related to the specific method of price liberalization used in China, called dual-track liberalization . Under dual-track liberalization, only part of a firm’s output is liberalized: one part is produced on the plan track , following plan orders of output, planned supplies and deliveries set in previous years, while all extra production is sold freely at free market prices on the market track . Figure 2 illustrates what dual-track liberalization does, in contrast to normal liberalization. We first use a simple supply and demand diagram because, despite its limitations described above, it easily explains the dual-track method. However, further on, when discussing why there was no output fall in China, we will depart from the supply and demand framework. Consider a situation in which prices are not liberalized. Assume that the price is at P P , below the equilibrium market price P E . The quantity being sold is Q P . With normal price liberalization, the quantity will be Q E at price P E . Note that this quantity is higher than Q P . Then, consider the case of dual-track price liberalization in which there is a plan track that corresponds to existing plan contracts and obligations. Firms are, however, told that once they have fulfilled their plan obligations, they can then contract freely. In other words, quantity Q P must still be delivered at price P P , but beyond Q P prices are allowed to freely move in response to supply and demand forces. Note then that the equilibrium

Rural Land Rights and Contracts a negative effect on state agricultural income, while land consolidation legislation had a positive effect. The other two types of reforms had no effects. Land consolidation thus did not affect poverty, but it positively affected output. In other words, it had positive efficiency effects but no significant redistributive effect, which suggests that the richest peasants probably were able to use land consolidation laws to their advantage by buying land adjacent to their properties and selling land further away from their main holdings. As for tenancy reform, it had an important effect on poverty reduction but a negative effect on output. One interpretation of these results is that tenancy reform increased the bargaining power of tenants, which reduced poverty because they could negotiate better tenancy contracts, but the same reform also made it more difficult to evict less productive tenants and tenants who shirked, i.e., did not work much. This latter effect negatively impacted output. Effect of long-term tenure. In another study, Abhijit Banerjee, Paul Gertler, and Maitreesh Ghatak found evidence for a positive output effect of tenancy reform in West Bengal. 15 Their argument was that even though protection from eviction can lead to more shirking, there is another effect that is related to tenants’ stronger bargaining power: When tenants had more power to negotiate terms, the landlord gave them a more favorable contract that granted them a higher share of output. This created incentives to work harder and it offset the negative effects of improved security. The researchers based their evidence on West Bengal, where, in 1977, a new government passed a reform act that made it harder for landlords to evict tenants. The government also launched Operation Barga, a well-publicized campaign in villages to inform tenants of their rights and to encourage them to register as tenants so that their rights could also be registered. This operation was a success and by 1993, more than 65% of sharecropper tenants in West Bengal had registered. To assess the effect of the reforms, the researchers compared the records of rice yields in West Bengal to those in neighboring Bangladesh, where no reforms took place. Rice is the main agricultural product on both sides of the border, covering more than 70% of agricultural land. Before Operation Barga, rice yields were not noticeably different in West Bengal and Bangladesh. However, after the program’s introduction (1984-1993), rice yields were significantly higher in West Bengal by 5 to 18%, leading to a possible increase of yields on sharecropped land of about 42%. The researchers also tried to estimate the effect of the reforms by using another empirical strategy: the registration rate of sharecroppers per district as a measure of the success of Operation Barga. They then regressed rice yields on sharecropper registration with a 1-year lag, controlling for district and for year effects. The success of the reform is thus the effect of a change in registration on rice yields multiplied by the change in the registration rate. At 60%, this strategy provided even higher estimates of the increase in rice yields. Overall, the existing evidence shows that land reform has clear positive effects in terms of reducing poverty. The studies also show that reforms to 15 Abhijit V. Banerjee, Paul J.

However, after the program’s introduction (1984-1993), rice yields were significantly higher in West Bengal by 5 to 18%, leading to a possible increase of yields on sharecropped land of about 42%. The researchers also tried to estimate the effect of the reforms by using another empirical strategy: the registration rate of sharecroppers per district as a measure of the success of Operation Barga. They then regressed rice yields on sharecropper registration with a 1-year lag, controlling for district and for year effects. The success of the reform is thus the effect of a change in registration on rice yields multiplied by the change in the registration rate. At 60%, this strategy provided even higher estimates of the increase in rice yields. Overall, the existing evidence shows that land reform has clear positive effects in terms of reducing poverty. The studies also show that reforms to 15 Abhijit V. Banerjee, Paul J.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development nations are poor and do not have property. Even if they are fortunate enough to own a house or small parcel of land, they often cannot use it as acceptable collateral because of the absence of property titling systems. When borrowers do not have collateral, creditors sometimes agree to lend if they can closely monitor the use of the loan, but because monitoring is costly, creditors then charge high interest rates for the loans. This makes repayment more difficult and often leads to situations similar to the farmer suicides in India. Given the difficulties of accessing credit in developing countries, special institutions have evolved to provide credit to the poor. A particular institutional innovation is that of microcredit , small loans made available to poor households and villages. Microcredit does not require collateral, but instead uses peer pressure from the local community to enforce loan repayment. This saves on the costs of monitoring the loan and provides the poor with cheap access to credit. The founder of one of the most successful microcredit firms, Muhammad Yunus of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to make credit available to his country’s poor. Microcredit, as developed in Bangladesh, is only one of the forms of microfinance available in developing countries. In this chapter, we discuss the development of different forms of microfinance and how these various types of credit contribute to alleviating the problems of informational asymmetry and commitment. As we will see, microfinance also has its problems and banks providing microcredit have had a hard time achieving financial sustainability. The Demand for Credit in Developing Economies What are the main sources of demand for credit in developing economies? In countries where agriculture is the main source of economic activity, credit is important because of the time lag between purchasing inputs and receiving revenues from harvested crops. Farmers need to buy seeds, fertilizers, equipment, and other supplies up to a year before they receive revenues from their crops. More affluent farmers may not need credit if they can use their savings to purchase agricultural inputs in advance, but poor farmers rarely have enough savings. In nonagricultural sectors, most enterprises incur both fixed and variable costs from the first day of operations until revenues are received at some future date. Entrepreneurs need credit for fixed capital expenditures such as manufacturing equipment, trucks, and computers, and they also need credit for working capital to cover rental payments, utility bills, wages, and the purchase of various supplies and materials. Demand for credit is related not only to production expenses, but also to various household expenditures. Credit is needed for children’s educational expenses and for various consumer items. In many countries, households spend a large amount of money, often a multiple of their annual income, for weddings and even, at times, for funerals. With economic development, the demand for consumer credit increases as households purchase electronics such as radios, televisions, cell phones, and home computers. Demand for credit may also be related to the various unexpected economic shocks that households can experience. These are income disruptions such as

Market Development firms typically use only one supplier for a specific input and have a continuing business relationship with that supplier even when the firms can choose among many different suppliers. How is information about the reputation of particular businesspeople circulated in emerging nations? Typically, because businesspeople try to economize on the costs of information gathering and transmission, personal recommendations play a very important role in business relationships. Rather than trying to gather information about individuals’ past business dealings, their honesty, reliability, etc., African businesspeople generally will only deal with someone if that person has been recommended by other businesspeople they trust, and they will typically do little business outside the market networks to which they belong. In some emerging nations, ethnic and religious affiliations play an important role in terms of creating communities of people who trust each other sufficiently enough to do business together. This results in parallel business networks with ethnic or religious affiliations. For example, Jean Ensminger showed that being a Muslim helped an individual enter numerous Islamic-dominant business networks in Kenya and other East African nations. Muslim businesspeople were more likely to trust others of their faith and, as a result, many people converted to Islam in order to be able to participate in these predominantly Muslim business networks. 3 James E. Rauch and Vitor Trindade showed that Chinese ethnic communities in Asian nations played a crucial role in facilitating international trade between countries. 4 Chinese businesspeople formed trade associations that provided information about distributors and suppliers to producers. These associations also helped to match buyers and sellers, and they provided referral services and information on the reputation of particular businesspeople. However, there is, generally, significant diversity in the nature and composition of business networks in emerging nations. In Ghana for example, there is no strong ethnic or religious homogeneity in the business networks that have formed. In contrast, the manufacturing sector in Kenya is dominated by entrepreneurs from India and other South Asian nations; as a result, it is very difficult for entrepreneurs from other groups to enter business networks in that sector. In Zimbabwe, while manufacturing has been controlled by Europeans and Asians, small businesses are overwhelmingly controlled by native Zimbabweans. There is a historical legacy at play; Zimbabwe was formerly Rhodesia, an unrecognized state in the United Kingdom controlled by British settlers. However, even after white rule ended in 1980, networks of white businesspeople have continued to dominate Zimbabwe’s large firms, leaving firms of smaller size to non-white groups. The Emergence of Markets in Transition Countries An example of emerging markets is the experience of the transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe and in Asia during the period when market economies replaced central planning. Because there were no markets under 3 Jean Ensminger, Making a Market (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992). 4 James E.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development a job loss, the death of the household’s wage earner, or a fall in crop prices. There can also be expense shocks in the form of a sudden health problem or paying for damages that are the result of a natural disaster such as a flood, hurricane, or earthquake. Households generally cannot buy insurance coverage for protection against these risks, so they must borrow the money necessary to weather these adverse events. The Theory of Credit Markets in Development In order to understand problems with credit markets, we need to focus on the transaction costs associated with credit. These costs are related to informational and commitment problems. We will examine informational problems in this section and discuss commitment issues in the next section. We also discuss why these problems tend to be more acute in developing countries compared to developed countries. Adverse selection and moral hazard are pervasive in credit markets because of informational asymmetries. Banks do not know the quality of borrowers, nor do they know what choices borrowers may make and how those choices will affect the likelihood of loan repayment. Financing an Entrepreneur in Mumbai To help us more clearly understand credit problems that arise from informational asymmetries, let us start with a numerical example. Assume two investment projects, one safe and the other risky, both requiring an investment of 100. Take the example of an Indian tailor in a big city such as Mumbai. With the safe project, the tailor would purchase sewing equipment to start a tailoring workshop. With the risky project, the tailor would purchase a car to start a taxi business. Obviously, both projects involve some risk. We assume, however, that the tailor is quite knowledgeable about supply and demand conditions in the tailoring business, but is relatively ignorant about these factors in the taxi business. He is curious about the taxi business because he has heard stories of people from his native region who have become quite successful as taxi drivers. The safe project, in this case the tailoring shop, is assumed to yield a return of 150 with probability 1. Not only is there a high return (50%), but there is also no risk: the return is always the same, under any circumstances. However, the risky project, purchasing a car, yields a return of 280 with 50% probability and a return of 0 with 50% probability. 1 Because we will use this example extensively in this chapter, we represent it in Table 1. Which project should the tailor choose? Let us assume that the tailor is risk neutral ; that is, he bases his decision only on the expected return without taking the risk into account. The safe project has an expected return of 150 and the risky project has an expected return of 0.5 * 280 + 0.5 * 0 = 140. Indeed, the expected return is equal to the return in the good state (280) times its 1 These numbers are somewhat extreme, but they make things simpler.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts slaves were ordered to pick lines of plants and overseers could determine who moved the fastest and the slowest. They could also check to see whether the picking had been thorough. The fastest and most productive slaves were rewarded and this generated a kind of yardstick competition, that is, a rivalry to perform better than other slaves in the same row, which had the effect of achieving a very fast hourly production rate. Fogel and Engerman’s productivity figures have been subject to many controversies and debates. On the basis of the theory of division of labor discussed above, we could argue that economies of scale may give a productive edge to plantations, especially if labor practices include monitoring. However, plantations were mostly based on slave labor or quasi-slave labor. Although owning slaves had a cost, it was lower than that of labor by freemen. When slavery was abolished in the South and in other countries such as Brazil or the Caribbean nations, the organization of agriculture changed. In the southern United States, former slaves usually did not become wage laborers but instead became sharecroppers on small plots owned by large landholders. Large plantations were, however, maintained in many South American countries in conditions such that if the indigenous populations were not actually enslaved, at best they faced quasi-feudal conditions in which they had no other options than to work on the plantations. This suggests that the economies of scale on large plantations were only possible because the labor used on the land was virtually, if not literally, enslaved. If plantations had been run more efficiently using the labor of freemen, land owners would have been happy to pay the former slaves a wage that was higher than the income they would have received as sharecroppers or small farmers. All parties would then have benefited from the greater efficiency of plantations. As this was not the case, we have good reason to doubt the efficiency of large plantations in the absence of slave labor. Plantations and Privately Owned Family Farms In general, evidence suggests that large plantations are less productive than small family farms. Measuring farm productivity is not easy as there are different production factors to consider (land, capital, and labor). Due to issues of data availability, studies usually focus only on land productivity, which measures output per hectare of land. A classic study is that by Robert Berry and William Cline, who collected a large amount of data on farm size and productivity, and documented an inverse relationship between the two. 8 Table 4 shows that smaller farms are always more productive than are the largest farms, whether they are in Brazil, Pakistan, or Malaysia. The productivity difference is the strongest in Brazil (more than 5 times, or a 400% difference!), where the size differential is the largest. The difference is least in Malaysia (48% larger), where the size differential is the smallest. Other studies have reached similar conclusions. 9 8 Robert A. Berry and William R. Cline, Agrarian Structure and Productivity in Developing Countries: A Study Prepared for the International Labour Office within the Framework of the World Employment Programme (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979). 9 See, for example, Alain de Janvry, The Agrarian Question and Reformism in Latin America (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981).

Rural Land Rights and Contracts was to have black farmers run 30% of commercial farmland by 2014, but only a third of the objective had been met by 2012. Zimbabwe at first implemented a program similar to South Africa’s; initially, only voluntary transactions were envisioned, but in 1998, the Zimbabwean government launched an expropriation program, taking land from white farmers and redistributing it to veterans of the country’s Liberation War. In 2000, a constitutional referendum to give the government the right to expropriate land without compensation was defeated, but armed bands of veterans subsequently seized white-owned farmland. While agricultural output used to be quite impressive in Zimbabwe, it has fallen dramatically as a consequence of the reforms. Despite the dismal results of Zimbabwe’s land expropriation, pressure has also been building in South Africa to implement a program that would expropriate white-owned farmland. In 2012, the African National Congress Youth League for example called for land expropriation without compensation, but no actions were taken so far. The history of land reforms in the 20th century reveals that as a rule, they were not the result of a benevolent government’s decision to increase agricultural efficiency. Land reforms usually took place in the aftermath of political turmoil such as a revolution, a foreign occupation, or decolonization. These turbulent events usually represented shifts in political power and land reforms generally reflected the interests of whatever party was currently in power. The Mexican revolution ended the domination of the large hacienda owners as did the Russian and the Chinese revolutions. The U.S. occupation of Japan and Korea deposed the militarists who had been supported by the large landlords. In the case of decolonization, the lands of former colonizers were confiscated and redistributed. Shifts in political power lead to shifts in property distribution. In the case of Russia and China as well as many former colonies, ideology also played a role in land reform. In those cases, newly powerful ideologues tried to exert direct control over farmers in accordance with a partisan blueprint. Obstacles to Land Reform Not surprisingly, in countries where there were no revolutions or large shifts in power, obstacles to land reform have been quite formidable. Binswanger, Deininger, and Feder argued that land reform met the most obstacles in countries where land ownership was very concentrated in the large haciendas. For the most part, laborers rather than tenants worked the land in those countries, and large landowners fiercely resisted reforms. 12 Compared to other continents, Latin America had the least favorable conditions for land reform. In Brazil, 1. % of the landowners controlled roughly half (46. %) of the land on which crops could be grown. Only 3% of the population owned two-thirds of all arable land. Much of the large landowners’ holdings were left uncultivated and unproductive. Nevertheless, these landowners, who had always held great political power and influence, vigorously opposed any attempt at 12 Binswanger, Deininger, and Feder, “Agricultural Land Relations in the Developing World,” 1993.

Market Development transportation costs to the village and back to the market, whether or not they succeed in contracting with the farmer. Consider the minimum price at which the farmer makes no profit under the traditional as well as the new technology. What are the conditions of transportation costs for which profits are positive for a monopsonist but negative if there are two or more traders? 3. In this exercise, we analyze the dual-track system of price liberalization that was implemented in China. Assume a market in which supply and demand follow, respectively, the following equations: P = 2 + 4 Q , P = 14 2 Q . What are the equilibrium price and quantity? Assume that a quantity of 1 must be delivered at the planned price of 5 on the plan track. Draw the supply and demand curve. Basing your computations on Figure 2, draw the consumer surplus under the plan track (assuming that those with the greatest willingness to pay are served first), and then draw the consumer and producer surplus under price liberalization, where the equilibrium quantity is traded at the equilibrium price. How will total consumer plus producer surpluses under the dual-track system compare with total surplus under full-price liberalization, that is, the standard market equilibrium? 4.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts genocide against Guatemala’s indigenous peoples. In 1992, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Rigoberta Menchú for her efforts to bring international attention to the government-sponsored genocide of the indigenous population. In 1996, a peace accord was signed between the guerillas and the government. Land reform is still a contentious policy issue in Guatemala where less than 1% of landowners hold 75% of the best agricultural land. In Venezuela, after Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999, a program called Plan Zamora (named for Eziquiel Zamora, a 19th-century peasant leader) was adopted in 2001 to redistribute government land and unused private land to poor peasants. Conservative forces strongly opposed the reforms and when they staged a coup against Chavez in 2002, they soon cancelled the program. However, the coup ultimately failed, Chavez came back to power, and since then thousands of peasant households have received land titles as a result of Plan Zamora. However, significant opposition to the plan has occurred in the countryside, where large landlords are still politically powerful. The Chavez government has had little influence in many rural areas and, since 2001, a number of activist leaders have been assassinated. Effects of Land Reform What effects does land reform have on poverty or on land productivity? In order to answer this question, we must look at the experience of specific countries and compare land productivity and other economic variables before and after the institution of reforms. Unfortunately, land reforms are rare events and studies of their effects are scarce. The sections that follow describe some recent studies. Effects on poverty and growth. Timothy Besley and Robin Burgess examined the effect of land reforms in India. 14 Their data covered reforms from the following Indian states: Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The researchers counted the number of reforms in the four main categories of Indian land reform mentioned earlier in this chapter: 1) making eviction of tenants more difficult; 2) abolishing the zamindari intermediary system; 3) placing limits on total landholdings; and 4) consolidating disparate landholdings. Using a count of reforms is not precise because some laws may be more important than others, but it is not easy to develop better alternative measures. Besley and Burgess found that tenancy reform and abolition of the intermediary system reduced poverty, but that the two other reforms (ceilings on landholdings and land consolidation) did not. This suggests that the latter reforms were ineffective. Most rich landowners were able to circumvent the laws on limits to landholdings by distributing land to immediate family members, cousins, and friends. Consolidation laws were implemented halfheartedly in many states where the political influence of wealthy landlords was strong. Besley and Burgess also found that land reforms positively affected the wages of agricultural workers. They also determined that tenancy reform had 14 Timothy Besley and Robin Burgess, “Land Reform, Poverty Reduction, and Growth: Evidence from India,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 115, no. 2 (2000): 389-430.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts control during British rule. The data cover the period from 1956 to 1987. The researchers found that in nonlandlord districts, on average 6. % of additional land was subject to irrigation. Given that roughly 28% of land was irrigated, that represents an improvement of 24% over the average proportion of land irrigated. They also found that in nonlandlord districts there was greater use of fertilizer and of high yield-varieties of rice, wheat, and other cereal grains, which resulted in higher yields in those districts. How can we explain this persistence of historical differences in institutional arrangements? Banerjee and Iyer argue that the best explanation is the difference between the political environments found in former landlord versus nonlandlord districts. One important difference is the provision of public services. Since the 1960s, former landlord districts have spent nearly 50% less on rural development per capita than the former nonlandlord districts. This period also has seen significant technological change in agriculture in the nonlandlord districts. Nonlandlord districts also invested more in health and education, achieving higher literacy rates and lower infant mortality rates. These differences in public expenditures can arguably be attributed to an atmosphere of class conflict and class resentment in the former landlord districts. Chapter Summary Worldwide Land Distribution and Land Contracts Land is distributed equally in Asia and very unequally in Latin America. While small private farming is predominant in Asia, communal farming on small plots is the predominant type of land distribution in Africa. Latin America typically has large plantations, while in South Asia, sharecropping predominates. Properties of Land Contracts Individual privately owned farms are more efficient because they provide optimal incentives for effort and investment, but farmers bear all the risks. Farm size depends on the availability of technology. Economic Effects of Land Contracts Empirical studies confirm the theoretical predictions for the effects of different land arrangements. Patterns of land ownership and farm size are explained less convincingly by efficiency measures than by historical and institutional legacies. Land Reform Land reform is the redistribution to small farmers of large tracts of land owned by landlords. Land reform most often occurred after important shifts in political power such as revolutions, foreign occupations, or decolonization. Large and politically powerful landowners resisted both radical land reform and more modest reforms such as the redistribution of idle land to landless peasants. Land reform has had positive effects in terms of both poverty reduction and output. In India, reforms that provide more security to tenants have had both positive and negative effects on productivity.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts improve the security of tenants may have either positive or negative effects on output. However, on the basis of the theoretical discussion earlier in this chapter, we have good reasons to believe that more radical reforms giving full ownership rights to tenants would have positive effects on output. Persistence of past institutional arrangements. If individually owned farms are more efficient than sharecropping contracts, do differences in efficiency related to differences in institutional arrangements persist over time after land reforms, possibly decades old, have changed the property right arrangements? Ahbijit Banerjee and Lakshmi Iyer found that this was the case in India. 16 When the British colonized India, they instituted two different systems for collecting land revenue. In certain regions such as Bengal and Bihar, land revenue collection was assigned to landlords, the zamindari. During the Mughal Empire, these landlords had been state officials, but over time, they became the de facto owners of large tracts of land. In this landlord-based system, a zamindar was responsible for collecting revenue from the peasants under his jurisdiction. These revenue-collecting rights could be bequeathed to heirs and could also be bought and sold. Sharecropping was quite widespread in the zamindari areas. On the other hand, in regions such as Gujarat, Karnataka, or Andhra Pradesh, land revenue was collected by the British rulers directly from the individual farmers; the British did not encourage a landlord-based system. Early on, these areas also developed a detailed system of titling and land records through a cadastral system that recorded a parcel’s owner, its size, and its value for the purpose of computing land taxes. The land revenue system has historic roots. In the early period of British rule, the landlord system was favored because it required less British administration. Areas colonized after 1820 were more likely to have the direct revenue collection system partly because individual administrators such as Sir Thomas Munro, governor of Madras, or Lord Elphinstone, governor of Bombay, favored the private ownership system. James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill, wrote extensively on British administration in India; he also favored private ownership over landlord-based systems and was quite influential in the East India Company, England’s monopolistic trading company in South Asia. Landlord-based systems were responsible for great inequality in land distribution and wealth, while private ownership systems had a more egalitarian distribution. This distinction between these two systems ceased after Indian independence in 1947. Since then, there have been many land redistribution reforms, but intriguingly, this early institutional difference has had long-run consequences. To document this persistence of past institutional arrangements Banerjee and Iyer regressed variables that measure agricultural investments (irrigation, fertilizer, and high-yield grain varieties) and agricultural productivity on a variety of geographical controls. These controls include altitude, latitude, mean annual rainfall, soil type, coastal versus inland regions, and the proportion of villages, estates, or other tracts of land in a district that was not under landlord 16 Abhijit Banerjee and Lakshmi Iyer, “History, Institutions, and Economic Performance: The Legacy of Colonial Land Tenure Systems in India,” The American Economic Review 95, no. 4 (2005): 1190-1213.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts Definitions Ejido Land system in Mexico that originated during the Aztec Empire, in which peasants collectively owned an area of communal farmland that they could work but could not sell. Encomienda Legal system established by the Spanish conquistadores in Latin America that forced local Indian populations to work for specific Spanish landlords and subjected them to highly exploitative conditions often amounting to slavery. Fallowing Leaving a field idle during a growing season to let the soil retain nutrients and moisture for future crops. Fixed wage Wage paid by the hour, independent of the work actually performed. Hacienda Large land estate in Spanish-speaking countries, primarily in Latin America. Land reform Redistribution of land from large landholders to small farmers. Monsoon Seasonal reversal of winds accompanied by significant changes in precipitation characterized by heavy rains. Term used mostly in India and neighboring countries of South Asia. Residual return The return that is left from an investment after all the costs, including labor costs and rental costs of capital, have been paid. Zamindari Intermediaries in India under British colonial rule who collected tax revenues for the British and extracted large rents from tenants for their own enrichment. 


Market Development Definitions Dual-track liberalization Method of price liberalization used in China in the 1980s. Under dual-track liberalization, only part of a firm’s output is liberalized, while the other part remains under the control of the central planning system. Entitlement set All the goods an individual can obtain with the resources he or she commands, given the laws of his or her society. Investment specificity Investments that are specific to a given production relationship and do not have value, or have little value, outside that relationship. Market integration Markets are integrated when the same good is sold at the same price in different markets. If transport costs are sufficiently high, markets are integrated if prices on different markets move in the same way at the same time. Market track In the context of dual-track price liberalization, the firm’s output above the plan track is sold freely at market prices. Monopsonies Single buyers on a market, in contrast to monopolies that are single sellers. Plan track In the context of dual-track price liberalization, part of a firm’s output is still produced and allocated within the central planning system. Search frictions Situation in which buyers and sellers on markets, or investors and entrepreneurs in need of finance, do not find each other immediately and must incur search costs before finding the right partner.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts slaves were ordered to pick lines of plants and overseers could determine who moved the fastest and the slowest. They could also check to see whether the picking had been thorough. The fastest and most productive slaves were rewarded and this generated a kind of yardstick competition, that is, a rivalry to perform better than other slaves in the same row, which had the effect of achieving a very fast hourly production rate. Fogel and Engerman’s productivity figures have been subject to many controversies and debates. On the basis of the theory of division of labor discussed above, we could argue that economies of scale may give a productive edge to plantations, especially if labor practices include monitoring. However, plantations were mostly based on slave labor or quasi-slave labor. Although owning slaves had a cost, it was lower than that of labor by freemen. When slavery was abolished in the South and in other countries such as Brazil or the Caribbean nations, the organization of agriculture changed. In the southern United States, former slaves usually did not become wage laborers but instead became sharecroppers on small plots owned by large landholders. Large plantations were, however, maintained in many South American countries in conditions such that if the indigenous populations were not actually enslaved, at best they faced quasi-feudal conditions in which they had no other options than to work on the plantations. This suggests that the economies of scale on large plantations were only possible because the labor used on the land was virtually, if not literally, enslaved. If plantations had been run more efficiently using the labor of freemen, land owners would have been happy to pay the former slaves a wage that was higher than the income they would have received as sharecroppers or small farmers. All parties would then have benefited from the greater efficiency of plantations. As this was not the case, we have good reason to doubt the efficiency of large plantations in the absence of slave labor. Plantations and Privately Owned Family Farms In general, evidence suggests that large plantations are less productive than small family farms. Measuring farm productivity is not easy as there are different production factors to consider (land, capital, and labor). Due to issues of data availability, studies usually focus only on land productivity, which measures output per hectare of land. A classic study is that by Robert Berry and William Cline, who collected a large amount of data on farm size and productivity, and documented an inverse relationship between the two. 8 Table 4 shows that smaller farms are always more productive than are the largest farms, whether they are in Brazil, Pakistan, or Malaysia. The productivity difference is the strongest in Brazil (more than 5 times, or a 400% difference!), where the size differential is the largest. The difference is least in Malaysia (48% larger), where the size differential is the smallest. Other studies have reached similar conclusions. 9 8 Robert A. Berry and William R.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts Sharecropping In a sharecropping contract, the tenant gives the landlord a certain portion of the crop. If the crop is good, the landlord receives more. If it is bad, he receives less. Sharecropping is a form of rental contract that amounts to paying a lower rent in bad times and a higher rent in good times. Consider our numerical example. Suppose that by contract the landlord receives 50% of the crop. On average, he will receive 50 from the tenant. However, in good times, he will receive 62. , and in bad times he will receive 37. . Compared to a fixed rental contract, the landlord shares part of the risk. As a consequence, compared to a pure rental contract, the tenant will face less risk. In good times, his income will be 62.5 (half of 125) instead of 75. In bad times, it will be 37.5 (half of 75) instead of 25. Because average income still is 50, the risk now represents 25% of the tenant’s income. As a result, sharecropping reduces the farmer’s income volatility as compared to a fixed rental contract. Note also that the farmer can never be insolvent relative to the landlord because he delivers a given proportion of the crop. Sharecropping thus eliminates the risk of eviction that exists with rental contracts and it reduces the overall risks a tenant faces compared to a fixed rental contract. However, sharecropping also has its disadvantages. The principal drawback is that incentives are weaker than they would be with ownership or a fixed rental contract. Now the tenant is only a residual claimant to a share of the crop, not to all of it. Why is this bad for incentives? When deciding how much effort to put into raising a crop, the tenant equates the marginal benefit to the marginal cost of his labor. When the sharecropper considers whether or not to work one hour more, he understands that he must share the marginal benefit from that hour of work. Because labor costs time and effort, and because the marginal benefit of labor is decreasing, the sharecropper will prefer to work less so as to equate his marginal cost of effort with his share of his labor’s marginal benefit. The farmer-owner, however, is ready to work longer hours because when he contemplates the benefit of an additional costly hour, he instead gets the whole marginal benefit. Sharecropping thus dilutes the incentives to invest effort into the farming operation. Sharecropping contracts reduce the risk for a tenant but they also reduce the incentives for effort. The distortionary effects of sharecropping can be partially offset if the landlord tells the tenant that he will compensate him for a portion of his labor. In that way, the landlord shares not only the benefits but also the costs. Now the tenant will equate his share of the marginal benefit with his share of the marginal cost. If these shares are equal, then the incentives will be equivalent to those present with ownership or a fixed rental. It is easy to share the costs of inputs such as fertilizers that are easily observed. However, effort exerted in a farming operation is typically not observed, which results in asymmetric information. In that case, there is no easy way to share the cost of effort. The sharecropper’s incentive will thus still be lower than with ownership or a fixed rental. Labor Contracts Not all farmers are owners or tenants. Many agricultural workers are laborers who work for a wage. For now, we will discuss the case of a fixed wage , that is, a wage paid by the hour. Many wage laborers are seasonal workers, as extra

Rural Land Rights and Contracts was to have black farmers run 30% of commercial farmland by 2014, but only a third of the objective had been met by 2012. Zimbabwe at first implemented a program similar to South Africa’s; initially, only voluntary transactions were envisioned, but in 1998, the Zimbabwean government launched an expropriation program, taking land from white farmers and redistributing it to veterans of the country’s Liberation War. In 2000, a constitutional referendum to give the government the right to expropriate land without compensation was defeated, but armed bands of veterans subsequently seized white-owned farmland. While agricultural output used to be quite impressive in Zimbabwe, it has fallen dramatically as a consequence of the reforms. Despite the dismal results of Zimbabwe’s land expropriation, pressure has also been building in South Africa to implement a program that would expropriate white-owned farmland. In 2012, the African National Congress Youth League for example called for land expropriation without compensation, but no actions were taken so far. The history of land reforms in the 20th century reveals that as a rule, they were not the result of a benevolent government’s decision to increase agricultural efficiency. Land reforms usually took place in the aftermath of political turmoil such as a revolution, a foreign occupation, or decolonization. These turbulent events usually represented shifts in political power and land reforms generally reflected the interests of whatever party was currently in power. The Mexican revolution ended the domination of the large hacienda owners as did the Russian and the Chinese revolutions. The U.S. occupation of Japan and Korea deposed the militarists who had been supported by the large landlords. In the case of decolonization, the lands of former colonizers were confiscated and redistributed. Shifts in political power lead to shifts in property distribution. In the case of Russia and China as well as many former colonies, ideology also played a role in land reform. In those cases, newly powerful ideologues tried to exert direct control over farmers in accordance with a partisan blueprint. Obstacles to Land Reform Not surprisingly, in countries where there were no revolutions or large shifts in power, obstacles to land reform have been quite formidable. Binswanger, Deininger, and Feder argued that land reform met the most obstacles in countries where land ownership was very concentrated in the large haciendas. For the most part, laborers rather than tenants worked the land in those countries, and large landowners fiercely resisted reforms. 12 Compared to other continents, Latin America had the least favorable conditions for land reform. In Brazil, 1. % of the landowners controlled roughly half (46. %) of the land on which crops could be grown. Only 3% of the population owned two-thirds of all arable land. Much of the large landowners’ holdings were left uncultivated and unproductive. Nevertheless, these landowners, who had always held great political power and influence, vigorously opposed any attempt at 12 Binswanger, Deininger, and Feder, “Agricultural Land Relations in the Developing World,” 1993.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts improve the security of tenants may have either positive or negative effects on output. However, on the basis of the theoretical discussion earlier in this chapter, we have good reasons to believe that more radical reforms giving full ownership rights to tenants would have positive effects on output. Persistence of past institutional arrangements. If individually owned farms are more efficient than sharecropping contracts, do differences in efficiency related to differences in institutional arrangements persist over time after land reforms, possibly decades old, have changed the property right arrangements? Ahbijit Banerjee and Lakshmi Iyer found that this was the case in India. 16 When the British colonized India, they instituted two different systems for collecting land revenue. In certain regions such as Bengal and Bihar, land revenue collection was assigned to landlords, the zamindari. During the Mughal Empire, these landlords had been state officials, but over time, they became the de facto owners of large tracts of land. In this landlord-based system, a zamindar was responsible for collecting revenue from the peasants under his jurisdiction. These revenue-collecting rights could be bequeathed to heirs and could also be bought and sold. Sharecropping was quite widespread in the zamindari areas. On the other hand, in regions such as Gujarat, Karnataka, or Andhra Pradesh, land revenue was collected by the British rulers directly from the individual farmers; the British did not encourage a landlord-based system. Early on, these areas also developed a detailed system of titling and land records through a cadastral system that recorded a parcel’s owner, its size, and its value for the purpose of computing land taxes. The land revenue system has historic roots. In the early period of British rule, the landlord system was favored because it required less British administration. Areas colonized after 1820 were more likely to have the direct revenue collection system partly because individual administrators such as Sir Thomas Munro, governor of Madras, or Lord Elphinstone, governor of Bombay, favored the private ownership system. James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill, wrote extensively on British administration in India; he also favored private ownership over landlord-based systems and was quite influential in the East India Company, England’s monopolistic trading company in South Asia. Landlord-based systems were responsible for great inequality in land distribution and wealth, while private ownership systems had a more egalitarian distribution. This distinction between these two systems ceased after Indian independence in 1947. Since then, there have been many land redistribution reforms, but intriguingly, this early institutional difference has had long-run consequences. To document this persistence of past institutional arrangements Banerjee and Iyer regressed variables that measure agricultural investments (irrigation, fertilizer, and high-yield grain varieties) and agricultural productivity on a variety of geographical controls. These controls include altitude, latitude, mean annual rainfall, soil type, coastal versus inland regions, and the proportion of villages, estates, or other tracts of land in a district that was not under landlord 16 Abhijit Banerjee and Lakshmi Iyer, “History, Institutions, and Economic Performance: The Legacy of Colonial Land Tenure Systems in India,” The American Economic Review 95, no. 4 (2005): 1190-1213.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts a negative effect on state agricultural income, while land consolidation legislation had a positive effect. The other two types of reforms had no effects. Land consolidation thus did not affect poverty, but it positively affected output. In other words, it had positive efficiency effects but no significant redistributive effect, which suggests that the richest peasants probably were able to use land consolidation laws to their advantage by buying land adjacent to their properties and selling land further away from their main holdings. As for tenancy reform, it had an important effect on poverty reduction but a negative effect on output. One interpretation of these results is that tenancy reform increased the bargaining power of tenants, which reduced poverty because they could negotiate better tenancy contracts, but the same reform also made it more difficult to evict less productive tenants and tenants who shirked, i.e., did not work much. This latter effect negatively impacted output. Effect of long-term tenure. In another study, Abhijit Banerjee, Paul Gertler, and Maitreesh Ghatak found evidence for a positive output effect of tenancy reform in West Bengal. 15 Their argument was that even though protection from eviction can lead to more shirking, there is another effect that is related to tenants’ stronger bargaining power: When tenants had more power to negotiate terms, the landlord gave them a more favorable contract that granted them a higher share of output. This created incentives to work harder and it offset the negative effects of improved security. The researchers based their evidence on West Bengal, where, in 1977, a new government passed a reform act that made it harder for landlords to evict tenants. The government also launched Operation Barga, a well-publicized campaign in villages to inform tenants of their rights and to encourage them to register as tenants so that their rights could also be registered. This operation was a success and by 1993, more than 65% of sharecropper tenants in West Bengal had registered. To assess the effect of the reforms, the researchers compared the records of rice yields in West Bengal to those in neighboring Bangladesh, where no reforms took place. Rice is the main agricultural product on both sides of the border, covering more than 70% of agricultural land. Before Operation Barga, rice yields were not noticeably different in West Bengal and Bangladesh. However, after the program’s introduction (1984-1993), rice yields were significantly higher in West Bengal by 5 to 18%, leading to a possible increase of yields on sharecropped land of about 42%. The researchers also tried to estimate the effect of the reforms by using another empirical strategy: the registration rate of sharecroppers per district as a measure of the success of Operation Barga. They then regressed rice yields on sharecropper registration with a 1-year lag, controlling for district and for year effects. The success of the reform is thus the effect of a change in registration on rice yields multiplied by the change in the registration rate. At 60%, this strategy provided even higher estimates of the increase in rice yields. Overall, the existing evidence shows that land reform has clear positive effects in terms of reducing poverty. The studies also show that reforms to 15 Abhijit V. Banerjee, Paul J.

Market Development capitalism. Under socialism, there were no markets and prices were fixed. Policy makers and most economists concerned with this transition process thought that once prices were allowed to move freely, markets would emerge spontaneously, creating vigorous economic activity. Instead, they experienced a nasty surprise: when governments in these regions liberalized prices and abandoned central planning, all these countries experienced a huge fall in output. This drop was not only unexpected, but it also took many years before economists could explain what had happened. We will return later in the chapter to this particular episode, but it makes clear that we cannot take markets for granted. When markets develop, the forces of supply and demand ensure that if there is an unsatisfied demand or an expected purchase of goods, it will be matched with unsatisfied supply or expected sales. Once all demands and supplies are matched, if there is still unsatisfied demand, the market price of a commodity will rise, encouraging added supply and discouraging demand until the market is in equilibrium and there is no excess demand or excess supply. Conversely, if there is excess supply, prices will fall until the market has absorbed all the excess. However, the markets described in modern economics textbooks do not emerge that smoothly in the real world. Matching potential sellers with potential buyers can be difficult and information about potential buyers and sellers must be available. Moreover, the market does not readily reach the single equilibrium price. Different sellers may be demanding various prices and different buyers may be offering to pay various prices, all for identical commodities. If information about prices cannot circulate efficiently, identical goods may be sold at different prices. This can result in arbitrage opportunities in which some agents can buy the same good at a lower price and sell it at a higher price than that good would demand elsewhere in the market. It is thus necessary for information about offers, demands, and prices to circulate among buyers and sellers in order for the market to settle on a single price for the same good as represented by the textbook model. Moreover, even single transactions between one buyer and one seller face various problems such as informational asymmetries about the quality of goods, the honesty of agents, commitment problems, etc. For markets to develop, the formal institutions that deal with informational and commitment issues in simple transactions must be in place. When these formal institutions are weak, informal institutions must take their place. However, by themselves these institutions are not enough for markets to develop. Goods must be brought to markets and transportation costs in developing countries, where distances between cities can be considerable, are often very high. Similarly, search costs that bring buyers and sellers together can be quite substantial. To all the general institutional problems related to market development, we must add the specific problems related to poor countries. Specific Problems of Market Development in Poor Countries Even if we were to assume that emerging nations had the same formal institutions in place as are found in advanced countries, the low level of economic development in those emerging nations makes market expansion more difficult. There are various reasons why this is the case.

This drop was not only unexpected, but it also took many years before economists could explain what had happened. We will return later in the chapter to this particular episode, but it makes clear that we cannot take markets for granted. When markets develop, the forces of supply and demand ensure that if there is an unsatisfied demand or an expected purchase of goods, it will be matched with unsatisfied supply or expected sales. Once all demands and supplies are matched, if there is still unsatisfied demand, the market price of a commodity will rise, encouraging added supply and discouraging demand until the market is in equilibrium and there is no excess demand or excess supply. Conversely, if there is excess supply, prices will fall until the market has absorbed all the excess. However, the markets described in modern economics textbooks do not emerge that smoothly in the real world. Matching potential sellers with potential buyers can be difficult and information about potential buyers and sellers must be available. Moreover, the market does not readily reach the single equilibrium price. Different sellers may be demanding various prices and different buyers may be offering to pay various prices, all for identical commodities. If information about prices cannot circulate efficiently, identical goods may be sold at different prices. This can result in arbitrage opportunities in which some agents can buy the same good at a lower price and sell it at a higher price than that good would demand elsewhere in the market. It is thus necessary for information about offers, demands, and prices to circulate among buyers and sellers in order for the market to settle on a single price for the same good as represented by the textbook model. Moreover, even single transactions between one buyer and one seller face various problems such as informational asymmetries about the quality of goods, the honesty of agents, commitment problems, etc. For markets to develop, the formal institutions that deal with informational and commitment issues in simple transactions must be in place. When these formal institutions are weak, informal institutions must take their place. However, by themselves these institutions are not enough for markets to develop. Goods must be brought to markets and transportation costs in developing countries, where distances between cities can be considerable, are often very high. Similarly, search costs that bring buyers and sellers together can be quite substantial. To all the general institutional problems related to market development, we must add the specific problems related to poor countries. Specific Problems of Market Development in Poor Countries Even if we were to assume that emerging nations had the same formal institutions in place as are found in advanced countries, the low level of economic development in those emerging nations makes market expansion more difficult. There are various reasons why this is the case. 


Market Development First, because smaller amounts of commodities are traded in the markets of poorer as compared to richer countries, it is less worthwhile going to court to settle a conflict over a business transaction. There are economies of scale involved in using the court system. A conflict over 1 ton of rice would likely be just as costly to resolve in court as would a conflict over 2,000 tons of rice. Because there are smaller returns with smaller transactions, a court system and its associated costs will be a less attractive option for conflict resolution. An efficient court system is an important institutional condition that reduces transaction costs, encourages business, and thus makes market expansion possible. Second, fines imposed by a court are not effective if the guilty party is unable to pay them. Those who can pay fines are hurt by them, but those who cannot pay fines have nothing to lose. Jail can be a substitute for fines, but incarcerating someone for a minor conflict over a transaction is costly, especially for developing countries with scarce government revenues, and particularly if that person does not represent a danger to society. The incentives provided by the court system not to cheat in business transactions are thus weaker because of this minimal effectiveness of fines. Third, a court system will require proof, such as a signed contract, that a trader promised to pay a certain price for a ton of rice and that the payment was less than the agreed-upon amount; only then is it likely that the court will impose a judicial decision on that trader. However, when there is no contractual agreement, the court must rely on the testimony of witnesses, a more difficult and costly procedure, though one that has been used widely throughout history. Fourth, in poorer countries market development is made more difficult because of the higher costs of gathering and circulating market information about prices and supply and demand, especially without modern communication infrastructure. This lack of market information can depress competition and have a negative impact on incentives for farmers to expand operations and sales further from home. As we have previously mentioned and will discuss further, cell phones and Internet access are very efficient tools for market integration. Fifth, given the low population density and the large size of many emerging nations, transportation costs are a critical element in market development. Without a reliable transportation infrastructure, it can be difficult to transport goods from farms to cities, and this can also contribute to suppressing competition and producer incentives. For example, based on research by Fafchamps and Gabre-Madhin, the chart in Figure 1 shows the factors contributing to marketing costs in the country of Benin in West Africa. 1 As we can see, transportation represents by far the largest cost and constitutes 45% of traders’ total marketing expenses. Marcel Fafchamps and Eleni Gabre-Madhin also document a similar situation in Malawi and several other African countries. 1 Marcel Fafchamps and Eleni Gabre-Madhin, “Agricultural Markets in Benin and Malawi,” The African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics 1, no. 1 (2006): 67-94.

Market Development Transition economies offer a unique historical opportunity to understand how markets emerge. Under socialism, free markets were generally prohibited and did not play an important role in resource allocation. The goal of the transition from socialism to capitalism was to build market economies on the ashes of central planning. However, in those countries making the transition, when prices were liberalized precisely for the purpose of creating markets, there generally was a huge fall in production. Why did this occur and how can we explain it? What does it teach us about market development in general and why specifically was China able to avoid such an output fall? Rural monopsonies (single buyers on a market) are not uncommon in developing countries. Farmers may indeed only have access to a single buyer who offers them extremely low prices for their crops. How this affects farmers’ incentives and how farmers can avoid monopsonists are also questions we will examine in this chapter. We will explore to what extent markets for similar goods are integrated over large geographical areas in developing countries and we will discuss how to measure market integration and discuss what are the biggest obstacles to it in developing countries. In addition, the role of transport and communication infrastructures, and regulatory barriers to market integration will be part of our discussion. Last but not least, a critical topic in the discussion of market development and market integration is famine. When do famines occur and what is the role that market imperfections play in extreme food shortages? Famines can usually be prevented, but they often occur as the result of entitlement or institutional failures. Those members of society who are socially and economically most marginalized are the first to be deprived of sufficient food when shortages occur. We will discuss the role political systems appear to play in famines; some of the most terrible famines of the 20th century have occurred under Communist regimes such as North Korea, while a famine has never happened in a democracy. Finally, we will discuss the topic of the food crisis that occurred in 2008 as rising food and oil prices impacted the poorest people on the planet. Institutions and Market Development In this section, we will examine the link between institutions and market development. We start by drawing on material to see how institutions contribute to market development. We will then analyze specific problems affecting market development in poor countries: higher transaction costs, higher costs of court proceedings, and issues with transportation and communication infrastructure. We will then look at the role of business networks in market development. Taking Markets for Granted Standard economics takes markets for granted. In the context of market development, this can be a huge mistake; it was made by policy makers in Central and Eastern Europe as these regions transitioned from socialism to

Market Development Farmers from a local cooperative in Kenya saw their lives change when the Environment Liaison Centre International (ELCI) in Nairobi provided them with Internet access. Using e-mail, the farmers were able to establish a relationship with the U.S.-based EarthMarketplace service to sell their produce directly to North American consumers. The Internet helped these farmers to bypass the traditional middlemen who would purchase their produce at a much lower price and sell at a higher price. As a result, these farmers’ revenues were significantly increased. Similarly, a British supermarket is planning to use e-mail to conduct “just-in-time” purchases of chili peppers from a Kenyan farm by flying them overnight directly to the supermarket as soon as they are harvested. In Niger, Tuareg craftspeople are also using the Internet to sell their products worldwide. Their crafts appear alongside many other African cultural products in a “cybermall” hosted on a Canadian website. These examples demonstrate how the Internet can contribute to the growth of markets in developing economies. Poor producers who were in contact with only a single buyer and able to supply only a limited market with their crops or crafts, are now negotiating for good prices with buyers worldwide. As a result, they can invest in their operations and expand their production. But while innovations such as the Internet and cellular phones have expanded market opportunities and reduced telecommunication costs, they do not by themselves provide sufficient conditions for markets to develop. Other factors are necessary, as we will discuss in this chapter by analyzing the emergence and expansion of markets in developing countries. M arket development, is significantly related to issues of property rights. Weaker government institutions and property rights laws make market expansion more difficult, while better enforcement of property rights has been demonstrated to facilitate market development. For vigorous markets to develop, strong governmental and legal systems are necessary. Not only is market development subject to the standard transaction costs (adverse selection, moral hazard, commitment and hold-up problems, etc.), but also there are specific problems related to market development in poor countries that we will discuss in this chapter. For example, we will demonstrate that, when a conflict arises between the parties involved in a transaction, it is more costly to use the courts in developing countries even if they operate efficiently. The relative absence of modern communication technologies and insufficient transport infrastructure also presents problems for the creation and expansion of markets in developing countries. In addition, market participants are continually involved in a search process that enables buyers and sellers to find each other. We will examine how this process is facilitated or hindered in different developing countries.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts land to build tourist resorts and factories, and the peasants who sold their ejidos became even more vulnerable economically as a result. In Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, important land reforms introduced after World War II drastically redistributed farmland from the wealthy landlords to small farmers, often the landlords’ former tenants. These reforms were comprehensive and egalitarian in their design. In Japan and South Korea, the U.S. occupation forces implemented the reforms. Traditionally, Japanese tenant farmers had to give roughly half of their rice crop to the landlord. Because the landlords had supported Japan’s military regime during the war, one of the objectives of land reform was to break their traditional power and dismantle the country’s feudal social and political systems, particularly in the countryside. In South Korea, much of the reforms consisted of confiscation of land that had been held before and during World War II by the Japanese occupation government, Japanese companies, and individual Japanese citizens. Wealthy Korean landowners were also obliged to divest most of their land. Because American occupation forces were concerned about a Communist takeover on the Korean peninsula, they decided to take a radical approach and give the land to the peasant farmers in order to prevent the Communists from gaining support in the countryside. As a result, a new class of independent family farmers was created in both Japan and South Korea. Note that in both countries, reforms were the result of a foreign occupation power with a specific interest in making the reforms happen. In Taiwan, land reform was introduced by the Chinese nationalist regime after the end of World War II, with the help of the U.S. government. It was targeted, to a large extent, at lands held by former Japanese owners who had fled Taiwan after Japan’s defeat. Taiwanese landowners whose properties were expropriated were compensated through the sale of properties seized from the Japanese. While other countries in East Asia, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, did not undergo radical land reform as in Japan, South Korea or Taiwan, important land reforms did take place in India after decolonization. The 1949 Indian constitution stipulated that Indian states had the power to institute land reforms. Four types of reforms took place in the decades following independence. The first type was tenancy reforms, which were aimed at securing the rights of tenant sharecroppers and making their eviction more difficult. Provided the tenant paid his share of the harvest to the landlord (which could not exceed 25% of the crop) and did not leave the land fallow, his rights to work the land were secure. In some cases, tenancy reforms even involved attempts to transfer ownership rights to tenants. The second type of reform aimed at abolishing the intermediaries, the zamindari , who collected tax revenues for the British and extracted large rents from tenants. The third type of reform provided limits on the amount of land an individual could own with a view toward redistributing it from the wealthy to the landless. The fourth type of reform consolidated disparate landholdings by organizing an exchange or trade of land so that individual owners could work on contiguous plots. Consolidation laws were implemented vigorously in some states but halfheartedly elsewhere. Later in this chapter, we will discuss the effects of these four types of land reform. In South Africa, starting in 1994, the government bought large landholdings from white owners and redistributed it to poor black farmers. The objective

Economic Growth Constant Returns to Scale and Diminishing Marginal Products To introduce the Solow model, let us return to the Cobb-Douglas production function assuming for now that A t = A , i.e., it is constant over time: Y t = AK t a L t 1 a If we divide both sides of the equation by L t we get: Y t / L t = AK t a L t 1 a 1 = A ( K t / L t ) a Using the notations: y t = Y t / L t and k t = K t / L t , we then have the following equation relating average labor productivity and capital intensity: y t = A k t a (11) This simple equation says that labor productivity increases with capital intensity. This relationship is important for development because it points to the critical role of capital accumulation in increasing labor productivity. We can obtain this relation between labor productivity and capital intensity because of the assumption of constant returns to scale. 8 Figure 1 shows this relation, which highlights a key feature of the Solow model: average capital productivity ( Y t / K t = y t / k t when one divides both sides by L t ) decreases as capital in the economy increases. Figure 1 shows this 8 Try inserting parameter b either larger or smaller than 1 a as an exponent of L t in the production function and you will see that you cannot get rid of L t in the numerator. FIGURE 1 The Solow Model Output per capita Capital intensity y t / k t k t y t y t H Ak t α Output per capita y t is expressed as a function of capital intensity (capital per worker). The slope y t / k t represents average productivity of capital. This slope decreases as capital intensity increases, meaning that average capital productivity decreases as capital intensity increases.

The researchers found that in nonlandlord districts, on average 6. % of additional land was subject to irrigation. Given that roughly 28% of land was irrigated, that represents an improvement of 24% over the average proportion of land irrigated. They also found that in nonlandlord districts there was greater use of fertilizer and of high yield-varieties of rice, wheat, and other cereal grains, which resulted in higher yields in those districts. How can we explain this persistence of historical differences in institutional arrangements? Banerjee and Iyer argue that the best explanation is the difference between the political environments found in former landlord versus nonlandlord districts. One important difference is the provision of public services. Since the 1960s, former landlord districts have spent nearly 50% less on rural development per capita than the former nonlandlord districts. This period also has seen significant technological change in agriculture in the nonlandlord districts. Nonlandlord districts also invested more in health and education, achieving higher literacy rates and lower infant mortality rates. These differences in public expenditures can arguably be attributed to an atmosphere of class conflict and class resentment in the former landlord districts. Chapter Summary Worldwide Land Distribution and Land Contracts Land is distributed equally in Asia and very unequally in Latin America. While small private farming is predominant in Asia, communal farming on small plots is the predominant type of land distribution in Africa. Latin America typically has large plantations, while in South Asia, sharecropping predominates. Properties of Land Contracts Individual privately owned farms are more efficient because they provide optimal incentives for effort and investment, but farmers bear all the risks. Farm size depends on the availability of technology. Economic Effects of Land Contracts Empirical studies confirm the theoretical predictions for the effects of different land arrangements. Patterns of land ownership and farm size are explained less convincingly by efficiency measures than by historical and institutional legacies. Land Reform Land reform is the redistribution to small farmers of large tracts of land owned by landlords. Land reform most often occurred after important shifts in political power such as revolutions, foreign occupations, or decolonization. Large and politically powerful landowners resisted both radical land reform and more modest reforms such as the redistribution of idle land to landless peasants. Land reform has had positive effects in terms of both poverty reduction and output. In India, reforms that provide more security to tenants have had both positive and negative effects on productivity.

Compare the situation of two farmers, one who owns his land and the other who rents it from a landlord. In good times (which happen with probability 1 2 ), the owner-farmer earns an income of 125. In bad times (also with probability 1 2 ), he earns an income of 75. The tenant works on a farm that is twice as large and earns an income of 250 in good times and 150 in bad times (both with probability of 1 2 ). However, he must pay a rent of 100.

Rural Land Rights and Contracts land reform. Instead of asking for radical land redistribution, peasants fought hard for the more modest goal of redistributing the uncultivated land. For decades, Brazil had a “landless worker movement,” the MST (in Portuguese, Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra ). The MST was estimated to be the largest social movement in Latin America, with approximately 1.5 million landless members organized in 23 out of Brazil’s 26 states. Beginning in late 1980 and early 1981, over 6,000 landless families established a squatters’ encampment on a portion of land located between three unproductive estates in Brazil’s southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. With the support of many associations and organizations, including many progressive Catholic clergy, the families eventually pressured the military government into expropriating nearby uncultivated land for the purposes of agrarian reform. 13 In 2005, the MST organized a popular march to demand that left-wing president Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva implement promises to allocate unused land to landless farmers. The large landowners have strongly resisted even these limited reforms and their private militias have routinely gunned down peasant activists fighting for land redistribution. Bolivia adopted an important land reform law after universal suffrage was introduced after the 1952 revolution by the left-wing nationalist revolutionary movement in power. However, due to the weakness of successive governments and the fragility of Bolivia’s democracy, the law’s implementation was very slow. By 1970, only 45% of peasant families had received title to land. When he took office in 2006, the new socialist president, Juan Evo Morales, a member of the Aymara tribe, restarted land reform. In 2006, Bolivia’s senate passed a bill authorizing the government to redistribute land among the nation’s impoverished, and mostly indigenous, peasants. Politicians representing the landlords, however, expressed adamant opposition to the bill. They pledged to reverse the reforms but have, so far, been unsuccessful. In Chile, no significant land reform took place before the 1960s. Under Marxist President Salvador Allende (1970-1973), a radical land reform program was undertaken, and farms of more than 198 acres (80 hectares) were expropriated. However, when General Augusto Pinochet overthrew Allende in a military coup in 1973 with the support of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the process was halted and partially reversed. Because Pinochet represented the interests of the large landholders, expropriated land was either returned to its previous owners or auctioned off to the highest bidder. Guatemala’s recent history has been characterized by intense violence, due in part to issues of land reform. In 1954, a coup orchestrated by the C.I.A., with the support of a coalition of landowners and right-wing paramilitary organizations, overthrew President Jacobo Árbenz after he expropriated large tracts of land exploited by the United Fruit Company to grow bananas. Between the 1970s and the 1990s, the Guatemalan army actively repressed and even massacred Indian peasants while rural guerillas fought for land redistribution. The army destroyed 450 Mayan villages and one million peasants became homeless. The army was accused by international public opinion of orchestrating 13 Gabriel A.

Market Development price and the quantities will be exactly the same as under normal price liberalization, except that now only the quantity ( Q E Q P ) is sold at price P E . This is the dual track that results in the planned price and the planned quantity, and the market price and the market quantity. The dual-track system was implemented in China beginning in 1984 in all sectors of the economy. Results were as predicted by theory; firms continued to respect previous contractual arrangements of the plan while they also seized opportunities to provide additional output on the market track. Over time, the plan track became increasingly less important while the market track continued to expand. Price liberalization thus took place in the context of 10% annual GDP growth rates and no output fall was ever observed. The dual track implemented in China is especially interesting because it prevented the output fall observed in Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, because the planned quantity Q P must continue to be delivered, there cannot be any output fall if planned obligations are fulfilled. There can only be an increase in output on the market track. The logic is very simple but also very powerful. Note that the reasoning does not rely at all on the supply and demand framework that we used only to simplify the exposition. Because of this logic, there was thus no output fall in China under the dual-track method. Over time, the market track continued to increase relative to the plan track, which was eventually abolished. The dual-track method thus proved to be a very useful tool to prevent the kind of production chain disruption that was observed in Central and Eastern Europe. FIGURE 2 An Illustration of Dual-Track Price Liberalization S D Q P Q P Q E P E P P With the dual-track system, the plan track Q P is delivered at price P P and ( Q E Q P ) is delivered on the market track at the equilibrium market price P E .

Rural Land Rights and Contracts communist ideology was the motivating force behind these revolutions, the Russian Bolshevik Party and the Chinese Communist Party soon nationalized the land and organized agriculture into collective farms under centralized government control. Stalin instituted land collectivization in 1929 through a brutal process in which harvests were confiscated from the peasants, who were forced to work under police supervision to provide grain to Russian cities. Millions of Ukrainian peasants died from starvation during this process. In China, a collectivization process was launched in 1955 that organized farmers into communes. Incentives were virtually nonexistent under collectivized farming because the peasants worked as wage laborers and, as a result, land productivity plummeted. The Chinese commune system lasted until the agricultural reforms of 1978 under Deng Xiaoping. In Africa, countries such as Ghana under Kwame Nkrumah, Guinea under Ahmed Sékou Touré, and Tanzania under Julius Nyerere, introduced land reforms aimed at collectivizing farms. In Tanzania, these were called the ujamaa villages. However, the conditions in Africa that preceded these efforts were vastly different from those in Russia or China before the introduction of collective farming. The attempts to transition from Africa’s traditional communal subsistence farming to more modern collectivist farming failed. No incentives were put in place to increase productivity, and forced collectivization violated local communal traditions. Land reform was one of the primary motivating factors of the Mexican Revolution, which lasted from 1910 to 1921. A radical program was launched under the presidency of Alvaro Obregon to confiscate the landholdings of large domestic and foreign landowners, and redistribute it to peasants. Politically, this was possible because the landlords who owned the large estates, or haciendas , lost their hold on power during the revolution. Interestingly, many peasants saw the reforms as an end to the rule of the Spanish colonial landlords and a return to the communal land ownership of the ejido system that had existed during the Aztec Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries. Under this system, peasants collectively owned an ejido, an area of communal farmland that they could work but could not sell. The revolution nationalized the land and gave it to the peasants to work and a state-owned bank provided them with credit. Initially, the implementation of land reforms was slow; by 1928, less than 10% of landholdings had been redistributed as ejidos. However, between 1934 and 1940, President Lázaro Cárdenas accelerated land reforms and redistributed close to half of the land in the form of ejidos. Further reforms were undertaken in the 1970s under President Luis Echeverria, when large foreign-owned plantations were turned into ejidos. The typical size of the ejido was usually too small, however, to be profitable using modern farming technology. Moreover, because farmers could not resell the land, there could be no market for the ejidos and they could not be used as collateral, so credit was not available to farmers. Under President Carlos Salinas (1988-1994), sale of ejido land, as well as its use as collateral, was finally permitted. One of the reasons for this reform was NAFTA (the North American Free Trade agreement), signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 1994. After it became law, U.S. corporations wanted to buy land in Mexico to set up manufacturing facilities. Wealthy Mexicans bought up ejid o

The Role of Credit Markets in Development remains in his firm. In case he cannot pay back the loan, limited liability makes it impossible to extract any payment from him. The bank cannot seize his private assets or force him to work extra to pay back the loan. 4 If the tailor does not pay back the loan in the bad state, this induces him to prefer the risky project over the safe one. The bank would obviously prefer the tailor to choose the safe project because he will then pay back the loan with 100% probability. From the point of view of society, or social welfare, it would also be better if the tailor were to choose the safe project because the total return to both the tailor and the bank is then higher. We thus conclude from this example that when an agent borrows and has limited liability, he may have an incentive to choose a risky project over a safe one and this may be bad from the point of view of social welfare. This example also helps us to distinguish between adverse selection and moral hazard concepts. Adverse selection arises when a bank faces loan demands for both safe and risky projects, and has no information about the quality or risk of the individual projects. Adverse selection means that when interest rates rise, entrepreneurs with safe projects stop asking for loans so that the bank only faces risky projects. Moral hazard arises when the bank cannot observe the choices borrowers make between safe and risky projects. Moral hazard means that the borrower will likely choose the risky project with its possibility of higher returns, whereas the bank would prefer the borrower choose the safe project. Note that the example above is formulated as a case of moral hazard. Moral hazard in the lending relationship does not mean that the borrower will always choose a risky project with a higher expected return over a safe project. The borrower may, for example, engage in an unobserved level of effort and this choice may affect the probability of the expected returns. If, in the example discussed above, the tailor chooses to put low effort into the risky project, it would yield 280 with 50% probability and zero with 50% probability. If, instead, he chooses a high level of effort, then the project would yield 280 with 80% probability and zero with 20% probability. Adverse Selection and Credit Rationing Let us first discuss the case of adverse selection. Assume that 50% of entrepreneurs have a risky project (280 return with 50% probability and zero return with 50% probability) and the other 50% have a safe project (150 with 100% probability). Assume that a bank knows the types of projects and their proportions, but does not know which borrower has a safe or a risky project. If the bank did have this information, it would only lend to those borrowers with safe projects. When the bank considers making a loan, a firm’s project could thus be either risky (with 50% probability) or safe (with 50% probability). How much would the bank have to charge in interest so as not to lose money, that is, in order to realize a loan repayment of 100? 4 Note that even when there are no limited liability laws in developing countries, small entrepreneurs in urban areas can find ways to run away from their obligations to a bank and reemerge elsewhere in a city and go on with their lives. By doing so, they shield themselves from the downside aspects of risky projects. 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development This presents a problem in developing countries because the size of the loans needed in these nations tends to be small due to the small scale of farming and entrepreneurial operations. Thus, as tools to fight moral hazard, both collateral and monitoring tend to work less efficiently in the development context either because people are too poor to have acceptable collateral or because the loans they need are too small and involve monitoring costs that are high relative to the size of the loan. Monitoring and Variation in Interest Rates In developing countries, banks and other lenders can charge borrowers very different interest rates. People who deposit their money in a bank may also receive very different rates for those deposits. A large variation in interest rates is often observed within the same region, town, or village—or even within the same industrial or economic sector (textile, transport, catering, etc.). Loan contracts in India’s rural sector may vary between 24% and 48% on an annual basis. Amil Dasgupta’s Report on Informal Credit Markets in India: Summary reported that professional moneylenders in rural areas, who provide about three-quarters of the commercial loans outside the formal banking sector, were charging interest rates between 36% and 60% or more. 5 In other countries, similar findings emerge; lower interest rates are usually charged on larger loans, typically those made to wealthier borrowers, while higher interest rates are charged on smaller loans, often those made to less affluent individuals. This variation in interest rates is consistent with the importance of loan monitoring. If the monitoring costs of a loan are primarily fixed, then it is relatively more costly to monitor smaller loans than larger ones. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that higher interest rates are charged for smaller loans and lower interest rates are charged for larger loans. If those who apply for larger loans also have collateral, then they would likely be charged an even smaller interest rate. In any case, it is apparent that loan monitoring plays an important role in developing economies. Small loans and the resulting need for monitoring are thus important reasons for high interest rates. An alternative explanation for variation in interest rates might be monopolistic lending. In advanced market economies, the difference between rates on loans and rates on deposits, called the intermediation margin , is usually taken as a measure of the level of competitiveness in the banking sector. The higher the margin, the less competitive the banking sector and vice versa. A high intermediation margin is often observed in developing countries, but it is not always a sign of monopolistic lending. Borrowers often have a choice between various lenders, even when they live in small villages. 6 5 Amil Dasgupta, Report on Informal Credit Markets in India: Summary (New Delhi: National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, 1989): 140. 6 See, for example, Abhijit V.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development This presents a problem in developing countries because the size of the loans needed in these nations tends to be small due to the small scale of farming and entrepreneurial operations. Thus, as tools to fight moral hazard, both collateral and monitoring tend to work less efficiently in the development context either because people are too poor to have acceptable collateral or because the loans they need are too small and involve monitoring costs that are high relative to the size of the loan. Monitoring and Variation in Interest Rates In developing countries, banks and other lenders can charge borrowers very different interest rates. People who deposit their money in a bank may also receive very different rates for those deposits. A large variation in interest rates is often observed within the same region, town, or village—or even within the same industrial or economic sector (textile, transport, catering, etc.). Loan contracts in India’s rural sector may vary between 24% and 48% on an annual basis. Amil Dasgupta’s Report on Informal Credit Markets in India: Summary reported that professional moneylenders in rural areas, who provide about three-quarters of the commercial loans outside the formal banking sector, were charging interest rates between 36% and 60% or more. 5 In other countries, similar findings emerge; lower interest rates are usually charged on larger loans, typically those made to wealthier borrowers, while higher interest rates are charged on smaller loans, often those made to less affluent individuals. This variation in interest rates is consistent with the importance of loan monitoring. If the monitoring costs of a loan are primarily fixed, then it is relatively more costly to monitor smaller loans than larger ones. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that higher interest rates are charged for smaller loans and lower interest rates are charged for larger loans. If those who apply for larger loans also have collateral, then they would likely be charged an even smaller interest rate. In any case, it is apparent that loan monitoring plays an important role in developing economies. Small loans and the resulting need for monitoring are thus important reasons for high interest rates. An alternative explanation for variation in interest rates might be monopolistic lending. In advanced market economies, the difference between rates on loans and rates on deposits, called the intermediation margin , is usually taken as a measure of the level of competitiveness in the banking sector. The higher the margin, the less competitive the banking sector and vice versa. A high intermediation margin is often observed in developing countries, but it is not always a sign of monopolistic lending. Borrowers often have a choice between various lenders, even when they live in small villages. 6 5 Amil Dasgupta, Report on Informal Credit Markets in India: Summary (New Delhi: National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, 1989): 140. 6 See, for example, Abhijit V.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development The Netrakona district in Bangladesh, with a population of 1.9 million, is bordered on the north by India. It is one of the country’s poorest districts and highly vulnerable to flooding, similar to many other regions in this flat nation. Agriculture is the main economic activity and there is limited potential for the development of industry or the service sectors. About half of households make a meager living from farming small plots (less than one hectare), for the most part growing only rice. They would gain by adding vegetable and fruit crops, but they have no access to the credit they need to diversify. Their situation reflects that of hundreds of millions of poor farmers in developing countries. Many Indian farmers have suffered from a different problem than that of the Bangladeshi farmers. A wave of suicides has swept the Indian countryside. Between 1997 and 2007, as many as 150,000 Indian farmers committed suicide, and the major cause was reported to have been an unbearable debt burden. Because of the Green Revolution that took place from the 1960s to the 1980s, farmers were able to make significant improvements in land productivity thanks to investments in fertilizer, new, highly productive strains of rice and other crops, irrigation systems, and more modern farming technologies. Loans for these new investments were, however, usually financed by local moneylenders, the only source of credit for most farmers, who charged a very high interest rate for loans. The high interest rates imposed a significant financial burden on farmers and when poor harvests made it impossible to service their debts fully, farmers had to sell their land and their belongings, sometimes even forcing their wives into prostitution. When nothing else was left to sell, desperate farmers chose to commit suicide. T hese examples from Bangladesh and India are illustrative of some of the problems of credit markets in developing countries. Financial systems tend to be underdeveloped, a condition that is detrimental to economic development and social welfare. Efficiently functioning and equitable credit markets are important for development because they improve the allocation of capital. In the past, many developing countries have suffered from misallocation of capital; scarce government money was often given to inefficient, largescale projects while poor farmers and aspiring small-scale entrepreneurs did not have access even to modest loans to start a family business. Credit relationships are rife with transactions costs. Informational asymmetries are present when lenders do not know the reliability of borrowers. Commitment problems are also a problem; borrowers may default after obtaining a loan. Because of these problems, banks are generally unwilling to lend unless a borrower puts up collateral to secure the debt.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development probability plus the return in the bad state (zero) times its probability. 2 The safe project thus has a higher expected return. This is the project any rational risk-neutral investor would choose. If the tailor is risk averse, then he will prefer the safe project even more because it has no risk, whereas the other project is clearly risky. Risk-averse people put more value on what they could lose than on what they could win. Losing 100 entails more utility loss (more dissatisfaction) to a risk-averse investor than winning 100 gives that investor a utility gain (more satisfaction). 3 Assume that the tailor has no capital and must borrow 100 from the bank to finance the initial investment. Also assume that he must pay back 110 to the bank out of the return on the chosen project. We know that if the tailor did not have to borrow, he would choose the safe project because it brings the highest expected return. But if he must borrow, will he still choose the safe project? We will now show that this is not the case and that the tailor prefers to choose the risky project when borrowing from the bank! With the safe project, the expected net return to the tailor after paying back the loan with interest is 150 110 = 40. With the risky project, the expected net return is 0. (280 110) + 0. ( ) = 85. Indeed, if the outcome is good, the tailor gets 280 and must pay back the loan with interest. There is thus a net return of 170 and this occurs with 50% probability. However, there is also a 50% probability that the project yields zero return. In that case, the tailor cannot pay the bank back and the bank then faces a “bad loan” situation. Because the tailor will only pay back the loan if it generates a return, and this happens with only a 50% probability, he will now prefer the risky project to the safe project because the former has an expected net return of 85 while the latter has an expected net return of 40. This is because of the limited liability of the tailor: he cannot be made liable for a larger amount than the money that 2 When there is risk involved, economists use the term “state of the world” to refer to particular contingencies. In this example, we assume two states of the world: a good state and a bad state. 3 Another way of looking at this is to consider two wagers that have the same expected return (say, winning and losing 100 with 50-50 probabilities and winning and losing 200 with the same probabilities); the risk-averse person always prefers the wager with less risk (here, choosing the wager with 100 rather than the wager with 200).

The Role of Credit Markets in Development Note also that a bank can charge a lower interest rate to borrowers with collateral. Without collateral, the bank would have to charge an interest rate of 100 in order to break even because there would be a 50% chance that a loan will not be repaid because of moral hazard. With collateral, an interest rate of 0 is enough to break even. Providing collateral is more difficult in developing countries than in wealthier nations because most people in emerging economies are too poor to have wealth they can use as collateral. There are additional obstacles for banks, as well. Take the example of the Indian tailor who borrows to establish a taxi business. In the case of default, the bank may seize the taxi. However, the tailor may instead disappear with the taxi and work in the informal economy in another city, making it nearly impossible for the bank to find him. Seizing land as collateral in a rural village is also less attractive for a bank. The land is only of value if the bank can resell it and in a poor village, there may be no one who has the money to buy the land. Moreover, villagers may protest the seizure of the land, resulting in a costly foreclosure operation for the bank. The bank may also decide that a poor farmer’s land has little or no collateral value and will deny the farmer’s loan application. At that point, credit rationing would occur, as discussed above. Moral Hazard and Monitoring Monitoring is another tool for preventing moral hazard that can be more useful in the context of the development of credit markets. A bank may closely monitor the use of a loan in order to obtain information about the borrower’s choices. Monitoring may alleviate, or even eliminate, informational asymmetries, but it comes at a cost for the bank. Let us continue to use the example we have discussed above. Assume that if the bank spends 40 on monitoring, it can make sure the borrower chooses the safe project instead of the risky one. In that case, the bank will lend only if it gets at least 140 back. If it charges 150 (with an interest rate of 50%), it only gets 10 back as interest. The disadvantage of monitoring is its cost, which drives up the interest rate. With monitoring, the bank would have to charge a higher interest rate to break even than it would charge for a loan secured with collateral. Even in a situation without collateral, monitoring still brings down the interest rate compared to a situation of unconditional lending and moral hazard. Indeed, with unconditional lending, the bank has to charge an interest rate of 100% to break even, whereas with monitoring, the minimum interest rate is only 40%. As long as the cost of monitoring is lower than the minimum interest rate under unconditional lending, monitoring is advantageous. In general, monitoring works better for larger rather than smaller loans because regardless of the size of the loan, the costs of monitoring will often be comparable as those costs are frequently fixed. Imagine a project twice the size of the example we have been discussing so far. The project would thus cost 200 and bring a safe return of 300. If the cost of monitoring is still 40, the minimum charge to break even is 240, which represents an interest rate of 20% (40/200) instead of 40% for a project half the size. Loan monitoring tends to be more advantageous for large projects and less advantageous for small projects if there is a fixed cost of monitoring, independent of the project’s size. 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development Note also that a bank can charge a lower interest rate to borrowers with collateral. Without collateral, the bank would have to charge an interest rate of 100 in order to break even because there would be a 50% chance that a loan will not be repaid because of moral hazard. With collateral, an interest rate of 0 is enough to break even.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development Dealing with Default Default is a risk that banks face when they loan money. One reason for default might be that an economic project does not generate enough return to repay a loan. Another might be that the borrower decides not to pay back a loan. This is called strategic default , a situation in which the borrower is able to fulfill his debt obligations but decides not to. Think of the example of the taxi driver who decides to run away and not pay back his loan. His decision might be the consequence of not having enough money to repay the bank, but he might also choose to run away even though he could, in principle, service his loan. Seen this way, default is a commitment problem. Imagine that the borrower has limited liability and that the value of the outstanding loan is higher than whatever assets the bank can seize from him. The borrower may choose to default out of self-interest. This is economic opportunism, but it is economically rational. After the 2008 collapse of housing prices in the United States, many households that were “underwater” with a mortgage higher than the market value of their homes, decided to walk away from their mortgages. This type of behavior can be observed in both developing and developed economies. Default due to a commitment problem does not necessarily entail an informational problem, as is the case with adverse selection and moral hazard. The bank might have been monitoring the activities of the borrower and how he or she made use of the bank loan. The bank may be perfectly aware that the borrower is defaulting for strategic reasons, but may be unable to prove in court where the money has gone, or the cost of locating it might be too high to warrant the expense. The borrower may disappear or even simply hide the money and declare bankruptcy. As a result, the bank might not be able to get its money back, even though it knows that there has been a strategic default. How can banks enforce loan repayment and avoid strategic defaults by borrowers? Monitoring is obviously not an adequate solution unless the bank knows exactly where the money is. Collateral is a possible instrument to protect against strategic default; if the bank can seize assets equivalent to what it is owed, there is a clear incentive for the borrower to repay the loan. In the absence of credible forms of collateral, the only instrument that may help is a borrower’s reputation for honesty. If a borrower has a solid history of loan repayment, then the bank will likely lend to that person even in the absence of collateral. The debtor will not want to default because of a damaged reputation and the inability to borrow in the future. Unfortunately, reputation is no help for those who have not had the opportunity to build a history of reliable loan repayment. Contrary to what we might expect, loan defaults are rather low in developing countries. A study by Irfan Aleem showed that the median rate of default in Pakistan was between 1% and 2%. 7 Most studies also tend to find that the costs of default are rather small in emerging economies. This suggests that the diversity of interest rates observed in developing countries cannot be 7 Irfan Aleem, “Imperfect Information, Screening, and the Costs of Informal Lending: A Study of a Rural Credit Market in Pakistan,” The World Bank Economic Review 4, no. 3 (1990): 329-349.

Market Development Review Questions 1. In this exercise and the next, we formalize the discussion of monopsony. Assume that a farmer can produce Q L of output at a per unit cost c L under a traditional technology. Assume that using a modern technology with investment I, the farmer can produce Q H of output at a per unit cost c H . Calculate the break-even price for the farmer under both technologies, that is, the price at which the farmer makes zero profits. What price level will encourage the farmer to invest in the new technology rather than the traditional one? What price can the monopsonist charge the farmer under both technologies? What effect does this have on the investment choice of the farmer? Explain. 2. In this exercise, we examine the conditions under which monopsony is inevitable. Call p M the market price that a trader can realize on the market and call T the transportation cost for moving goods from the village to the market. If there are two traders, assume that the probability one of them buys the goods from the farmer is 50% (alternatively, assume that the trader can only buy half of the farmer’s output) but both traders will incur Key Terms dual-track liberalization entitlement set investment specificity market integration market track monopsony plan track search frictions low prices for agricultural products. Monopsonists can hold up farmers and discourage them from making investments that improve agricultural productivity. Competition is often not sustainable because farming communities are too dispersed to sustain competition between buyers. Farmers have the opportunity to bypass monopsonists by forming marketing cooperatives. However, they often face severe collective-action problems when undertaking the establishment of a cooperative. Market Integration Markets are said to be integrated when the prices for the same product in different geographical areas move together. While prices need not be the same because transportation costs must be taken into account, to what extent prices for the same goods move in the same direction at the same time is an important criterion for market integration. We have analyzed three types of obstacles to market integration: communication obstacles, transportation obstacles, and regulatory obstacles. Lack of communication means that information on supply and demand in different areas is not efficiently transmitted and market adjustments cannot take place. Lack of adequate transportation infrastructure can significantly hamper market development, while infrastructure investment contributes to market integration. Regulatory obstacles can be diverse and government authorities may constrain the movement of goods across geographical areas or jurisdictions, all of which create formidable obstacles to market integration. Famines There is a relationship between market development and famines, which do not generally occur because of actual shortages in food availability resulting from floods or droughts, but rather because of entitlement failures. In a famine, the weakest members of a society are excluded from food allocation either because they are too poor to afford enough food to survive or because they are given low priority in food distribution in families and communities. Low market development exacerbates famines. Famines have never occurred in democratic countries, suggesting that political accountability and a free press work to prevent them.

Market Development central planning, their emergence and subsequent development were key parts of the transition process. Analyzing this process can provide unique insights into nascent markets and their expansion in developing economies. The Output Fall in Central and Eastern Europe Most economists thought that when prices were liberalized in the formerly socialist economies of Europe, market forces would immediately kick in and bring marked improvements in the allocation of resources. Economists were quite surprised at the unexpected result: in all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, price liberalization led to a large fall in output. Table 1 provides some figures for growth before and after the transition process began in these nations. Price liberalization took place in 1990 in Poland; in 1991 in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia), Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary; in 1992 in Russia; and in 1994 in the Ukraine. Looking at Table 1, we see that these nations experienced significant output falls during those years. Initially, economists had a hard time even believing the numbers and thought there might be some statistical mistake or artifact influencing them. It was difficult to accept that output could fall in countries where the economy was so far from its production possibility frontier. In other words, when there was so much room for efficiency improvements, why did output fall? The reason economists were surprised by the figures is that they evaluated the economies of these nations in terms of traditional price theory; that is, the theory of supply and demand. They could not arrive at an explanation that made sense using that model. Why? In supply and demand theory, output cannot fall unless there is an exogenous fall in demand (a downward shift in the demand schedule) or a large increase in costs (an upward shift in the supply schedule). Some of these factors were observed in certain transition countries TABLE 1 The Output Fall: Real GDP Growth Rates in Central and Eastern Europe 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 Poland 0.2 11.6 7.6 2.6 3.8 5.0 Hungary 0.7 3.5 11.9 3.0 0.9 2 Czech Republic 1.4 0.4 14.2 6.4 0.9 2.6 Slovakia 1.4 0.4 14.5 7.0 4.1 4.8 Russia n.a. n.a. 13 19 12 15 Ukraine 4 3 12 17 17 23 Bulgaria 0.5 9.1 11.7 7.3 2.4 1.4 Romania 5.8 5.6 12.9 10.0 1.3 3.4 Output fell not only in the year prices were liberalized in transition countries, but in subsequent years as well.

Market Development central planning, their emergence and subsequent development were key parts of the transition process. Analyzing this process can provide unique insights into nascent markets and their expansion in developing economies. The Output Fall in Central and Eastern Europe Most economists thought that when prices were liberalized in the formerly socialist economies of Europe, market forces would immediately kick in and bring marked improvements in the allocation of resources. Economists were quite surprised at the unexpected result: in all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, price liberalization led to a large fall in output.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development explained, or can be explained only partially, by the need of creditors to charge higher interest rates in order to cover losses from defaults. Does that mean that default is not an issue in these nations? Not necessarily. It may be that the fear of default is an important reason why lenders refuse to make loans. Nevertheless, how can we explain the low observed default rate? The most probable explanation seems to be that borrowers value the reputation of being creditworthy that results from repeated applications for credit and subsequent loan repayments. Monitoring may also be at work to reduce the default rate. Credit Constraints in Developing Countries The discussion of the theory of credit markets suggests that credit constraints should be important in developing countries. But in reality, how significant are they? How much do they impede economic development? A firm is credit constrained if it is unable to obtain all the credit it wants at the going interest rate. If a firm has a project that will generate a higher return than the market interest rate, it will want to invest in that project but may be prevented from doing so because of credit constraints. Credit-constrained firms will thus always have a marginal product of capital that is higher than the market interest rate. Remember that the marginal product of capital is the additional return from an additional unit of capital. The Difficulty of Measuring Credit Constraints It is difficult to identify empirically whether a firm is credit constrained. Information is needed on both the demand for credit by that firm and the supply of credit to the same firm in order to verify whether the demand for credit at the going interest rate exceeds the supply of credit. When demand is not satisfied, measuring demand is very challenging because it is not directly observed. How then do economists measure credit demand? Many surveys ask firms about their credit demand to see whether they would want to borrow more than what a bank might offer. However, these types of questions generally deliver unreliable answers. Firms might say they would like to borrow more but do not really have the serious intention to do so, as answering positively costs nothing. Survey answers could thus overestimate the extent of credit constraints. A survey might ask firms if they were turned down for credit and by how much. This seems to be a better way of gauging the seriousness of firms’ credit demand intentions. However, many firms might decide not to submit a credit application because they expect to be turned down. In this case, using this type of question to measure the extent of credit constraints could underestimate the true extent of credit constraints. Because using survey questions to measure credit constraints is not very reliable, researchers have developed other, more indirect methods. One procedure is to perform regressions of current investment on past profit. If the regression coefficient is positive and significant, this is seen as evidence of

Market Development They would all be better off if, as a group, they shared the costs of establishing the cooperative, but each individual farmer would be even better off if all participated except for him. The collective-action failure can thus be a very serious obstacle to the establishment of cooperatives and can present a significant obstacle to agricultural and economic progress in developing countries. A problem that often arises with marketing cooperatives is that those individuals who take a leadership position can hijack the cooperative and make it work for their own benefit. Cooperative leaders can keep a large part of the cooperative’s profits for themselves by diverting funds away from other members. Sometimes cooperatives are even transformed into the monopsonies that they were supposed to replace, paying a low price to members for their crops and selling them at a high price. In other words, an agency problem emerges within the cooperative when those who are supposed to serve the interests of all members instead serve only themselves. Agency problems are ubiquitous in any collective organization; they are inherent even in modern democracies when elected politicians abuse their power and serve themselves instead of their constituents. Addressing agency problems necessitates the establishment of rules within the cooperative that make the leadership accountable to the members and that enable members to replace leaders who violate those rules. This is often easier said than done. Because the collective-action problem often prevents the establishment of cooperatives, governments in various countries have implemented policies that encourage their creation. This has been the case in India for many decades. But while government support for cooperatives can help farmers, it can also create problems of its own. Cooperatives may spend time lobbying for subsidies or neglect the efficient management of their operating costs, with the expectation that in a worst-case scenario, they will be bailed out by government money. In other words, they may suffer from the problems of softbudget constraints. Many marketing cooperatives also play the role of credit cooperatives because they can rarely abstain from providing credit to their members. They not only help farmers market their output but also pool member resources to finance the purchase of supplies, or equipment by their members. Market Integration When analyzing markets, whether in developing or advanced countries, economists try to measure the degree of market integration . What do we mean by this term? Say that there is shortage of rice in region A but not in region B. If markets are only local and are not integrated, then there will be an increase in the price of rice in region A but not in region B. If markets are integrated, however, rice will be transported from region B to region A in order to satisfy demand. This means that the price will increase by a smaller amount in region A due to the additional supply, but it also means that the price will increase in region B. In general, when markets are perfectly integrated, assuming no transportation costs, the price for a product should be the same everywhere. If the price is higher in one region, then merchants will

The Role of Credit Markets in Development is higher than what the bank is willing to supply. Credit rationing occurs every day. Potential borrowers are always anxious that a bank may not approve their loan applications. Indeed, loan applications are routinely refused by banks. In contrast, this rationing does not generally happen on markets for goods. When someone enters a shop to buy a raincoat, it is rare that the merchant will refuse to sell the merchandise; it only happens if the raincoats are out of stock. However, credit rationing is in the best interests of a bank and it is the corollary of setting an interest rate at which not all demand can be satisfied. How broadly can we apply the reasoning we have used so far? Is it just a consequence of the particular numbers of our examples? The logic is, in fact, quite general. As soon as banks lack information about the quality of borrowers, the logic of our arguments will apply. Moral Hazard and Collateral Let us now turn to the case of moral hazard using the same example we discussed above. With adverse selection, some borrowers had safe projects and others had risky ones, but the bank had no information on who had which type of loan. With moral hazard, borrowers can choose between the safe and the risky project, and the bank cannot observe what choice they make. We have seen that if an entrepreneur has to borrow 100 to finance a project, he or she has an incentive to choose the risky project because limited liability acts as an insurance against failure. Indeed, the loan will not be repaid if the entrepreneur does not have the funds to do so. If every borrower chooses the risky project, the failure rate of those projects would be 50%, the probability of failure. The bank would thus have to charge an interest of 100 in order to break even. How can a bank mitigate moral hazard? The most obvious way is by taking collateral against the loan, assets that the borrower permits contractually to be seized in case the loan does not get repaid. If the borrower agrees to collateralize his or her assets to the full extent of the loan, it means that in case of failure, the bank has the right to seize the collateralized assets in order to recover the value of the loan, the interest on it, and any other possible fees that might be included. Take the case of an Indian farmer who can either invest in growing a safe or a risky type of crop. If his land is collateralized, the lender can seize the land in case of the farmer’s default. Collateral reduces the risk for the bank because it ensures that the loan will be paid back. It also changes the incentive of the borrower. Assume that the borrower has a collateral of 100 or more, say 110. With collateral, the borrower will prefer the safe project to the risky project. The safe project yields a net return of 150 110 = 40 with an interest rate of 10%. With the same interest rate, the risky project yields 0. (280 110) + 0. (0 110) = 85 55 = 30. The borrower now prefers to choose the safe project. Note that collateral aligns the interest of the borrower with that of social welfare: it induces the borrower to choose the project with the highest expected return. The use of collateral reduces the risks of lending in two ways. First, it mitigates the risk of the borrower defaulting on the loan because collateral works like an insurance policy that protects the bank from that risk. Second, it eliminates the borrower’s incentive to choose a risky project because of limited liability. Indeed, collateral presents a downside risk for the borrower that is absent under limited liability.

Market Development has a transport cost of 400 pesos. At a purchase price of 6 pesos and an output of 100, the merchant makes 400 pesos in operating profit but will barely break even because of the transport cost of 400 pesos. Assuming that two buyers have a 50% chance of purchasing the rice crop if they offer the same price to the farmer, each merchant would still have to make a profit of 400 pesos on the sale in order to break even. With a production level of 150, each merchant would have to make an operating profit of 5 1 3 pesos per unit of rice. Indeed, 0.5 * 150 * 5 1 3 = 400. As a result, each merchant could not afford to pay more than 10 pesos minus 5 1 3 pesos, which gives a maximum price of 4 2 3 pesos per unit of rice to the farmer. The farmer cannot make a profit with the new technology at that price. Indeed, taking the investment into account, his net profit is 150 * 4 2 3 150 * 2 400 = 100 pesos. At a production level of 100 with the old technology, each trader would have to make a profit of 8 pesos; that is, the traders could not afford to buy rice at more than the price of 2 pesos, which is clearly not profitable. Moreover, each buyer would have an incentive to undercut the other. In the long run, encouraging competition would seem to be the obvious way to solve the monopsony problem, but because only one buyer would remain to negotiate with the farmer, there would still be a stable monopsony as it would not be profitable to have more than one buyer make the trip to do business with the farmer. Marketing cooperatives. A third solution that can provide an alternative to the monopsony problem is to establish marketing cooperatives for farmers. There are numerous examples of these cooperatives in developing countries, from wool producers in Kyrgyzstan, to dairy farmers in South Asia and the Middle East, to beekeepers in Turkey. Marketing cooperatives exist for virtually every kind of agricultural product. For the purpose of our discussion, assume that if a farmer markets his own product, he has to pay the transport cost (400 pesos) himself, but he also loses time working on the farm because of the time spent in transporting his product. To make things simple, assume (unrealistically) that the farmer loses all his output if he has to make a trip to the market. Then, assume that the farmers in the area form a cooperative and take turns bringing all their output to market. How many farmers does it take to make adoption of the marketing cooperative profitable? If a single farmer’s output is sold directly on the market at the price of 10, the net profit to the farmer is 10 * 150 400 2 * 150 = 800. The cost to one farmer to sell on the market is lost profit (800) plus the transport cost 400 = 1200. In this example, it is too costly for a single farmer to market his product directly, but just two farmers working together would be enough to support a marketing cooperative. The total production profit per year would be 800 because one of the two farmers would forgo all his individual profits when transporting the output to the market. Even though the transport cost of 400 would have to be deducted from this total profit, each farmer would get half of the total profit (800 400 = 400), or 200. With more farmers belonging to the cooperative, the profit per farmer would increase. If a marketing cooperative can be profitable with just a few participating farmers, it seems as if it would be relatively easy to set one up. However, if larger numbers of participating farmers are needed, they may fail to establish the cooperative because of the collective-action failure.

Market Development the introduction of cell phones. 8 Niger, in West Africa, is one of the poorest nations in the world, with 85% of the population living on less than US$2 per day. Grain, primarily millet and sorghum, accounts for over 75% of the country’s food consumption. In a country that is roughly 3 times the size of California, grain is transported from remote farms to consumers by means of a complex system of grain markets that take place only once per week. Traditionally, traders had to travel long distances between farms and markets in order to obtain information on supply, demand, and current prices. Therefore, the communication of market information was quite slow. Between 2001 and 2006, however, cell phone service was phased in throughout Niger, providing grain traders and other market participants a fast, inexpensive technology for disseminating market information. The use of cell phones has improved communication speed and has led to a reduction in price dispersion as traders can now quickly learn local market conditions and then exploit arbitrage opportunities by transporting goods to those markets with the highest prices. Because cell phone service was established incrementally, it has been possible to estimate the effects of rapid communication on market integration. Price dispersion should be lower between markets for which cell phone service was established. Indeed, Aker found that the availability of cell phone service reduced grain price dispersion across markets by a minimum of 6. % and reduced intra-annual price variation by 10%. Because traders no longer need to travel to gather information, cell phones have had a greater impact on price dispersion between any two markets that are remote from each other, as well as for markets with poor transportation infrastructure. It is worth noting that improved communications can have significant positive impacts on the welfare of a developing nation’s population. In 2005, there was a localized food crisis in Niger, with acute grain shortages in certain regions. In areas where grain was in short supply, prices were 20% higher than in those regions with adequate supplies. At the time of the food crisis, only 24% of the markets in regions facing the possibility of famine had cell phone coverage, as compared to 83% of the markets in regions not facing famine. Cell phone coverage, by providing arbitrage opportunities for market traders, enabled the rapid transport of grain to many of those areas in crisis. Better market integration means that there are fewer instances of excess supply in some regions and excess demand in others. As market information circulates more rapidly, goods travel to those areas where there is more demand and prices are highest. Better market integration also leads to more price stability in individual regions because the movement of goods from lowprice to high-price markets tends to stabilize prices. All this is particularly important when there are localized food shortages. 8 Jenny C. Aker, “Information from Markets Near and Far: Mobile Phones and Agricultural Markets in Niger” American Economic Journal: Applied Economics 2, no. 3 (2010): 46-59.

It is worth noting that improved communications can have significant positive impacts on the welfare of a developing nation’s population. In 2005, there was a localized food crisis in Niger, with acute grain shortages in certain regions. In areas where grain was in short supply, prices were 20% higher than in those regions with adequate supplies. At the time of the food crisis, only 24% of the markets in regions facing the possibility of famine had cell phone coverage, as compared to 83% of the markets in regions not facing famine. Cell phone coverage, by providing arbitrage opportunities for market traders, enabled the rapid transport of grain to many of those areas in crisis. Better market integration means that there are fewer instances of excess supply in some regions and excess demand in others. As market information circulates more rapidly, goods travel to those areas where there is more demand and prices are highest. Better market integration also leads to more price stability in individual regions because the movement of goods from lowprice to high-price markets tends to stabilize prices. All this is particularly important when there are localized food shortages. 8 Jenny C.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development Call B the sum of the principal and the interest. The bank knows that 50% of projects are safe and they would pay back B. There are also 50% of projects that are risky and they would only pay back in 50% of the cases. In other words, the probability of the bank being paid back is only 50% plus 50% of 50%, or 75% in total. As a result, the bank recovers its money if the following equation holds: 0.75B = 100 S B = 100/ .75 = 133. . Thus, due to lack of information about the quality of the given projects and a 25% delinquency rate, the bank would have to charge an minimum interest rate of 33. % for all loans in order to get back 100% of its original investment. Assume now that at an interest rate of 33. %, there is excess demand for loans. In other words, the total demand for loans is higher than what the bank is able to lend. What happens if the lender charges a higher interest rate? We might think that this would increase the bank’s profits as long as the total demand for loans is higher than the supply of loans. This is the standard lesson we learn from traditional supply and demand analysis. If I am selling raincoats, I am better off increasing my price as long as I can sell all the raincoats I have in stock. Not so for banking! Increasing the interest rate can decrease the bank’s profits. As soon as the interest rate becomes higher than 50%, the demand for loans to fund the safe projects disappears and only the demand for the risky loans remain. Indeed, at an interest rate above 50%, the safe project would yield 150, but the entrepreneur would have to pay back more than 150. The safe project becomes unprofitable. The demand for risky projects would, however, still be present. Referring to the example we have used so far, the risky project yields 280 with 50% probability, and because the borrower must pay back 150, the expected net return becomes (280 150) = 130 times 50%, or 65. Recall that with 50% probability, the project yields zero and the borrower cannot pay back the loan. We can thus see that at an interest rate of 50%, borrowing for a safe project becomes unprofitable, while borrowing for a risky project remains profitable. In this case, an increase in the interest rate above 50% leads to adverse selection: the demand for safe loans disappears while the demand for risky loans remains. This is called adverse selection because it is the opposite of what we would want the market to do, which is finance the safe projects and not the risky ones. Increasing the interest rate above 50% decreases the expected profits of the bank. The bank would only be paid back half of the time instead of 75% of the time. In other words, the bank would now incur losses even though the interest rate is higher. An interest rate of 100% ( = 200 * 0. ) would then be necessary in order for the bank to break even. In this case, it would be better, for example, to charge an interest rate of 40% instead of an interest rate of, for example, 60%. With an interest rate of 40%, the bank would receive a return of 140 * 0.75 = 105. It would also make a profit of 5. With an interest rate of 60%, the probability of a borrower paying back a loan is only 50% because the only loans in demand are for the risky projects. In this situation, the bank gets back 160 * 0.5 = 80. The bank then incurs a loss because it lends 100 and is only paid back 80. Because low interest rates encourage a high demand for loans, a bank may decide to ration credit , that is, not satisfy all demand for credit if that demand

Market Development Lessons from the Effects of Transition on Market Development The lessons learned from the transition process on market development are quite important. The supply and demand framework familiar to economists assumes that markets exist, that there is information available about supply and demand, and that institutions exist to enforce transactions using legal precedents. However, the output fall in Central and Eastern Europe taught economists that making these standard assumptions in the context of emerging market economies can be a humbling experience. Are these lessons historically unique or do they have a more general application? They are, in fact, more general and are relevant beyond the transition experience for two reasons. First, they demonstrate that we cannot view markets as simple supply and demand adjustments. Solid institutional underpinnings are vital to markets. Second, problems similar to those observed in Central and Eastern Europe may occur in developing countries during periods of trade liberalization. Opening up to the world economy may lead to an inefficient disruption or destruction of domestic production chains. To what extent episodes of trade liberalization have led to an initial output fall that could have been avoided is a question that has yet to be the subject of much research. These new insights about the slow emergence of markets in transition economies and the disruptive effects of price liberalization without sufficient market development imply that developing countries may have to prepare themselves more thoroughly to absorb the shocks of trade liberalization. One way to accomplish this is to establish free-trade zones first and allow them to develop while simultaneously preparing the domestic economy for trade liberalization. As shown by Dani Rodrik, the island nation of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Madagascar, owes a large part of its economic success to the 1970 creation of an export-processing zone that specialized in garments exported primarily to Europe. 6 While Mauritius was establishing this export-processing zone, its domestic economy remained protected until the mid-1980s. As a result, the creation of the zone led to an economic expansion without domestic disruption. In particular, labor markets remained segmented, with different wage levels in the export-processing zone compared to the domestic economy. Mauritius has managed to implement a form of dual-track liberalization similar to what was done in China with domestic price liberalization: protecting the domestic economy while expanding the export-processing zone. Rural Markets and the Monopsony Problem Rural markets suffer from all the problems we have identified so far in this chapter: weak institutions, poverty, lack of communications technology, long distances, and high transportation costs. One particular problem that arises in 6 Dani Rodrik, “The New Global Economy and Developing Countries: Making Openness Work” ( policy paper, Overseas Development Council, distributed by Johns Hopkins University Press, Washington, DC, 1999).

Market Development prices that were an effect of the monopsony problem. 7 For example, in the case of palm oil, an edible vegetable oil, the Honduran government placed all oilcrushing mills in the control of one firm, Coapalma, that was able to earn enormous profits by paying monopsony prices for palm fruit. These were hold-up prices that only compensated growers for their yearly production costs and not for the investment cost of planting new trees, which discouraged farmers from planting new palm trees and expanding their oil-producing operations. Possible Solutions to the Monopsony Problem In developing economies, solving the monopsony problem is a key factor in improving productivity in agriculture, and its solution can also help to expand markets because increased productivity will lead to increased supply and multiple buyers, which in turn will lead to more competition and increased demand. What are some solutions to the monopsony problem? Long-term relationships. The first possible solution to the monopsony problem is the establishment of long-term business relationships between the farmer and the buyer. It does not completely solve the monopsony problem, but it does alleviate the bad behavior that is related to monopsony power. In fact, a buyer can also suffer from his own hold-up behavior if he has a long-term relationship with the farmer. He would be better off refraining from offering a lower price after the farmer has invested in productivity enhancements on his land because he stands to benefit in the long run from the higher output volume and sales—and the lower costs—that result from technological improvements introduced by the farmer once he knows he will not be subject to the holdup. It is, however, not clear that the buyer necessarily has an interest in the development of long-term relationships. He might be better off going from farmer to farmer offering to buy their products at a very low price. For example, if there is a weak institutional environment characterized by conflict, like a civil war, or weak legal and law enforcement institutions, then it might be difficult to sustain long-term relationships. When there is conflict or the threat of bandits, merchants might also be unable to depend on the regular use of roads between farms and markets. Competition. A second, more obvious solution to the monopsony problem would be to introduce competition. If a farmer were able to attract more than one buyer, he could use that competition to bid prices up and could then always sell to the highest bidder without confronting the hold-up problem. However, this is easier said than done. There might be various reasons that would make competition difficult to sustain. In particular, competition might not be feasible if it is not profitable for two buyers to go to the same village. Our numerical example can also illustrate the issues that affect competition. Assume that the buyer can sell the rice for 10 pesos per pound on the market. Recall that his purchase price was 6 pesos per pound. But also assume that he 7 Catherine de Fontenay, Institutions, Market Power, and the Big Push: The Case of Agro-Exports in Northern Honduras (Kensington, New South Wales: University of New South Wales, School of Economics, 1999).

Market Development axis represents the monthly number of deaths and the horizontal axis represents the log of real wages expressed in terms of quantities of rice. A strong negative relationship is apparent: the higher the wage, the lower the number of deaths. Note, however, that this negative relationship only occurs during a famine period. It appears that the poorest people who are already economically marginalized are the first to suffer famine when there is an adverse shock in the economy such as reduced food availability or higher food prices. A small drop in food consumption for the poorest can thus lead to famine. Even perfectly efficient markets cannot prevent famines if poor people do not have sufficient purchasing power to acquire enough food to survive. Simple expectations of future price increases for food may lead to hoarding behavior, the effect of which is actual price increases that leave the poor vulnerable to starvation. However, famines most often occur when markets are functioning imperfectly. Breakdowns in transportation systems prevent food from reaching the regions most threatened by starvation. High inventories of food in some areas can coincide with starvation in others, and lack of market integration due to the causes we have previously identified (poor communication and transportation infrastructures, regulatory barriers) may lead to famines that could otherwise be prevented if there were better market integration. As we see, famines are not necessarily only the results of droughts, floods or wars; they can occur due to economic marginalization of the most vulnerable and poor citizens and because of failures in market integration. Famines and Democracy Another very important fact highlighted by Sen is that famines do not occur in democracies, but are common in countries governed by various forms of autocracies or dictatorships. This is a very significant fact. We cannot find a single example of a famine occurring in a democratic system with a relatively free press. Famines have occurred under colonial rule, as in India or Ireland under British control in the 19th and 20th centuries, in Communist regimes such as in China, the Soviet Union, Cambodia, or North Korea. In a healthy democracy with a free press, whenever natural disasters strike or food shortages occur, the government always mounts an emergency response that manages to avoid famine. While a democracy with a robust free press forces its leaders to respond to famine situations, a dictatorship does not have a free press, and it often makes a greater effort to repress information about a famine. One of the most recent examples of famine occurring under a dictatorship happened in the late 1990s in North Korea, one of the world’s last remaining Communist regimes. Under the autocratic rule of Kim Il Sung and that of his son, Kim Jong Il, the country consistently suffered from an inefficient centrally planned economy, but the economic situation became grave in the early 1990s. The regime had been heavily subsidized by the Soviet Union, but following the The North Korean Famine

Market Development Does this mean that markets by themselves prevent famines? The issue of markets and famines, as well as the cause of famines in general, is a very important factor in market development and one to which we now turn. Famines There have been many instances of famine in modern history. China had a very severe and wide-ranging famine from 1959 to 1961, when more than fifteen million people were estimated to have died. Earlier in the century, from 1943 to 1944, there was a massive famine in Bengal, a region in the northeast of the Indian subcontinent, at that time still under British rule, during which more than three million people died. Famine occurred in Biafra as a result of its secession from Nigeria and the resulting civil war in the late 1960s. From 1983 to 1985, there was a famine in Ethiopia that affected more than 8 million people, with 1 million deaths. It is no surprise that famines occur in the poorest countries. Some of the worst famines of the 20th century have, however, been associated with Communist regimes and with disastrous agricultural policies that resulted in millions of deaths. Consider, for example, the collectivization of agriculture in the Ukraine under Joseph Stalin in the early 1930s in combination with his policy of deporting thousands of Ukrainians to prison camps, and his deliberate starvation of those who remained; the dictator Pol Pot’s mass deportation of Cambodia’s urban population to the “killing fields” of the countryside from 1975 to 1979 where those who survived mass executions were left to starve to death; and China’s “Great Leap Forward” in 1959, a disastrous attempt by Communist leaders to rapidly transform the country’s ancient agrarian society into a modern industrial nation. Peasants were forced to produce steel in their backyards while agricultural production was neglected. The resulting fall in agricultural output led millions to starve to death. As we will see, there is a clear association between famines and the absence of democracy. Famine occurs when there is a particularly high mortality risk that results from a significant reduction in food supplies for at least some groups of people in a geographic area. A famine does not have to be associated with a reduction in aggregate availability of food in a country or even in a region; rather, the criterion is whether some groups of people at some point in time lack access to food supplies in a way that threatens their lives. Groups that are at risk of suffering from famine are those that are politically and socially more vulnerable and weak. Amartya Sen’s Analysis of Famine Born in Bengal in 1933, economist Amartya Sen experienced the 1943 Bengali famine firsthand when he was young. In 1981, he developed an innovative approach to the analysis of famine and was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998. According to Sen, people die in famines not because there is not enough food for everybody, but because of the inequalities in the entitlements to food that are themselves related to a country’s formal institutions. The central concept in Sen’s analysis of famines is that of an individual’s entitlement set , which is defined as all the goods that an individual 


Market Development immediately rush there to supply additional quantities at the higher price until prices are equalized. Now, if we allow for transportation costs, prices will not necessarily be the same everywhere because these costs vary from region to region; however, price variations will be the same. Indeed, look again at the example of the two regions. Suppose there is a shortage of rice in region A but not in region B. Traders will move rice from region B to region A up to the point where the advantage of selling in region B or transporting rice to region A and incurring the transport costs are equal. The point here is that prices in region B will increase following the price increase in region A; as rice moves out of region B to region A, the supply of rice in region B is reduced, thereby leading to an equivalent increase in price in region B as well. Measures of market integration that economic researchers have devised aim precisely at capturing to what extent prices for the same goods move in the same direction at the same time. If this simultaneous movement is present, we can say that markets are integrated. If, on the other hand, prices in different regions do not move in the same direction at a specific moment in time, this can be seen as evidence that markets are not integrated. The methods researchers use to measure this integration are quite technical and we will not analyze them in depth. However, the general principle is to test whether prices of the same or similar goods are moving in the same direction at the same time across different regions. Lack of integration or insufficient integration may be due to several different factors. For example, lack of communication and transportation infrastructures can impact market integration. Without adequate communication technologies, traders in region B may not be aware of shortages in region A; as a result, there will be no market reaction to those shortages and merchants will not take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities that emerge. Transportation difficulties can also affect integration if it is very difficult to move goods between regions, either because of geographical factors (distance, terrain, etc.) or lack of infrastructure (roads, bridges, trains). There may, however, also be obstacles to integration that are the result of government regulations. We will look at these different obstacles in turn. Communication Obstacles to Market Integration In modern markets, communication is a key factor in integration. In financial markets, trades are made continuously on a 24-hour cycle. Any information on world events (an earthquake in Asia, poor returns for a global enterprise, a war that flares within or between nations) is instantaneously transmitted to the world’s financial markets where this information is then reflected in prices. Global markets for commodities function in a similar way. Physically, most of these markets are located in the wealthiest cities in the world: New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Tokyo. In the poorest regions of the world, however, communication is much slower, with the result that markets do not respond as quickly to changing conditions as they do in the developed world. A good example of the effects of communication technologies is a study done by Jenny Aker on integration in Niger’s grain market before and after 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development remains in his firm. In case he cannot pay back the loan, limited liability makes it impossible to extract any payment from him. The bank cannot seize his private assets or force him to work extra to pay back the loan. 4 If the tailor does not pay back the loan in the bad state, this induces him to prefer the risky project over the safe one. The bank would obviously prefer the tailor to choose the safe project because he will then pay back the loan with 100% probability. From the point of view of society, or social welfare, it would also be better if the tailor were to choose the safe project because the total return to both the tailor and the bank is then higher. We thus conclude from this example that when an agent borrows and has limited liability, he may have an incentive to choose a risky project over a safe one and this may be bad from the point of view of social welfare. This example also helps us to distinguish between adverse selection and moral hazard concepts. Adverse selection arises when a bank faces loan demands for both safe and risky projects, and has no information about the quality or risk of the individual projects. Adverse selection means that when interest rates rise, entrepreneurs with safe projects stop asking for loans so that the bank only faces risky projects. Moral hazard arises when the bank cannot observe the choices borrowers make between safe and risky projects. Moral hazard means that the borrower will likely choose the risky project with its possibility of higher returns, whereas the bank would prefer the borrower choose the safe project. Note that the example above is formulated as a case of moral hazard. Moral hazard in the lending relationship does not mean that the borrower will always choose a risky project with a higher expected return over a safe project. The borrower may, for example, engage in an unobserved level of effort and this choice may affect the probability of the expected returns. If, in the example discussed above, the tailor chooses to put low effort into the risky project, it would yield 280 with 50% probability and zero with 50% probability. If, instead, he chooses a high level of effort, then the project would yield 280 with 80% probability and zero with 20% probability. Adverse Selection and Credit Rationing Let us first discuss the case of adverse selection. Assume that 50% of entrepreneurs have a risky project (280 return with 50% probability and zero return with 50% probability) and the other 50% have a safe project (150 with 100% probability). Assume that a bank knows the types of projects and their proportions, but does not know which borrower has a safe or a risky project. If the bank did have this information, it would only lend to those borrowers with safe projects. When the bank considers making a loan, a firm’s project could thus be either risky (with 50% probability) or safe (with 50% probability). How much would the bank have to charge in interest so as not to lose money, that is, in order to realize a loan repayment of 100? 4 Note that even when there are no limited liability laws in developing countries, small entrepreneurs in urban areas can find ways to run away from their obligations to a bank and reemerge elsewhere in a city and go on with their lives. By doing so, they shield themselves from the downside aspects of risky projects. 


Market Development Does this mean that markets by themselves prevent famines? The issue of markets and famines, as well as the cause of famines in general, is a very important factor in market development and one to which we now turn. Famines There have been many instances of famine in modern history. China had a very severe and wide-ranging famine from 1959 to 1961, when more than fifteen million people were estimated to have died. Earlier in the century, from 1943 to 1944, there was a massive famine in Bengal, a region in the northeast of the Indian subcontinent, at that time still under British rule, during which more than three million people died. Famine occurred in Biafra as a result of its secession from Nigeria and the resulting civil war in the late 1960s. From 1983 to 1985, there was a famine in Ethiopia that affected more than 8 million people, with 1 million deaths. It is no surprise that famines occur in the poorest countries. Some of the worst famines of the 20th century have, however, been associated with Communist regimes and with disastrous agricultural policies that resulted in millions of deaths. Consider, for example, the collectivization of agriculture in the Ukraine under Joseph Stalin in the early 1930s in combination with his policy of deporting thousands of Ukrainians to prison camps, and his deliberate starvation of those who remained; the dictator Pol Pot’s mass deportation of Cambodia’s urban population to the “killing fields” of the countryside from 1975 to 1979 where those who survived mass executions were left to starve to death; and China’s “Great Leap Forward” in 1959, a disastrous attempt by Communist leaders to rapidly transform the country’s ancient agrarian society into a modern industrial nation. Peasants were forced to produce steel in their backyards while agricultural production was neglected. The resulting fall in agricultural output led millions to starve to death. As we will see, there is a clear association between famines and the absence of democracy. Famine occurs when there is a particularly high mortality risk that results from a significant reduction in food supplies for at least some groups of people in a geographic area. A famine does not have to be associated with a reduction in aggregate availability of food in a country or even in a region; rather, the criterion is whether some groups of people at some point in time lack access to food supplies in a way that threatens their lives. Groups that are at risk of suffering from famine are those that are politically and socially more vulnerable and weak. Amartya Sen’s Analysis of Famine Born in Bengal in 1933, economist Amartya Sen experienced the 1943 Bengali famine firsthand when he was young. In 1981, he developed an innovative approach to the analysis of famine and was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998. According to Sen, people die in famines not because there is not enough food for everybody, but because of the inequalities in the entitlements to food that are themselves related to a country’s formal institutions. The central concept in Sen’s analysis of famines is that of an individual’s entitlement set , which is defined as all the goods that an individual 


Market Development many rural markets is the monopsony problem. This is a word that you certainly have heard less than the word “monopoly.” While monopoly refers to a commodity controlled by a single producer, a monopsony occurs when a given market is controlled by a single buyer. Monopsonies are rarer than monopolies, but they are frequently found in the markets of developing countries. In regions where farmers are poor and work on small plots of land far from city markets, how do they sell their farm output? In many cases, the simple answer is that they do not. Much of the farming that takes place in Africa is subsistence farming. In other words, farmers work small land holdings to feed themselves and their families but do not commercialize the extra output produced because of the expense, or are unable to because of the size limitations of their lands. What does this have to do with the monopsony problem? When farmers do want to grow beyond subsistence farming, increase the size and productivity of their land, and make sufficient money to improve the economic situation of their families, they are faced with the difficult problem of how to sell their agricultural output. It is often too costly for individual farmers to go to a city market, sometimes hundreds of miles away, to sell their crops without a means of transport, such as a small truck. At best, they can only sell to a trader who will come to them. Rarely will more than one trader make an offer on their crops and provide them with the opportunity to sell to the highest bidder. These farmers will thus face a monopsonist, a single buyer who controls the market for their output. Because the trader will propose to buy a farmer’s output at a very low price, the single low offer is enough to discourage farmers from making any investment that would increase the productivity of their land. Let us see why. Monopsony and the Hold-Up Problem In order to understand the monopsony problem better, we can work with a numeric example. Imagine an individual farmer who can choose between two technologies: a low-level technology with costs only for labor, and a new, more productive technology requiring a fixed investment. Suppose the farmer can produce 100 pounds of rice at a cost of 5 pesos per pound with the old, lowlevel technology. Assume that the cost per pound represents the total manual labor put into working the land and harvesting the crop. This is how the farmer has always worked. Suppose that with the new technology, the farmer can produce 150 pounds of rice at a cost of 2 pesos per pound, but only after having made an investment that costs 400 pesos on an annual basis for fertilizer, modern seeds, an irrigation system, tools, and a harvesting machine. Suppose that the farmer sells his rice to a merchant who is a monopsonist, the only person who ever shows up in the village and offers to buy agricultural products. Because all other markets are distant, it is very costly for the farmer to sell the rice himself so he is pleased to get at least some income from selling his surplus rice without having to solve the difficult and timeconsuming problem of transporting it to another market. However, the monopsony can be an obstacle to investing in the new technology. Suppose that the initial price the farmer can get from the monopsonist is 6 pesos. Under the old technology, the farmer makes a profit of 6 * 100 5 * 100 = 100 pesos. At the price of 6 pesos, would the farmer prefer to invest in the new technology? If the farmer does make the investment in the new technology, he would

However, the monopsony can be an obstacle to investing in the new technology. Suppose that the initial price the farmer can get from the monopsonist is 6 pesos. Under the old technology, the farmer makes a profit of 6 * 100 5 * 100 = 100 pesos. At the price of 6 pesos, would the farmer prefer to invest in the new technology? If the farmer does make the investment in the new technology, he would 


Market Development make a profit of 6 * 150 400 2 * 150 = 200 pesos, which is a higher return. Recall that we assume under the new technology that the farmer can produce 150 pounds at a unit cost of 2 pesos and a fixed cost of 400 pesos. This sounds like good news—at the price of 6 pesos, the farmer makes a profit of 100 pesos under the old technology and a profit of 200 pesos under the new technology. The farmer will thus have an interest in investing in the new technology at that price. Does the farmer need to worry about a possible price change? Yes, he certainly does. Suppose that after the farmer has invested in the new technology, the merchant tells him that now he is only willing to pay a price of 3 pesos per unit of rice. Does this remind you of something? It is the hold-up problem. The merchant will try to force the farmer to accept the lower price by exploiting the fact that he has already made the technology investment. The farmer will still want to produce if the price is 3 pesos; because the investment is a sunk cost—it no longer enters his calculations. At a price of 3 pesos, the farmer thus makes an operating profit of 3 * 150 2 * 150 = 150 pesos. Note that at the price of 3 pesos under the old technology, the farmer would have incurred losses and thus would not have invested in the new technology. The merchant is tempted to lower the price from 6 to 3 pesos once the farmer has made the investment in the new technology because he knows the farmer will agree to sell at a price of 3 pesos. The possibility of the hold-up problem is, however, the cause of a very serious economic disincentive. Before making the investment in the new technology, the farmer will consider the possibility that the merchant may hold him up at a later stage. If the merchant cannot commit to not lowering the price, the farmer will prefer to stick to the old technology and not take the risk of investing in the new technology and be worse off because of the hold-up problem. Indeed, the total operating profit of 150 when the price is 3 pesos would not compensate for the investment of 400. Note that monopsony is at the heart of the hold-up problem here. If the farmer had the possibility of selling his rice to another competing merchant, he could sell it at a higher price and enjoy the benefits of his investment, but the existence of the monopsony makes that impossible. Therefore, it is not profitable to invest in new technology and improve the land’s productivity, and this creates a very serious problem for developing economies. Monopsonies in Developing Countries Monopsonies are common in many regions of Africa where the distances between producers and markets are large and population density is low. They are also present in other continents such as Asia, for example, where rice is often purchased by owners of rice mills who act as local monopsonists. Many vegetable markets in Indonesia are ruled by monopsonies that in many cases have even been encouraged by the government. In South America, the Honduran government tried to create a large agro-food industry by investing in large processing plants and encouraging farmers to switch to crops for exports. However, the firms buying the crops were monopsonists and, as a result, the farmers failed to make the investments expected from them because of the low

Market Development can obtain with the resources he or she commands, given the laws of his or her society. According to Sen, starvation is the result of an entitlement failure that occurs when social norms and laws in a society are such that in the case of a food shortage, some individuals are “left out” to starve. In situations of famine, there may be enough food to prevent any single individual from starving, but some categories of the population may witness a fall in income that does not allow them to acquire enough food to survive. If there is a food shortage, the distribution of food in poor families may be sufficiently unequal that the poorest members of the family (usually the elderly and female family members) starve while the other family members do not. Markets may be insufficiently integrated so that they cannot remedy negative shocks to a local food supply. Government emergency distribution funds may not work appropriately. While aggregate drops in food availability may trigger famines, they are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for famines to occur. Indeed, many famines occur without even a decline in aggregate food availability. Moreover, there are cases in which food availability declines substantially, but no one starves.

Roughly 95% of transportation between Xinjiang and China’s other provinces relies on this railroad as distances between them are long, roads are poor, and the mountainous and desert terrains are challenging. Until 1994, because there was just a single track, only one train at a time could travel on this 1200-mile stretch, severely restricting the transportation of goods. Since 1994, with the addition of a second track, there has been a substantial increase in transportation capacity. Figure 4 analyzes the price gap for four types of commodities shipped from Urumqi to Lanzhou: gasoline, diesel, and cold- and hot-rolled thin sheet steel. As is evident in the figure, after 1994 and the completion of the second track, there is a significant drop in the price gap for all four goods. These figures by themselves do not prove that the transportation investment had a major effect on reducing the price differential.

Market Development collapse of Communism and the breakup of the USSR in 1991, Russia suspended its assistance to North Korea. Thereafter, the regime decided to reduce grain rations to the population. The government launched an “eat only two meals per day” campaign and, by 1993, there were rumors of food riots. In 1994, rations were further cut, officially to 400-450 grams of grain per person, but according to refugees, rations may have been as low as 150 grams per person. As rations steadily grew smaller, the government organized campaigns to seize grain in the countryside. Rural households responded by hoarding, reducing grain production on the land they farmed collectively, and intensifying production on their own private plots. As a result, the food supply became even scarcer. Fuel shortages and deficiencies in the country’s transportation infrastructure exacerbated the crisis. Famine began to occur in many regions, while others were unaffected. Food supplies, including international food aid, began to appear on black markets. Only those able to pay high prices could purchase the additional food necessary to prevent starvation. Following a series of floods in 1995 and then a drought in 1996 that brought the agricultural system to its knees, an extreme famine occurred from 1996 to 1999. As many as 600,000 people may have died from starvation. More than 3 million people may have been impacted in some way by the famine. While the North Korean regime has consistently denied the famine, it clearly is unable to feed its citizens and its reliance on external aid continues to increase. North Korea’s famine resulted from an aggregate drop in agricultural output caused by loss of aid from Russia and by a series of floods and drought. It was, however, exacerbated by other elements: ( ) entitlement failures resulted in many citizens becoming too poor to afford the minimum level of food; ( ) the failure of market integration, as food did not circulate freely to those areas where shortages were the most acute; and ( ) a dictatorial and oppressive regime with no accountability to its citizens. Chapter Summary Institutions and Market Development We have analyzed the interaction between institutions and market development. Markets develop as transaction costs decrease. Informational and commitment problems associated with transactions are important for market development. In poor countries, formal institutions provide little assistance to market development; market participants have fewer reasons to use courts to resolve contractual disputes because the monetary stakes in a transaction are usually lower than the cost of legal remedies and contracts are often verbal, making judicial verification more difficult. Moreover, there are significant problems related to transport and communication infrastructure. Given the weakness of formal institutions in developing nations, business networks play an important role in market development, and relational contracting that involves long-term business relationships is ubiquitous. The Emergence of Markets in Transition Countries When prices were liberalized in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism, economists thought that markets would develop smoothly. However, there was a large initial output fall after price liberalization because of the absence of preexisting market institutions that could have compensated for the disruption of existing production chains. Only China managed to avoid the output fall because of its dual-track liberalization system, keeping existing production plans at a predetermined level and encouraging enterprises to market any output above the planned level.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries gives us the numbers of teacher absenteeism by country. Note the high rate in India and Uganda. In none of the countries in Table 6 is the absence rate lower than 10%. Absenteeism rates tend to be higher in poorer regions. Headmasters often have higher absenteeism rates than teachers, which makes it impossible for them to supervise their teachers. Absenteeism is not the only form of shirking; minimal effort in educating children as well as social prejudice can also play important roles. Teachers who come from a higher social background tend to look down on the children in their classes who come from poorer families. Bad teacher behavior can also go to the extreme of outright extortion of pupils’ families; there are cases of teachers who threaten to flunk a child unless the parents pay them bribes, extorting money for fair grading. Other teachers may pressure parents to pay for private tutoring. The Returns to Education in Developing Countries One of the main concepts used to determine the economic effects of education is that of the returns to education . According to the economic theory of human capital, education is similar to an investment except that it is a very special sort of investment, an investment in one’s own human capital. Figure 3 helps us to understand this theory. The horizontal axis measures age but also time. As the old saying goes, “time is money”: no one wants to waste their time. The vertical axis measures earnings. Negative earnings represent the costs of education.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries of some economic agents on the welfare of other economic agents who were not involved in those choices. In the case of education, individuals’ education choices have positive externalities on others. Let us take a few examples. Imagine an Indian village whose inhabitants are illiterate. If the children in the village have access to education and learn to read and write, they can read newspapers and books to other village members or they can write letters for them. If someone in the village ultimately learns to be an engineer, then that person will be better equipped to provide all sorts of technological improvements to his or her community. Externalities of investment in education can be very important and this is certainly true in advanced economies. Take the example of Silicon Valley. By talking to each other a lot and exchanging information, Internet-era innovators came up with brilliant ideas, with the result that a culture has developed in the Silicon Valley of sharing ideas and projects. People go from one firm to the other just like bees pollinating flowers. One reason why there are many externalities from human capital is that better-educated people can share their good ideas with others and still keep those ideas; in other words, one individual’s use of an idea does not prevent others from also using it. In economics terms, ideas are nonrival goods: an individual can still use ideas when sharing them or even selling them to others. Normal goods like cars are, instead, called rival goods. Why do children from educated families often do better in school than children from less-educated families? They benefit from the conversations with their educated parents, who transmit their knowledge during family conversations, be it at the dinner table or in the car. The parents’ education has positive externalities on their children. In Figure 3, the shaded area above curve h 2 shows the positive externalities that result from education. Why do externalities matter? The main reason is that the total benefits from investment in human capital are higher than the private benefits. When an individual makes a choice of whether or not to invest in education, that individual only takes into account the private benefits and costs, but not the effects of externalities on others. This means that individual decisions to invest in education will lead to underinvestment from the point of view of society. Imagine an individual whose costs of investing in education are slightly above the expected benefits. The individual will thus rationally choose not to invest in education. However, if we add the externalities, then the expected benefits would outweigh the costs and it would be better from the point of view of society if that individual would decide to invest in education. This is very important in the development context, where education can play an important role aiding countries to grow out of poverty. The Role of Government in Education The solution to individual underinvestment in education is government investment in education. Ideally, if a government could figure out exactly the externalities of an individual’s education investment, it could subsidize that individual for the amount of those externalities. Then, all individuals would make the right education decision from the point of view of social welfare. In reality, this is not possible, but public subsidization of education investments

Market Development Transportation Obstacles to Market Integration We know that better communication enhances market integration as information circulates faster and more efficiently. However, improved information circulation is offset when goods cannot be transported easily between different regional markets. What effect can better transportation infrastructure have on market integration? An interesting study by Zhigang Li analyzed the effect on market integration of a large investment in railroad infrastructure improvements in China. 9 Before 1994, transportation between China’s western Xinjiang province and its eastern provinces depended on a one-track railroad between the city of Lanzhou (LAN in Figure 3), the capital of Gansu province, and the city of Urumqi 9 Zhigang Li, “Measuring the Social Return to Infrastructure Investments Using Interregional Price Gaps: A Natural Experiment (working paper, University of Hong Kong, 2005). FIGURE 3 Map of China and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railroad The Lanzhou-Xingjiang railroad connects Lanzhou (LAN on the map) to Urumqi (WU on the map).

Market Development also have been at work, such as a reduction in government regulations or variations in economic conditions that had nothing to do with the investment. However, Li shows that for similar goods transported between other regions of China, there was no such reduction in the price gap. The doubling of the railroad track thus had the effect of substantially reducing the price gap between Xinjiang and the rest of China, and the study demonstrates that transportation investment contributed both to an increased and more rapid flow of goods between different geographical regions, and to the reduction of price differentials across those regions. Regulatory Obstacles to Market Integration During the mid-1980s, some Chinese provinces liberalized their market prices earlier than others. Suppose that some provinces liberalized the price of grain while other provinces maintained price-control policies for grain to keep the price lower. Farmers who had the right to sell their grain freely would have wanted to export it to those provinces where the liberalized price was higher. However, the initial reaction of local authorities in the provinces with price controls was to erect trade barriers that prevented the export of grain to other regions. In fact, export barriers were established in various Chinese provinces for a variety of goods during the 1980s and even the early 1990s. 10 Later, however, officials removed these export barriers and made significant progress toward market integration across all of China. Li looked systematically at price differentials for 50 industrial goods in 36 major cities between 1992 and 2005. 11 The goods he considered were generally homogeneous (i.e., not diversified) and thus comparable, such as aluminum, cement, coal, caustic soda, copper, lead, polystyrene, rubber, sodium carbonate, and zinc, and the prices for each good across regions can thus be considered comparable. Figure 5 illustrates the evolution of median price differentials for cement and aluminum. We can see a decline in the differential for cement prices and a stable price differential for aluminum. This suggests a decline in trade barriers for cement but not for aluminum. Li found that the primary variable for price differentials was transportation costs, which is consistent with high market integration. When markets are very integrated, goods should have the same price, exclusive of transportation costs. These costs should explain any difference in prices. The study also suggested that local protectionism did not play a significant role in explaining price differentials across China. Overall, the evidence shows that China has experienced significant progress in market integration during recent decades and that local barriers to trade across regions have been significantly reduced or abolished. India has had a long history of regulatory barriers to internal trade that have resulted in a negative effect on market integration.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries In India, nearly 100% of children are now enrolled in primary education. This reflects significant efforts by the Indian government to provide the country’s 400 million poor children access to education. Despite these impressive numbers, illiteracy is still a large problem and roughly one out of three Indian children cannot read after attending primary school. A survey of schools in Mumbai in 2000 showed that 25% of children in grades 3 and 4 could not recognize letters and 35% could not recognize basic numbers. Teachers go formally through the curriculum and all children pass to the next grade, regardless of how well they master the material. As a result, many children fall behind and never acquire basic competencies. In 2001, the Indian NGO, Pratham, which dedicates its efforts to improving education in that country, decided to establish a remedial program for children who were falling behind in school. Pratham provided tutors to children in grades 2, 3, and 4 who had not mastered the basic skills of grades 1 and 2, such as the ability to spell simple words, read a paragraph, recognize a number, count to 20, or perform single digit addition or subtraction. These children were pulled out of their regular classes and put in remedial classes consisting of 20 pupils each. The tutors, typically young women, were hired from the local community at a salary equivalent to $10-$15 per month, representing less than 10% of a regular teacher’s salary. The tutors were required to have finished their secondary education and they received 2 weeks of additional training for the remedial program. The program significantly improved the basic competencies of the children in remedial classes (by 27. % for reading comprehension and by 68% for single-column addition problems) and substantially improved overall test scores (by 8% to 13%) in schools that implemented the remedial program. The program proved extremely cost effective, with costs estimated at $ .25 per student per year compared to an average per student education cost of $78 per year. 1 T his remedial program is one of many designed to improve education in developing countries and we can estimate its effects with a good degree of precision thanks to randomized evaluations done by development economists. The schools in which the pilot program was introduced were chosen randomly, making it possible to draw meaningful comparisons of its effects with schools where it had not been introduced. In this chapter, we will describe many of the studies done on programs to improve education. We start by documenting the education gap between 1 To find out more about Pratham’s remedial programs, go to MIT’s poverty action lab website at: http://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/publications/ 26_Policy_Briefcase_ .pdf.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries will lead more people to invest in education. In Figure 3, the shaded rectangle c 2 represents government expenditures that subsidize part of the cost of education. Externalities are not the only reason governments want to play a prominent role in the provision of education services. Poor families are credit constrained and generally unable to cover the costs of education. In advanced economies, education of the poor is usually not financed by credit markets, so it is unreasonable to expect those markets to play a role financing education in poor countries. Despite substantial government involvement in education in developing countries, there are often significant private costs involved as well, whether in the form of school fees, uniforms, or textbooks. These costs can be quite burdensome for poor families. Empirical Estimates of the Returns to Education What do we know about the returns to education in developing economies? Estimating these returns is not as straightforward as we might think. Ideally, we would like to compare two individuals, each of whom was randomly assigned to receive education (primary, secondary, or tertiary) and then compare the earnings profiles of the two. In reality, as we would expect from the theory of human capital explained above, investments in education are the result of individual and family choices. Take two people who can choose whether or not to go to university and assume that the costs are the same for both. If one of the two decides to go and not the other, presumably the former has a higher expected return to education than the latter. A comparison of their earnings profile later in life is likely to exaggerate the return to education because the one who chose to invest had a higher expected return than the one who chose not to invest. In other words, there is a selection effect. This would give a toooptimistic view of the returns to education, one that is biased upward. Those who choose to invest in education are likely to come from richer families that are not credit constrained, from better-educated families (the positive externalities within the families we mentioned earlier), or they could also belong to communities in which people are more educated and intellectual activities are more valued. In sum, there are many reasons why those who choose to pursue more education differ from those who do not. In the past, economists did not pay too much attention to these problems. Researchers who wanted to get an estimate of the returns to education in developing countries would typically do regressions of wages on years of schooling and these traditional studies would usually find very high rates of return. The estimated rates of return to primary, secondary, and tertiary (higher) education were typically around 26%, 20%, and 26%, respectively, for low-income countries (27. %, 18%, and 19. %, respectively, for middle-income countries). These numbers are higher than for high-income countries, where rates of return of 12% were typically found for secondary and tertiary education (given that 100% of people go through primary education in high-income countries, we have no estimates of the returns to primary education in those countries). There are reasons to be skeptical of these numbers because of the sample selection problem mentioned above. This is a serious issue: we would 


Delivering Education in Developing Countries will lead more people to invest in education. In Figure 3, the shaded rectangle c 2 represents government expenditures that subsidize part of the cost of education. Externalities are not the only reason governments want to play a prominent role in the provision of education services. Poor families are credit constrained and generally unable to cover the costs of education. In advanced economies, education of the poor is usually not financed by credit markets, so it is unreasonable to expect those markets to play a role financing education in poor countries. Despite substantial government involvement in education in developing countries, there are often significant private costs involved as well, whether in the form of school fees, uniforms, or textbooks. These costs can be quite burdensome for poor families. Empirical Estimates of the Returns to Education What do we know about the returns to education in developing economies? Estimating these returns is not as straightforward as we might think. Ideally, we would like to compare two individuals, each of whom was randomly assigned to receive education (primary, secondary, or tertiary) and then compare the earnings profiles of the two. In reality, as we would expect from the theory of human capital explained above, investments in education are the result of individual and family choices. Take two people who can choose whether or not to go to university and assume that the costs are the same for both. If one of the two decides to go and not the other, presumably the former has a higher expected return to education than the latter. A comparison of their earnings profile later in life is likely to exaggerate the return to education because the one who chose to invest had a higher expected return than the one who chose not to invest.

Market Development standards for goods have actually prevented internal trade, while cumbersome systems of multiple licensing requirements have hindered market entry and integration. If merchants need a license in one state to purchase certain goods, they will need another license in another state to sell those same goods. An extremely inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy discourages entrepreneurs from obtaining the necessary licenses, while regulations establishing price controls also prevent market integration by deterring traders from selling their goods in those areas with price controls, encouraging them instead to sell their good in other regions where there are no price controls. Moreover, goods crossing borders between different Indian states are subject to taxation. The reason that regulatory intervention frequently prevents market integration is not that governments are, per se , against it; rather, it has more to do with a government’s response to internal pressures that, in turn, result in obstacles to market integration. Say that the price of rice increases in a developing country, as happened in many countries in 2008. The poorest people might then be on the brink of starvation, and if famine breaks out, the result could be food riots. In these situations, a government’s response is often to establish price controls to avert the threat of famine and civil unrest. Because controlled prices tend to be lower than market prices, not only will there be excess demand, or shortages, but traders will try to move merchandise to those regions where prices are higher and where there are no price controls, and this will exacerbate the shortages. The government will then feel forced to intervene and prevent goods from moving away from areas of price control, thereby creating obstacles to market integration. The price differential for cement declined while the price differential for aluminum remained stable when trade barriers between Chinese provinces were removed in the early 1990s.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries for a number of years. Going to work immediately has a payoff indicated by curve h 1 in Figure 3. An individual starts earning immediately and those earnings tend to rise with age following a concave curve. Earnings rise with age because people become more experienced at what they are doing. The choice of investing in human capital instead involves two components: a cost and an earnings profile. The cost is represented by c 2 in the negative part of the vertical axis. The earnings profile is represented by h 2 , which has two properties compared to h 1 . First, it starts taking positive values at a later age: people start earning money only after they finish their education. Second, once positive earnings kick in, they are higher than if the individual did not invest in human capital. When comparing the choice of investing in human capital instead of going to work immediately, we must thus take into account one benefit and two costs. The benefit is higher earnings. This is the area labeled “private benefits” in Figure 3 above h 1 and below h 2 . The first cost is the cost of education c 2 . The second cost is foregone earnings. During the period when the individual is investing in education, he or she foregoes potential earnings. The theory of human capital says that people will invest in human capital if the expected benefit in lifetime earnings exceeds the cost of education and the cost of foregone earnings. In Figure 3, the benefit is higher than the costs. Externalities of Education Comparing the private benefits and costs of investing in human capital is not the whole story. There are also externalities of investment in human capital that we must take into account. Externalities are the effects of economic choices FIGURE 3 Investment in Human Capital and the Returns to Education h 2 c 2 h 1 Externalities Private benefits Earnings Age Foregone earnings Private costs Government expenditures Curve h 1 represents the earnings over time of someone without education. Someone who invests in human capital will have earnings curve h 2 minus costs of education c 2 . Because of externalities (the shaded area above h 2 ), the return to education is higher than the private return. This justifies the government funding portion of the cost of education (blue box next to c 2 ).

Delivering Education in Developing Countries In primary school, there are 43 pupils per teacher in low-income countries, whereas the corresponding ratio in high-income countries is 14 to 1, less than a third as many pupils! In sub-Saharan Africa and in South Asia, primary schools have, on average, over 40 pupils per class, which represents large class sizes. In comparison, East Asia has much smaller class sizes with 18 pupils per teacher. Another quality indicator is teacher training. In high-income countries, all teachers, as a rule, have received the required training to be a teacher. This is not always the case in developing countries. According to the World Development Indicators, only 80% of primary-school teachers in low-income countries have received teacher training. Obviously, lack of training has a negative effect on education quality. Other factors also affect the quality of education such as a critical shortage or absence of resources. Not only do pupils lack textbooks, but many schools have no blackboards. For example, in 1998, 39% of primary-school classrooms in rural areas of Vietnam’s Northern Uplands region did not have blackboards. Many schools do not have desks or benches—children have to sit on the ground, while other schools are without classrooms so that many classes take place outside. We could argue that motivated teachers can, to some degree, overcome these adverse circumstances by passionately engaging with their pupils and inspiring them to learn. However, in many cases teacher motivation is an even greater problem than a lack of resources. Teacher absenteeism is a very widespread problem; children often walk for miles to go to school only to find that their teacher has not shown up. Surprise visits in primary schools in six developing countries showed that about 19% of the teachers were absent.

Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have the largest class sizes. Source : The World Bank, World Development Indicators, 2012. TABLE 5 Class Sizes (Pupil-Teacher Ratio) in Primary School, 2010 


Delivering Education in Developing Countries Moreover, the average years of schooling have increased every decade in every region of the world, which is certainly an optimistic trend. How much progress has been made in the last decades? In 1950, the average years of schooling in low-income countries stood only at 2.05. Substantial progress has occurred in South Asia, where the average years of schooling went from 1.02 in 1950 to 5.24 in 2010. Progress has even been faster in the Middle East/North Africa region (MENA), where the average years of schooling went from 0.76 to 7.12 during the same period. Another measure of educational achievement is the youth literacy rate (see Table 2). Primary-school enrollment does not automatically guarantee stable literacy rates in developing countries. What often happens is that after primary school, many children go to work and do not use the reading and writing skills that they acquired. They can then lose those skills especially if the skills were not firmly ingrained in the first place. As noted previously, in many countries, children also pass into higher grades automatically without having acquired the basic competencies of the lower grades. Can we go beyond measuring educational achievement with literacy rates and look at more advanced skills that are taught in secondary school? A useful tool for that purpose is the PISA test for 15-year-olds. PISA stands for “Program for International Student Assessment.” It is run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to compare the educational achievements of those students who are about to finish secondary school. It is a good indicator of education quality. The PISA test data do not represent as many countries as is the case for other measures of educational achievement. While the PISA database also includes more high- and middle-income countries than low-income countries, it is nevertheless quite useful. The tests measure reading and comprehension skills and are thus more specific than a simple literacy test. Table 4 gives PISA scores for reading and math skills for a representative sample of developed and developing countries in the database, most of which are middle-income countries. The results show heterogeneity in reading and math scores, highlighting the difference in the quality of education across the world. There are several other striking observations we can make about the table’s data: Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore score very high, as does Japan. All these countries have scores that are far above the OECD average. The United States does reasonably well on reading scores (though it is only ranked in 17th place), but is below the OECD average on math scores, ranking in 31st place, which is somewhere in the middle, as the sample includes 65 countries. Apart from the East Asian countries cited above, developing countries generally have lower scores than developed countries; for example, Kyrgyzstan has the worst scores, lower than Peru. We thus see a clear difference between more-developed and lessdeveloped countries in terms of education quality as measured by reading and math skills. The picture would even be clearer if we had scores for some of the poorest countries in the world. To summarize, while remarkable progress in closing the primary-school education gap between developed and developing countries has been observed

Delivering Education in Developing Countries The Secondary-School Gap What about the gap in secondary-school education (middle and high school)? Figure 2 gives net secondary-school enrollment rates for different regions of the world in 2007. There is clearly a larger gap for secondary than for primary education and countries from sub-Saharan Africa tend to have the lowest secondary-school enrollment rates. In 2007, Niger had a secondary-school enrollment rate of 9%, with Burundi at 9. %, Mozambique at 10. %, Burkina Faso at 12%, Mauritania at 16%, and Madagascar at 22%. The only country outside sub-Saharan Africa to have secondary-school enrollment rates below 30% is Afghanistan at 24%. Pakistan, Cambodia, and Laos have relatively low enrollment rates with, respectively, 32. %, 35%, and 36%. South Asia as a whole has a secondary enrollment rate barely above 40%. Note that some successful developing countries have been making substantial investments in secondary education; South Korea has a gross enrollment rate of 95. %, which is higher than that of the United States (91%)! Former socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe have, in general, very high secondary-school enrollment rates that are comparable to those of the most advanced economies. The Educational Gender Gap The educational gender gap measures the difference in educational achievements between boys and girls. This is an important issue, as boys and girls are not necessarily treated equally across countries. In some countries, girls are discriminated against both by their families and by society at large. When this FIGURE 1 Net Primary-School Enrollment Rates in 2010 0 100 90 80 60 70 50 40 30 20 10 East Asia & Pacific Eastern Europe & Central Asia Latin America & Caribbean Middle East & North Africa South Asia Sub Saharan Africa Net enrollment rates are above 90% in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development The BancoSol or Banco Solidario in Bolivia started a microfinance program by lending to groups and then later introduced individual loan contracts with group liability. It is a more urban bank, its borrowers are typically wealthier than the clients of the Grameen Bank, and its loans are generally larger, as well. The BancoSol has become an important player in Bolivia’s banking system. Bank Rakyat in Indonesia is a more traditional institution. It does not provide group lending and does require collateral. Its loans are roughly 10 times higher, on average, than those of the Grameen Bank. However, it operates primarily in rural areas and lends on a relatively small scale, while encouraging people in those areas to save. Progressive lending is a key formula for Bank Rakyat and its repayment rates have been very high, even higher than those for conventional commercial banks. Bank Kredit Desa, which also operates in Indonesia, makes smaller loans to the poorest households. In 1996, the average loan size was even smaller than that for the Grameen Bank, and loan duration was rather short, 3 months on average. The system replicates some of the properties of group lending even though it does lend to individuals. The originality of the bank’s approach is that it uses the rural authority structure to allocate loans and to enforce loan payments. Bank funds are allocated by village-level management commissions that are led by village leaders. Decisions are made locally using readily available information about the reliability and intent of borrowers, with the result that the worst credit risks are avoided. Using the local authority structure also works well in terms of enforcing loan repayment; default rates on these loans have been very low. In Latin America, the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA) set up a network of village banks in the mid-1980s. Its model has been replicated in other countries and continents, and it serves nearly 90,000 clients in Peru, Haiti, Malawi, Uganda, and Kyrgyzstan, and the United States. Under the program, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) help FINCA set up village bank branches in partnership with local authorities or civil associations, allowing substantial local autonomy over loan decisions and management. As with the Grameen Bank, clients are mostly poor women in rural areas and the size of the loans is quite small. In the standard model, an initial loan is made to the village bank and its 30-50 members. The bank then lends to members of the program, starting with amounts of about $50 with a 4-month term. Subsequent loan sizes are tied to the amount that members have on deposit with the bank. The originality of the program is that it includes a savings component; the size of a loan cannot exceed 5 times the value of the savings deposit. Is Microfinance Profitable? Is microfinance simply a private innovation made by profit-maximizing entrepreneurs or is it more a form of development aid? Is microfinance profitable? Is it sustainable without subsidies and outside financial aid? The answers to these questions depend on the bank in question. The general answer, though, is that profitability is not a general characteristic of microfinance institutions. Table 3 provides some figures that give an idea of profitability. 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development The BancoSol or Banco Solidario in Bolivia started a microfinance program by lending to groups and then later introduced individual loan contracts with group liability. It is a more urban bank, its borrowers are typically wealthier than the clients of the Grameen Bank, and its loans are generally larger, as well. The BancoSol has become an important player in Bolivia’s banking system. Bank Rakyat in Indonesia is a more traditional institution. It does not provide group lending and does require collateral. Its loans are roughly 10 times higher, on average, than those of the Grameen Bank. However, it operates primarily in rural areas and lends on a relatively small scale, while encouraging people in those areas to save. Progressive lending is a key formula for Bank Rakyat and its repayment rates have been very high, even higher than those for conventional commercial banks. Bank Kredit Desa, which also operates in Indonesia, makes smaller loans to the poorest households. In 1996, the average loan size was even smaller than that for the Grameen Bank, and loan duration was rather short, 3 months on average. The system replicates some of the properties of group lending even though it does lend to individuals. The originality of the bank’s approach is that it uses the rural authority structure to allocate loans and to enforce loan payments. Bank funds are allocated by village-level management commissions that are led by village leaders. Decisions are made locally using readily available information about the reliability and intent of borrowers, with the result that the worst credit risks are avoided. Using the local authority structure also works well in terms of enforcing loan repayment; default rates on these loans have been very low.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries enrollment rates for low-income countries stood at 83%. In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region of the world, gross enrollment rates in primary school were still only at 92% in 2005, but they stood at 99% in 2010. In 1980, the gross enrollment rate in that region stood at 80%, so progress has been made. However, South Asia (mostly India and the surrounding countries) has seen more rapid progress. The primary-school enrollment rates in 1980 were at 77%, but in 2005 they were already at 110%. Grade repetition is not the only reason why gross enrollment rates may exaggerate actual school enrollment rates. The number of children of primaryschool age is calculated using census data, whereas the number of children attending school is calculated on the basis of data provided by the schools. Schools may have a tendency to exaggerate their pupil numbers because the subsidies the schools receive depend on those numbers. For example, in India, 1993 school data gave an official enrollment rate of 104. %, but data from household surveys on primary-school attendance showed a primary enrollment rate of only 95%. Net enrollment rates subtract from the gross enrollment data the number of pupils who are older than the relevant age group. Unfortunately, data on net enrollment rates are not as widely available as data on gross enrollment rates, and we only have data for very recent years. Figure 1 gives net enrollment rates for various regions of the world in 2010. Net enrollment rates are generally above 90% except for sub-Saharan Africa, where they were at 76%. Even looking at net enrollment rates, we see that primary education is now more or less generalized in the developing world.

Market Development immediately rush there to supply additional quantities at the higher price until prices are equalized. Now, if we allow for transportation costs, prices will not necessarily be the same everywhere because these costs vary from region to region; however, price variations will be the same. Indeed, look again at the example of the two regions. Suppose there is a shortage of rice in region A but not in region B. Traders will move rice from region B to region A up to the point where the advantage of selling in region B or transporting rice to region A and incurring the transport costs are equal. The point here is that prices in region B will increase following the price increase in region A; as rice moves out of region B to region A, the supply of rice in region B is reduced, thereby leading to an equivalent increase in price in region B as well. Measures of market integration that economic researchers have devised aim precisely at capturing to what extent prices for the same goods move in the same direction at the same time. If this simultaneous movement is present, we can say that markets are integrated. If, on the other hand, prices in different regions do not move in the same direction at a specific moment in time, this can be seen as evidence that markets are not integrated. The methods researchers use to measure this integration are quite technical and we will not analyze them in depth. However, the general principle is to test whether prices of the same or similar goods are moving in the same direction at the same time across different regions. Lack of integration or insufficient integration may be due to several different factors. For example, lack of communication and transportation infrastructures can impact market integration. Without adequate communication technologies, traders in region B may not be aware of shortages in region A; as a result, there will be no market reaction to those shortages and merchants will not take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities that emerge. Transportation difficulties can also affect integration if it is very difficult to move goods between regions, either because of geographical factors (distance, terrain, etc.) or lack of infrastructure (roads, bridges, trains). There may, however, also be obstacles to integration that are the result of government regulations. We will look at these different obstacles in turn. Communication Obstacles to Market Integration In modern markets, communication is a key factor in integration. In financial markets, trades are made continuously on a 24-hour cycle. Any information on world events (an earthquake in Asia, poor returns for a global enterprise, a war that flares within or between nations) is instantaneously transmitted to the world’s financial markets where this information is then reflected in prices. Global markets for commodities function in a similar way. Physically, most of these markets are located in the wealthiest cities in the world: New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Tokyo. In the poorest regions of the world, however, communication is much slower, with the result that markets do not respond as quickly to changing conditions as they do in the developed world. A good example of the effects of communication technologies is a study done by Jenny Aker on integration in Niger’s grain market before and after

Delivering Education in Developing Countries developing and developed countries and we highlight the educational gender gap in developing countries. Measures of educational achievement in developing countries show that there are significant discrepancies in the quality and delivery of education services. We then examine the economic returns to education in developing countries, i.e., the additional income generated by education, a major topic in the economics of education. We also discuss institutional issues of education, such as corruption in education; public funds for education are often diverted and end up in the pockets of dishonest politicians. Finally, we discuss educational reforms and review research that shows which reforms work and which do not. This is an exciting field of research that has produced many randomized evaluations in recent years. We discuss how best to fight teacher absenteeism and what incentives can improve teaching quality. We also consider these questions: Which policies work best to reduce the educational gender gap? What is the effect of decentralization that gives more power to local communities to monitor education? What do we know about experiments in developing economies with government-subsidized vouchers that allow children to attend private schools? We also discuss many experimental policies to reduce the costs of schooling and to enhance school participation, such as transfers to mothers to pay for their children’s education, free school meals, free uniforms and textbooks, or grants for classroom improvements. Measuring the Education Gap The education gap between developing and developed countries is more important at the secondary (middle and high school) and at the tertiary level (college and higher education) than at the primary school level. How has the education gap evolved over time? The Primary School Gap Table 1 shows the gross enrollment rates for primary schools in different parts of the world between 1980 and 2010. These rates measure the number of students enrolled in primary school as a percentage of children of primaryschool age. As we can see in Table 1, gross enrollment rates are often higher than 100%. Why is that? The rates are calculated by dividing the number of primary-school children by the number of children who are old enough to be in primary school. As a result, if children repeat certain classes and are still attending primary school when they are older than primary-school age, they will be counted in the numerator but not in the denominator. For example, assume that 100% of children attend primary school, that primary school is 4 years (which is the case in many countries), and that all children complete primary school in 5 years instead of 4. Finally, assume that the number of children in each age group is the same. In that case, because of grade repetition, the gross enrollment rate will be 125%. Looking at Table 1, we can see that in 2005, gross primary-school enrollment rates were already above 100%, whether in low-income, middle-income, or high-income countries. However, this was not the case in 1980 when average

The Role of Credit Markets in Development firm from k b 0 to k b 1 , then the effect will be to increase the total investment of the firm from k 0 to k 1 . This results in an effect on output because the total level of capital invested in the firm increases. To summarize the discussion, a firm that is only credit rationed but not credit constrained will take more credit at the subsidized rate, if offered, but it will not increase its total level of investment and output. On the other hand, a firm that is credit constrained will increase its investment and output when offered more credit at the subsidized rate. Banerjee and Duflo tested these predictions on a database that included 249 Indian firms with investments between 6.5 and 30 million rupees. These firms received increases in working capital after 1998, while those with capital between 10 and 30 million rupees were subject to a reduction in working capital after 2000. Between 1998 and 2000, firms did not experience a significant fall in interest rates. This means that the increase in working capital was not due to a fall in interest rates, but to the reform in the rules for priority lending. The most important finding is that the expansion of loans for larger firms was not associated with a significant fall in market lending. Increased lending was associated with an increase in output as measured by sales. These results suggest not only the existence of credit rationing for firms, but also the clear presence of credit constraints. Further studies are likely to show that credit constraints are pervasive in developing countries. A firm can borrow k b 0 from the bank at rate r b and the difference up to k 0 at rate r m . Its total demand for credit is not satisfied, as the marginal product of capital at k 0 is higher than r m . The firm is credit rationed and credit constrained. If the bank extends its credit to k b 1 7 k b 0 , total credit given to the firm increases from to k 0 to k 1 . FIGURE 2 A Credit-Constrained Firm r m F H ( k ) r b k b 0 k b 1 k 1 k k 0

Delivering Education in Developing Countries is the case, parents tend to invest less in the education of their daughters than in that of their sons. Table 2 shows the differences in primary-school completion rates and literacy rates for boys and girls in 2005. As we can see in 2005, there was still a 10% gender gap in primary education completion and an even larger gap in youth literacy rates. This gap is present mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. We do not see it in Latin America and East Asia. The Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region has 86% primary-school completion rates for both boys and girls, but the literacy rate for girls is only 77% compared to 89% for boys, which suggests a gender gap in actual educational achievements. Educational Achievements Another way to look at the education gap is to compare measures of educational achievement. Table 3 shows a first measure: the average years of schooling for adults above age 15, a measure compiled and perfected at regular intervals by Robert Barro of Harvard University and Jong-Wha Lee of Korea University. In 2010, adults in developing countries had 7.09 average years of schooling compared to 11.03 for advanced countries. This gap reflects the fact that secondary education is still not very widespread in many developing countries. SubSaharan Africa has the lowest average years of schooling ( .23 years) followed by South Asia with 5.24 years. Measured this way, the education gap is still quite significant, but it is much lower than it used to be in previous decades.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development k 0 . Indeed, k 0 is the level of capital at which the marginal product of capital is equal to the market interest rate r m . For a level of capital above k 0 , the marginal product is lower than the interest rate, which means that the firm would lose money from investing above k 0 . The firm would thus borrow k b 0 at the lower rate r b and the difference between k 0 and k b 0 at rate r m . Now assume that the firm can borrow the higher amount k b 1 from the bank, where k b 1 6 k 0 . In this case, the firm will borrow k b 1 at rate r b and the difference between k 0 and k b 1 at rate r m . The firm’s total demand for credit remains at k 0 , but it now borrows more from the bank and less from the market. The total demand for credit by the firm stays the same. Because the firm simply reallocates its credit portfolio, the higher availability of credit from the bank does not have any effect on the firm’s output. In other words, when a firm is credit rationed but not credit constrained, a lower rationing of credit does not have an effect on the total demand for credit and thus on the firm’s output level. Now consider the case of a firm that is credit-constrained, as illustrated in Figure 2. In contrast to the previous case, it is assumed that the firm is also rationed on the credit market. Initially, it can only borrow k b 0 at rate r b and it can only borrow up to k 0 at rate r m on the market. At k 0 , the marginal product of capital is higher than r m . The firm would therefore like to borrow more but is not able to do so. It is not only credit rationed, it is also credit constrained. In this case, if the bank increases the supply of capital it is willing to lend to the FIGURE 1 A Credit-Rationed Firm k b 0 r m F H ( k ) r b k b 1 k b 2 k k 0 A firm can borrow k bo from the bank at rate r b and the difference up to k 0 at rate r m . At k 0 , the firm’s total demand for credit is satisfied as the marginal product of capital is equal to r m . The firm is credit rationed but not credit constrained. If the bank extends its credit to k b 1 7 k b 0 , total credit demand by the firm remains at k 0 . 


The Role of Credit Markets in Development k 0 . Indeed, k 0 is the level of capital at which the marginal product of capital is equal to the market interest rate r m . For a level of capital above k 0 , the marginal product is lower than the interest rate, which means that the firm would lose money from investing above k 0 . The firm would thus borrow k b 0 at the lower rate r b and the difference between k 0 and k b 0 at rate r m . Now assume that the firm can borrow the higher amount k b 1 from the bank, where k b 1 6 k 0 . In this case, the firm will borrow k b 1 at rate r b and the difference between k 0 and k b 1 at rate r m . The firm’s total demand for credit remains at k 0 , but it now borrows more from the bank and less from the market. The total demand for credit by the firm stays the same. Because the firm simply reallocates its credit portfolio, the higher availability of credit from the bank does not have any effect on the firm’s output. In other words, when a firm is credit rationed but not credit constrained, a lower rationing of credit does not have an effect on the total demand for credit and thus on the firm’s output level. Now consider the case of a firm that is credit-constrained, as illustrated in Figure 2. In contrast to the previous case, it is assumed that the firm is also rationed on the credit market. Initially, it can only borrow k b 0 at rate r b and it can only borrow up to k 0 at rate r m on the market. At k 0 , the marginal product of capital is higher than r m . The firm would therefore like to borrow more but is not able to do so. It is not only credit rationed, it is also credit constrained. In this case, if the bank increases the supply of capital it is willing to lend to the FIGURE 1 A Credit-Rationed Firm k b 0 r m F H ( k ) r b k b 1 k b 2 k k 0 A firm can borrow k bo from the bank at rate r b and the difference up to k 0 at rate r m .

If the bank extends its credit to k b 1 7 k b 0 , total credit demand by the firm remains at k 0 . 


Poverty and Inequality Figure 1 contains information on the quintile distribution of income with the first quintile having 5% of income, the first two having 15%, the first three having 35%, and the first four having 60%, with the richest quintile holding the remaining 40%. The area S is formed from one triangle and four trapezoids. The triangle has an area 0. ( .2 * 0.05) = 0.005. Recall that the formula of a trapezoid is its base multiplied by half of the sum of its two heights. Given that all four trapezoids have the same base, their area is equal to: 0. [( .05 + 0.15)/2 + ( .15 + 0.35)/2 + ( .35 + 0. )/2 + ( .6 + 1)/ ] = 0. (.05/2 + 0.15 + 0.35 + 0.6 + 1/ ) = 0.325. S is then equal to 0.325 + 0.005 = 0.33. The Gini coefficient is equal to 1 2 * 0.33 = 0.34. We can calculate Gini coefficients once we have information on the quantiles of income distribution. Real-world Gini coefficients. Figure 4 provides Gini coefficients (expressed in percentages between 0 and 100) for a selected group of countries, primarily from 2010, but also from various other years. 9 The Gini coefficients shown in Figure 4 take values between 25 for Sweden on the low end, and 59 for Haiti on the high end. Latin American countries, African countries, and China have relatively high income inequality. India’s Gini (33. ) is nearly 10 percentage points lower than that of China (42. ).

Economic Growth As we can see from Figure 6, there is a strong positive correlation between log GDP per capita and protection against expropriation risks. Note that because we are looking at log GDP per capita and not directly at growth rates, we are capturing growth in the long term, that is, over centuries rather than over decades. In fact, taking log GDP per capita as a measure of long-term growth is equivalent to measuring growth with an initial level of GDP per capita close to zero, which is a good approximation of what it was many centuries ago. Even though there is a strong correlation between institutions and growth, correlation is not causation. It is not clear that institutions cause growth. The causality could go the other way. One could indeed argue that poorer countries cannot afford good institutions and that they can introduce better institutions only after achieving a certain level of development. Even if reverse causality is not convincing, there could be omitted variable bias: a third variable that explains both the quality of institutions and growth. One of the reasons why the article by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson became so famous is that they were able to demonstrate empirically a causal effect of institutions on growth using the instrumental variable technique by showing that institutional differences in developing countries have their origins in different rates of settler mortality at the time of colonization.

Poverty and Inequality distribution is roughly that of the United States with a Gini of 40. . The average for developed OECD countries is around 35. The other countries shown in Figure 4 have a relatively equal distribution of income. Sweden, Belarus, and Germany all have a Gini below 30. Are there any specific geographic patterns of inequality, especially in the developing world? Table 4 gives us the answer. 10 The first column shows the Gini coefficient and the second column shows the decile ratio (top 10% average income over bottom 10% average income). We see that the highest Gini coefficient is in Latin America and the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan Africa also has a high degree of income inequality. All other regions have a Gini below 40%. Note that the decile ratio gives the same ranking. It is striking to see that the decile ratio is 2 to 3 times higher in Latin America than everywhere else. It is well known that the very wealthy in many Latin American countries live like their affluent counterparts in the United States, enjoying private jets, huge properties with armies of servants, and access to all the best amenities available in any fully developed country. However, the poor in Latin America, especially the indigenous populations, live in extreme poverty, barely making ends meet, 10 The numbers presented in Table 4 are averages based on country data. Care must be taken when interpreting them. The Gini coefficient for Latin America cannot be calculated by taking the average Gini coefficient for countries in that region. Nevertheless, a high average Gini coefficient for a region compared to others will tend to show that inequality is higher in that region.

Economic Growth 3. In the Romer model, rich countries should grow faster than poor countries because of their higher existing stock of knowledge. 17 The model predicts divergence between poor and rich countries, not convergence. The Solow model predicts that poorer countries with low capital intensity should experience higher growth rates and converge at the income level of richer countries. If the Romer model is a better description of reality than the Solow model, then we must be very concerned about whether poor countries will be able to catch up with rich countries. Intellectual Property Rights and Technology Transfers Development economists focus primarily on the divergence result of the Romer model. This result, however, ignores trade and circulation of information between rich and poor countries. According to the logic of the Romer model, even though the rich countries are most productive at research, technology transfers from the rich to the poor countries could avoid economic divergence between them. An implication of this proposition is that the protection of intellectual property rights at the international level is not beneficial to poor countries because it hinders technology transfers that would reduce divergence between rich and poor countries. 17 However, empirical research has shown that the Romer model is too extreme in terms of its treatment of the research sector. See, for example, Charles I. Jones, “R&D-Based Models of Economic Growth,” Journal of Political Economy, 103, no. 4 (August 1995): 759—784. At the international level, intellectual property rights are an important source of disagreement between rich and poor countries. In the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United States is fighting for the protection of intellectual property rights. For example, it has raised complaints about Chinese companies that have pirated software from Microsoft and other technologies from various companies. The Chinese seem to excel at taking apart Western products and reproducing cheaper versions that sell very successfully in mainland China and other Asian markets. Because American companies put the money and time into developing and producing the original products, they claim that it is unfair that the Chinese are making profits from copying their ideas. The economic argument for the strict enforcement of intellectual property rights is that the prospect of temporary monopoly profits is necessary to create incentives for innovation. In the end, poor countries will benefit from the availability of more effective drugs, better cars, and advanced computers, as these goods will be cheaper to buy and of better quality. Thus, strict enforcement of property rights should also be in their interests. There are also powerful arguments against overly strict enforcement of property rights at the international level. First, poor countries may directly benefit from technological transfers at the lowest possible price. These transfers counter the tendency toward divergence in economic development and give poor countries an opportunity to catch up. Second, by granting poor countries easy access to advanced technologies and thus helping them to achieve higher growth rates, the demand for products from innovating firms and rich countries will increase.

Poverty and Inequality ratio around 50% (49. % for Bangladesh and 54. % for Congo). However, the average poverty gap in Congo is nearly twice that in Bangladesh, suggesting that among those living below the poverty line, there is more extreme poverty in Congo relative to Bangladesh. Even though the average poverty gap gives a more accurate view of poverty than does the poverty headcount ratio, it is not always possible to compute the poverty gap accurately, as we need data on the income distribution of those below the poverty line. How to Compare Poverty Levels Our next task is comparing measures of poverty across countries. The poverty line varies from country to country. Most of the poor in the United States would not qualify as poor in India. For comparisons across countries to be meaningful, we need to compare poverty only across developing countries, excluding the wealthy developed nations. Poverty lines and exchange rates. One method that compares poverty across countries takes a particular country’s poverty line and converts it into other countries’ currencies. For example, we can take the poverty line of India in rupees and the poverty line in Thailand in baht and convert them into dollars using current exchange rates. With the Indian and Thai poverty lines expressed in U.S. dollar terms, we can make an objective comparison. A problem arises with this method because exchange rates between currencies only reflect the prices of exported and imported goods. All goods that are not exported and imported are called non-tradables. These goods are very important for the poor because in developing countries, the poor are unable to buy expensive imported goods. As a result, currency conversions of poverty lines based on exchange rates may give a misleading comparison of living standards across countries.

Economic Growth Income Convergence The most basic prediction of the Solow model is income convergence : poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they have a higher marginal product of capital. Eventually, the income gap should tighten and countries should all converge to the same steady state. Of course, this is only the case if all countries have the same savings rate, depreciation rate, population growth rate, and total factor productivity. Everything else being equal, the model predicts income convergence. A whole body of economics literature has developed to examine whether or not we can observe convergence in income per capita. 11 There is not much evidence of income per capita convergence. Figure 4 plots the GDP per worker in 1960 and the vertical axis shows the real annual 11 See, for example, Robert J. Barro, “Economic Growth in a Cross Section of Countries,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 106, no. 2 (1991): 407-443; and Danny T.

Economic Growth Differences in Human Capital When analyzing differences in growth, the accumulation of physical capital is not the only relevant variable. Another important variable is human capital, or the knowledge embodied in people. People in rich countries are generally more highly educated than are people in poor countries. What can the Solow model tell us about differences in human capital? To explore this question, we need to modify the Cobb-Douglas production function and introduce a human capital parameter h to take into account the idea that those who are more educated are more productive. In other words, a country with more human capital will have more effective labor than one with less human capital. Parameter h, representing the average level of human capital, will be higher in countries where people are better educated: Y t = AK t a ( hL t ) 1 a = ( Ah 1 a ) K t a L t 1 a (23) The expression on the right-hand side shows that we can analyze the model with human capital in a similar way as the above model: parameter A has now been replaced by Ah 1 a . Using our expression for the steady state, we simply replace A with Ah 1 a ; we then get: y * = 3 ( h 1 a ) A 4 1 1 a a s n + d b a 1 a = hA 1 1 a a s n + d b a 1 a (24) Steady state income per capita depends directly on the level of human capital. If two countries, 1 and 2, differ only in terms of human capital, then their income ratios should be equal to h 1 / h 2 . Differences in human capital are a better predictor of differences in income per capita than are investment rates. However, differences in human capital cannot be the whole story behind differences in growth and development. For example, the level of human capital was quite high in the former socialist countries under central planning, but growth still lagged. When the transition to a market economy started, economists were very optimistic about the prospects of growth for those countries because of the very high initial level of human capital, but that optimism faded when the GDPs of those countries began to decline. For some, the output fall lasted only a few years, but in the former Soviet Union, it lasted for the better part of the 1990s. The level of human capital also started to decline in the former Soviet Union following the fall in output. This means that increased education expenditures might not only be the cause of growth but also the result of growth. Countries that grow fast may be able to afford a better education. The direction of causality between human capital and growth is unclear. Apart from the question of causality, differences in human capital are not extreme enough to explain the differences in development between countries. Differences in education should predict that Mali, one of the poorest countries in the world, would have roughly one-third of the income per capita of the United States. 10 In reality, it has only 3% of U.S. income per capita. 10 Data from Robert E. Hall and Charles I. Jones, “Why Do Some Countries Produce So Much More Output Per Worker than Others?” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 114, no. 1 (1999): 91. 


Economic Growth Differences in Human Capital When analyzing differences in growth, the accumulation of physical capital is not the only relevant variable. Another important variable is human capital, or the knowledge embodied in people. People in rich countries are generally more highly educated than are people in poor countries. What can the Solow model tell us about differences in human capital? To explore this question, we need to modify the Cobb-Douglas production function and introduce a human capital parameter h to take into account the idea that those who are more educated are more productive. In other words, a country with more human capital will have more effective labor than one with less human capital. Parameter h, representing the average level of human capital, will be higher in countries where people are better educated: Y t = AK t a ( hL t ) 1 a = ( Ah 1 a ) K t a L t 1 a (23) The expression on the right-hand side shows that we can analyze the model with human capital in a similar way as the above model: parameter A has now been replaced by Ah 1 a . Using our expression for the steady state, we simply replace A with Ah 1 a ; we then get: y * = 3 ( h 1 a ) A 4 1 1 a a s n + d b a 1 a = hA 1 1 a a s n + d b a 1 a (24) Steady state income per capita depends directly on the level of human capital. If two countries, 1 and 2, differ only in terms of human capital, then their income ratios should be equal to h 1 / h 2 . Differences in human capital are a better predictor of differences in income per capita than are investment rates. However, differences in human capital cannot be the whole story behind differences in growth and development. For example, the level of human capital was quite high in the former socialist countries under central planning, but growth still lagged. When the transition to a market economy started, economists were very optimistic about the prospects of growth for those countries because of the very high initial level of human capital, but that optimism faded when the GDPs of those countries began to decline. For some, the output fall lasted only a few years, but in the former Soviet Union, it lasted for the better part of the 1990s. The level of human capital also started to decline in the former Soviet Union following the fall in output. This means that increased education expenditures might not only be the cause of growth but also the result of growth. Countries that grow fast may be able to afford a better education. The direction of causality between human capital and growth is unclear. Apart from the question of causality, differences in human capital are not extreme enough to explain the differences in development between countries. Differences in education should predict that Mali, one of the poorest countries in the world, would have roughly one-third of the income per capita of the United States. 10 In reality, it has only 3% of U.S. income per capita. 10 Data from Robert E. Hall and Charles I. Jones, “Why Do Some Countries Produce So Much More Output Per Worker than Others?” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 114, no. 1 (1999): 91. 


Economic Growth was, however, only 10% that of the United States. Neither capital accumulation nor human capital accumulation can explain the difference in output per worker in China relative to the United States. We can reach the same conclusion looking at India, Kenya, or Zaire (today called the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Accumulation of physical and human capital would predict a much smaller difference in output per worker than is the case in reality. We also see that the standard deviation of total factor productivity is very high across the world. If we cannot explain differences in levels of economic growth using only capital accumulation and differences in human capital, and if variations in total factor productivity are the main driver of differences in output per worker, then what explains those differences in total factor productivity? We now discuss two competing hypotheses that seek to provide an answer: geography and institutions. The geographical view emphasizes differences in climate and geographical isolation as a cause of differences in economic growth rates. The institutional view postulates a causal effect of institutions on growth: countries that have strong institutions to protect property rights and investment will grow and develop faster than countries with weak institutions.

Economic Growth Geography and Growth In a series of articles, Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist, and his various coauthors have emphasized the role of two important geographical facts relevant to growth: the importance of latitude (distance to the equator) and geographical isolation. 19 A first striking fact is that there are very few rich countries between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The poorest countries of the world are located in those tropical latitudes closest to the equator, while the rich countries tend to be located in the more temperate zones outside the tropics. Most of the African continent is located in the tropics, along with most of the poorest countries in the world. Parts of Mexico, all of Central America, and most of South America are also in the tropics. Southeast Asia and a large part of South Asia are located within the tropics as well; the only rich country in the tropics is Singapore. 20 As far as geographical isolation is concerned, there is in general much less population density in landlocked areas. Large parts of Africa are landlocked and most African rivers are not navigable. Significant areas of Russia are landlocked as well as most of Central Asia. The U.S. Midwest and extensive regions of northern Canada are also landlocked and very lightly populated, while landlocked areas of Africa, Central Asia, Northern India, and Russia are somewhat more densely populated than the latter. Note also that while large parts of China are not landlocked because of a long coastline and the presence of two very large rivers that cross China (the Yangtze and the Yellow River), there are still areas of China that are both densely populated and distant from major waterways. Economic reasons for the importance of geography. Why does geography matter for growth and development? The key reasons are as follows: 1. The areas within the tropics are less hospitable because of tropical diseases and the intense heat. Tropical diseases have tended to increase mortality and have negatively impacted the general health of the population. Moreover, the extreme heat makes hard physical labor outdoors, especially farming, difficult. 2. Significant volatility in rainfall amounts is prevalent in tropical countries. Tropical areas receive a lot of rain, which should be good for agriculture, but there is too much rainfall volatility to allow stable agricultural production. Many areas in India, for example, will not have any rain for months, but during the monsoon season, the daily rainfall will often cause deadly floods. 3. Landlocked areas have high transportation costs. Easy access to coastal areas facilitates trade, as ships can carry large amounts of goods between international seaports and ports on navigable rivers. The role of geography in practice. Because geography is a factor that is truly exogenous to the economic system, it seems quite plausible that it should play a role in development. However, there are reasons to question whether geography is the main cause of differences in development across the world today. If geography played a major role in development, then the countries 20 Northern Australia is located in the tropics. 19 John Luke Gallup, Jeffrey D. Sachs, and Andrew D. Mellinger, “Geography and Economic Development,” International Regional Science Review 22, no. 2 (August 1999): 19-232.

Economic Growth effect of the log of settler mortality on protection against expropriation. The coefficient is equal to - .61 with a standard error of 0.13. The second column introduces the absolute value of latitude as an independent variable by measuring distance to the equator. Its coefficient has large standard errors both in the first-stage and second-stage regression and thus is not significant. It also has the wrong sign, as we would expect a positive sign in line with the geography explanation of growth: the higher the distance from the equator the higher the growth.

Economic Growth Marginal productivity The output increase caused by an additional unit of a factor of production in the production process. Marginal productivity of capital The output increase caused by an additional unit of capital in the production process. Marginal productivity of labor The output increase caused by an additional unit of labor in the production process. Monopoly rents Extra profits derived from mo-nopoly status. Non-rival good A good that can still be consumed by the seller after it is sold. Most normal economic goods are rival goods; once they are sold, the seller can no longer consume them. Production function A mathematical expression of the joint effect of the factors of production on output. Call K t the stock of capital in the economy during year t , call L t the amount of labor, and call Y t output in the economy. The production function is: Y t = F ( K t , L t ). Steady state A situation in which an economic variable remains constant over time. Total factor productivity The part of output that labor and capital productivity cannot explain. It is usually thought to be the result of technological progress. Value added The value of output minus the value of inputs used in production.

Economic Growth of the part of the variation of the independent variable that is explained by the variation of the instrumental variable. Because the latter is not correlated with the dependent variable, we can then be confident that the part of the variation of the independent variable predicted by the instrumental variable is truly independent from the dependent variable. In a second stage, we then regress the dependent variable on the part of the independent variable predicted by the instrumental variable. The estimation coming out of this second stage gives us an estimate of a true causal effect from the independent to the dependent variable. Why can settler mortality be a good instrumental variable? Acemoglu et al. first argued that settler mortality centuries ago could not have had a direct impact on today’s level of economic development. In other words, settler mortality is uncorrelated with the dependent variable (log GDP per capita). On the other hand, as we saw in Figure 7, there is a negative correlation between settler mortality (measured in logs) and protection against expropriation. In other words, countries that had high settler mortality at the time of colonization have weak institutions today. The regression analysis in Table 2 gives the evidence for the institutional theory of growth. The basic result is in the first column of the table. Look first at panel C, which gives the ordinary least squares regression of log GDP per capita against protection from expropriation. Notice that the coefficient is equal to 0.52 (with a standard error of 0.06 in parentheses below). Look now at panel A, which is the instrumental variable regression called the second stage. Here, the coefficient is larger ( .94 with a standard error of 0.16). Finally, panel B gives the first-stage regressions, i.e., the FIGURE 7 A Negative Correlation between Settler Mortality and Protection against Expropriation 2 4 6 8 10 4 Log of settler mortality Average expropriation risk 1985 H 1995 6 8 The early mortality of European colonial settlers several hundred years ago is negatively correlated with the quality of institutions at the end of the 20th century.

While the explanations in the tables are usually intuitive enough for students to grasp their insights, some students may be curious to know more about the statistical and econometric techniques that are used in many of the tables presented. This appendix provides explanations for all of the different techniques used. For students who have had an introductory econometrics course, this appendix is probably not necessary. However, some introductory econometrics courses do not cover all the relevant material covered here. Our aim is to familiarize students with some of the very basic research tools used in development economics.

A reader will be unable to grasp the exciting new insights in development economics without understanding these techniques and how they contribute to improving our scientific understanding of development issues. The good news is that these techniques are relatively easy to understand. In the information age, understanding basic econometric techniques has become part of economic literacy. My view is that while graduate students in economics must learn to use econometric techniques in a creative way, undergraduate students should learn to understand these techniques and to understand research results based on these techniques.

We also use the concepts to explain the covariation between two different statistical distributions and measures of this covariation such as the covariance, correlation coefficients, and regression analysis.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development Review Questions 1. In this exercise, we examine the adverse selection issue discussed in the chapter. Call a s the share of safe projects and (1 a s ) the share of risky projects. Assume that a safe project yields a return of R s with 100% probability. Assume that a risky project yields a return of R r with probability p r and a return of 0 with probability (1 p r ). Assume that the lender has perfect information about which projects are safe and which are risky. What is the minimum interest rate necessary to recover a loan of 1 with the safe project? What is the minimum interest rate necessary to recover a loan of 1 with the risky project? Assume that the lender cannot recognize which loans are safe and which are risky. What, then, is the minimum interest rate the bank must charge in order to recover a loan of 1? Above what interest rate would the safe projects stop demanding a loan? 2. This is an exercise on moral hazard in credit markets. Assume that a borrower must borrow 100 for an investment. The borrower can choose between a safe project yielding a return of R s with 100% probability and a risky project yielding a return of R r with probability p r and a return of 0 with probability (1 p r ). Assume that the lender cannot observe or control the type of project chosen by the borrower. What are the conditions for the borrower to choose the risky over the safe project under limited liability? What is the minimum level of collateral that will lead the borrower to choose the safe project instead? Alternatively, assume that the borrower has some money of his or her own to invest in the project that costs 100. Assuming that the bank cannot collateralize the loan, what is the maximum amount of the loan such that the borrower will prefer the safe over the risky project? 3. Take the same assumptions as in the previous exercise on the returns and probabilities associated with the safe and risky projects. Assume that there are monitoring costs C to make sure the borrower chooses the safe over the risky project. If L is the size of the loan, what is the minimum interest rate the bank must charge as a function of the size of the loan and the monitoring costs? 4. This is an exercise on microcredit as a substitute for collateral. Take the same assumptions as in the previous two exercises on the safe and risky projects. Now assume that there are two borrowers, A and B. Assume that the size of the loan is 1 and that the interest rate is r. Also assume that A has limited liability. What is the minimum size of B’s liability in case A defaults on his loan, so that B can convince A to choose the safe loan? 5.

Econometric Appendix mathematical expectation of X. The expectations operator has some mathematical properties which are useful: First of all, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expectations: E ( X + Y ) = E ( X ) + E ( Y ) Second, the expectation of the sum of a random variable and a constant is equal to that constant plus the expectation of the random variable: E ( X + c ) = E ( X ) + c . Third, the expectation of a random variable multiplied by a constant is equal to that constant multiplied by the expectation of the random variable: E ( aX ) = aE ( X ) These properties are useful because the expectations operator is an operator that is used quite often in performing calculations on random variables. As stated above, when measuring a variable such as height, we never have the luxury of observing the distribution of the whole population (and because the expectation is a function of the true distribution, we do not observe the true mean height). Instead, we draw samples. Let us say we take the height of n men drawn at random. We will have observations: x 1 , x 2 , c , x n . 1 We can calculate the mean of the sample defined as follows: x = 1 n a n i = 1 x i The mean of a sample, x , drawn at random, is an approximation of E ( X ) . The larger the sample n, the better the approximation and the more precise the estimation. It is very important, however, that we draw the sample at random. Otherwise, the mean of the sample might be a biased estimate of E ( X ) . Suppose, for example, that we picked the tallest men in a crowd. The sample would be biased for that reason and the mean height of the samples of men’s heights would likely be higher than E ( X ) . Another very important notion is that of conditional expectation , the expected value of a stochastic variable, conditional on the distribution of another variable. Instead of asking what the average height of men is, we could ask what the expected height is, conditional on age. This is noted E ( X H age). Expected height will be different for a 10-year-old boy than for a 20-year-old man. Another important property of a distribution is its variance . It is a measure of how much variation there is in the true distribution. It is noted Var( X ) , or s 2 x , and is equal to E [ X E ( X )] 2 . 1 Throughout this appendix, we note random variables with capital letters X or Y and observations with lowercase letters and an observation-specific index such as x i and y i . In some cases, random variables will also be indexed when necessary for better comprehension.

Econometric Appendix How does the variance s 2 x relate to the average of the distribution m x ? Let us do some operations using the properties of the expectations operator. Var( X ) = E [ X E ( X )] 2 = E [( X E ( X ))( X E ( X ))] = E [( X 2 2 X . E ( X )) + ( E ( X ) 2 ] = E ( X 2 ) 2 m x E ( X ) + E ( m x ) 2 = E ( X 2 ) 2 m x 2 + m x 2 = E ( X 2 ) m x 2 Note that we made use of the fact that m x is a constant. Therefore, 2 E ( X . E ( X )) = 2 m x E ( X ) and E ( m x ) 2 = m x 2 . A useful property that we can easily derive is the following ( a and b are constant parameters): Var( aX + b ) = a 2 Var( X ) To know the true variance of the distribution, we would again need to know the whole distribution. This is usually impossible and therefore we calculate a variance from the random sample that we drew. The usual formula for the variance of a sample is: s x 2 = 1 n a n i = 1 ( x i x ) 2 = 1 n a n i = 1 x 2 i x 2 The variance is the sum of the squares of the deviation of an observation from its mean divided by n. We take the square because some deviations are positive and others are negative. By adding up deviations without squaring them, they could cancel out and not give a true picture of the variation in the distribution. An average squared deviation is, however, not necessarily easy to interpret. The standard deviation s x is the square root of the variance. It gives a rough idea of the average deviation of data from the mean and thus has an intuitive interpretation. Covariation between Two Variables Now that we have an idea of the basic properties of a single variable, we can introduce concepts that relate one variable to another. The covariance between two variables, say X and Y, gives us an idea of how much two variables move together. It is defined in the following way: Cov( X , Y ) = E [( X m x )( Y m Y )] Again, using the properties of the expectations operator, we get: Cov( X , Y ) = E [ XY X m Y m x Y + m x m Y ] = E ( XY ) m x m Y Note again that we used the properties of the expectations operator in order to calculate the formula. Note also that if X and Y are statistically independent, then E ( XY ) = E ( X ) E ( Y ) = m x m Y and thus Cov( X , Y ) = 0.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries like to have unbiased estimates of the returns to education in order to evaluate correctly the payoff of aid and resources put into education. How can we solve this problem? Esther Duflo developed a smart, unbiased method for estimating the returns to education. 2 She exploited a large-scale program of school construction in Indonesia from 1973 to 1974 and from 1978 to 1979. As one of the world’s oil producers, Indonesia benefited from the sudden increase in revenues following these two big oil booms in the 1970s and spent part of its oil revenues on a vast expansion of school buildings. A total of 61,000 schools were built between 1974 and 1978. This addition to the total number of schools represents roughly 2 schools per 1,000 children aged 5 to 14 in 1971. This very sizeable program had a major effect on primary-school enrollment rates, which, for children ages 7 to 12, increased from 69% in 1973 to 83% in 1978. The school construction program represents a good opportunity to study the returns to education. Children who were older than 12 in 1974 did not benefit from the program, but children who were younger than 12 in the same locality did. We can thus compare the returns to education of those who were able to benefit from the program using the returns of those who were not. Estimating returns to education this way is close to what we would obtain if we could randomly educate some children and not others. Indeed, the windfall oil revenues were completely exogenous to the circumstances of the Indonesian children. Some were lucky to benefit from the school expansion program because they were the right age at the right time, while others were unfortunately born earlier. Another fact that helps to identify the beneficiaries of the construction program is that some regions received more schools than others. These were regions where primary school enrollment was traditionally lower; as a result, the construction program was more intensive in these regions. Table 7 shows the estimate of the returns to education using information about Indonesia’s school construction program. It is based on the method of difference in differences . The first row in panel A has data on years of education and the log of wages for children ages 2-6 in 1974 who benefited from the program. The row below has data on those ages 12-17 in 1974 who did not benefit from the program. Moreover, individuals were classified according to whether or not they lived in regions where there was a higher rate of school construction. The average number of schools built per thousand children in the higher-rate regions was 2.44 compared to 1.54 in the lower-rate regions. As we can see, children who benefited from the program in higherrate regions received an average of 8.49 years of education compared to 8.02 for those who did not benefit from it. There is thus an average difference of 0.47, roughly half a year more of education for the children who benefited from the program in those regions. In the regions where the construction rate was lower, the difference is only 0.36 more years. Note, however, that in those 2 Esther Duflo, “Schooling and Labor Market Consequences of School Construction in Indonesia: Evidence from an Unusual Policy Experiment,” The American Economic Review 91, no. 4 (2001): 795-813. 


Delivering Education in Developing Countries like to have unbiased estimates of the returns to education in order to evaluate correctly the payoff of aid and resources put into education. How can we solve this problem? Esther Duflo developed a smart, unbiased method for estimating the returns to education. 2 She exploited a large-scale program of school construction in Indonesia from 1973 to 1974 and from 1978 to 1979. As one of the world’s oil producers, Indonesia benefited from the sudden increase in revenues following these two big oil booms in the 1970s and spent part of its oil revenues on a vast expansion of school buildings. A total of 61,000 schools were built between 1974 and 1978. This addition to the total number of schools represents roughly 2 schools per 1,000 children aged 5 to 14 in 1971. This very sizeable program had a major effect on primary-school enrollment rates, which, for children ages 7 to 12, increased from 69% in 1973 to 83% in 1978. The school construction program represents a good opportunity to study the returns to education. Children who were older than 12 in 1974 did not benefit from the program, but children who were younger than 12 in the same locality did. We can thus compare the returns to education of those who were able to benefit from the program using the returns of those who were not.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries Using the difference in differences results from Table 7, we can conclude that the Indonesian school construction program led to an increase in the average years of schooling of 0.12 years. 3 The estimated return per year of education obtained this way would thus be the wage increase divided by the difference in average years of schooling: 2. %/.12 = 21. %. This is somewhat lower than the 26% return generally estimated in the literature. A useful exercise is provided in panel B of Table 7. Two age groups are compared: those ages 12-17 in 1974 and those ages 18-24 in 1974. Because neither of those two groups benefited from the program, we should not find any real effect either on average years of schooling or on earnings. Indeed, looking at the difference in difference for years of schooling, the result is 0.013 years and the difference in differences for wages is 0. %. These estimates are much smaller. Moreover, they are not statistically significant. Even though the results of the study provide somewhat lower estimates of the return to education compared to previous studies, the difference is not extremely large. The selection bias from the traditional studies on the returns to education does not appear to be too significant. However, we need many more studies in the Duflo style to measure the returns to education in developing countries more accurately. Institutions and Education in Developing Countries Our discussion now turns to some issues related to institutions in the context of education in developing countries. An important question is that of child labor, which is very prevalent in developing countries. Should child labor be banned so that all children can go to school instead of being sent to work by their families? We also discuss the role of India’s caste system in education. Why Is There Child Labor and Should It Be Banned? Child labor is still a stark reality in many developing countries. Instead of sending their children to school to get an education, many parents in poor households make their children work on the family farm or send them to work in factories or in the service sector to earn a living to supplement their family’s meager income. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), 120 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 work full time and 130 million work half time. That makes 250 million children who work instead of going to school. Of those 250 million, roughly 153 million are in Asia, 80 million are in Africa, and 17 million are in Latin America. In terms of percentages, 41% of children between 5 and 14 in Africa work and the corresponding figures for Asia and Latin America are, respectively, 21% and 17%. Child labor is often blamed on the parents. Children can only obey their parents, but forfeiting an education in order to supplement the household’s income severely limits their opportunities in life. Many people in the West are 3 Note that in Table 7, this difference is not statistically different from zero, but in more sophisticated regressions, Duflo does find a statistically significant effect of the school construction program.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries analyzed the effect of globalization on educational choices in Mumbai, given the traditional caste institutions. 6 They found that those disadvantaged under the traditional institutions, in particular girls from lower castes, were able to switch much faster to English-language education when the returns to that education increased dramatically in the 1990s. Worker occupations in large cities like Mumbai have traditionally been divided into sub-castes, the jati. By custom, male networks dominated the labor market as women were confined to domestic chores. Munshi and Rosenzweig analyzed school choices between an education in English or in Marathi, the local language, for boys and girls between 1982 and 2001 in the different jatis. In the 1990s, the returns to English education increased quite strongly for both men and women, with increases over 50%. Figures 4a and 4b show the evolution of the proportion of children over time receiving an English-language education among high-, medium-, and low-caste children. Several striking facts from the study emerge. First of all, the share of an English-language education increases as the returns to it increase (starting from 1991 in Figures 4a and 4b). This is true for all castes. Second, the proportion of high-caste children receiving an English-language education is, in general, higher, which is not surprising given the fact that English has traditionally been the language of the elite in India.

Corruption Remarkably, Fisman and Miguel found a pattern of parking violation among the diplomats that strongly correlated to the subjective measures of corruption discussed earlier in this chapter. Figure 2 shows, on the vertical axis, the relation between the log of a country’s annual per diplomat New York City parking violations and, on the horizontal axis, the World Bank country corruption measure (a higher score in the figure means more corruption because the index for control of corruption was inverted by the researchers). 24 The relationship is quite strong and gives some reassurance about the use of the subjective perception indices. On the other hand, it also shows that culture matters for corruption. As a result, cultural factors play a very important role when compared to other institutional factors. Note that the relation between the World Bank corruption index and parking violations holds when controlling for income per capita, the number of cars registered with different consulates, and other control variables. Note also that as diplomats stayed longer in New York, those from countries with a high tolerance for corruption had more parking violations over time, while those from countries with a low tolerance also tended to have more violations, but with a lower rate of increase. This suggests that even though diplomats knew that parking violations would go unpunished, cultural norms still played an important role in predicting the number of parking violations a particular diplomat incurred. 24 Because this is a log, 1 is added to the number of violations so as to avoid the log taking very negative values and, possibly, minus infinity in case there are no violations.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries over time, the effects of the caste system will become more diluted as the Indian economy continues its integration into the global economy. Only time will tell. What Reforms Can Improve Education? Much needs to be done to improve education in developing countries. How should a poor nation use its scarce resources more efficiently to improve the quality of education? There have been many exciting initiatives in recent years that address that question. Some initiatives involved preventing teacher absenteeism and improving teacher incentives and the organization of public education. Various other programs have aimed at reducing the costs of schooling, whether by vouchers giving free access to better-quality private schools or by subsidies for textbooks, school breakfasts, uniforms, and the like. Other initiatives aimed to improve the educational gender gap. Many of these programs have been analyzed and evaluated with state-of-the-art econometric techniques, and in recent years, this has made development economics one of the most exciting fields of research in economics. Fighting Teacher Absenteeism As we saw earlier in this chapter, teacher absenteeism is a widespread problem in many developing countries. It is damaging for the children’s education and represents a waste of scarce resources. Various NGOs have come up with programs to prevent teacher absence. In India, a randomized experiment using camera monitoring was implemented by the NGO, Seva Mandir, in the rural Udaipur district. Before the program was implemented, an inspection done in 2003 revealed a teacher absence rate of 44%, which is extremely high compared to the figures shown in Table 6. In 60 randomly selected schools, the organization gave the teacher a camera, with instructions to take a picture every day of him- or herself and the students at the beginning and end of the school day. The cameras had a tamper-proof date and time stamp. An incentive system was established with a bonus (or penalty) of 5% per day present (or absent) relative to a benchmark of 21 days of attendance per month. In other words, for every day a teacher attended school above 21 days, he or she received a bonus, while for every day of absence below that threshold there was a penalty. In 60 other schools, a more traditional method was used: teachers were threatened with dismissal if found to be absent and monthly unannounced visits were organized to measure the teacher absence. Esther Duflo and Rema Hanna evaluated that program and found that in the schools with the camera monitoring treatment, the absence rate was cut in half. 7 The program eliminated extreme absenteeism (teachers who rarely ever showed up) and also increased the number of teachers with a perfect attendance record. As a result, children gained one-third more teaching days. How cost effective is such a camera monitoring program? Duflo and Hanna found that the costs of the bonuses for additional attendance were nearly offset 7 Esther Duflo and Rema Hanna, “Monitoring Works: Getting Teachers to Come to School” (working paper 11880, National Bureau of Economic Research, 2005).

Mobutu Sese Seko (1930-1997) was president of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) between 1965 and 1997. He holds the sad record of having been the most corrupt leader in Africa. During his years in power, he is said to have stolen or embezzled US$5 billion, most of it placed in Swiss bank accounts. In the first years of his presidency, he diverted money given by U.S. government agencies and Western powers to support his fight against rebel movements backed by the Soviet Union. Later, he received kickbacks from royalties paid to Zaire by foreign companies that extracted the country’s natural resources. He went on to accept bribes from any major business deal in Zaire. In later years, he personally diverted a significant portion of the government budget to his own accounts. During his administration, the country became impoverished. Roads were neither built nor repaired, leading to a collapse of the country’s transport infrastructure. The education system was left in ruins. The country had a wealth of natural resources such as copper, uranium, gold, and diamonds, but their extraction never benefited the population. When Mobutu was overthrown in 1997, income per capita in the country was a mere $160, roughly two-thirds less than when he seized power. Unfortunately, Mobutu was not the only corrupt leader in a developing country; others include Mohammed Suharto, the president of Indonesia between 1967 and 1998; Ferdinand Marcos, the president of the Philippines between 1966 and 1986; JeanClaude Duvalier, the president of Haiti between 1971 and 1986; and Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru between 1990 and 2000. T he topic of corruption has become increasingly important in all discussions of development and foreign aid. There is a large body of evidence that significant amounts of foreign aid have been diverted because of corruption, though it is difficult to give exact figures. 1 The extent of corruption in a country is an indicator of the quality of its institutions. One of the main themes in development economics, and in this book, is that institutions are key to encouraging or, instead, hampering development. Corruption involves the misuse of public office for private gain. Corrupt activities are not only illegal, but they are also covert in order to avoid detection. 2 Corrupt contracts are not legally enforceable. Because corrupt activities are clandestine, they imply minimal or no transparency in public and administrative 1 See, for example, William R. Easterly, The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists’ Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002). 2 Some corrupt activities that are illegal in certain countries are legal in others. For example, this is the case for laws regulating political campaign contributions, which vary greatly across countries. Some countries have very strict limits on campaign contributions while others do not. Corruption

In later years, he personally diverted a significant portion of the government budget to his own accounts. During his administration, the country became impoverished. Roads were neither built nor repaired, leading to a collapse of the country’s transport infrastructure. The education system was left in ruins. The country had a wealth of natural resources such as copper, uranium, gold, and diamonds, but their extraction never benefited the population. When Mobutu was overthrown in 1997, income per capita in the country was a mere $160, roughly two-thirds less than when he seized power. Unfortunately, Mobutu was not the only corrupt leader in a developing country; others include Mohammed Suharto, the president of Indonesia between 1967 and 1998; Ferdinand Marcos, the president of the Philippines between 1966 and 1986; JeanClaude Duvalier, the president of Haiti between 1971 and 1986; and Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru between 1990 and 2000. T he topic of corruption has become increasingly important in all discussions of development and foreign aid. There is a large body of evidence that significant amounts of foreign aid have been diverted because of corruption, though it is difficult to give exact figures. 1 The extent of corruption in a country is an indicator of the quality of its institutions. One of the main themes in development economics, and in this book, is that institutions are key to encouraging or, instead, hampering development. Corruption involves the misuse of public office for private gain. Corrupt activities are not only illegal, but they are also covert in order to avoid detection. 2 Corrupt contracts are not legally enforceable. Because corrupt activities are clandestine, they imply minimal or no transparency in public and administrative 1 See, for example, William R. Easterly, The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists’ Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002). 2 Some corrupt activities that are illegal in certain countries are legal in others. For example, this is the case for laws regulating political campaign contributions, which vary greatly across countries. Some countries have very strict limits on campaign contributions while others do not. Corruption 


Delivering Education in Developing Countries Review Questions 1. How can we measure the gross enrollment rate in education? Why can it sometimes be higher than 100%? How can we correct it and calculate a net enrollment rate? 2. What are the usual estimates of returns to education in developing countries? How can we measure these returns? What is the potential problem with simple OLS (ordinary least squares) regression of wages on education? How does Esther Duflo’s research in Indonesia avoid this problem? 3. Teacher incentives can be enhanced by giving them bonuses if their students do well in test scores. Discuss. What was the experience with teacher incentives in Kenya? Do some research on the same topic for other countries. 4. What is the experience in developing countries with parent involvement and bottom-up monitoring of schools? 5. Programs to reduce the costs of schooling lead to higher participation rates for girls than for boys. How do you explain this? How does it relate to the education gender gap? How does it relate to gender preferences of parents? 6. Private net returns to education could be negative. Use the data in Figure 3 on human capital investment discussed in this chapter to show how this can be the case. Why might this be the case? 7.

Econometric Appendix We thus see that if Cov( S, A ) is positive for example, the estimate of the effect of schooling will be biased upward. Omitting variables in a regression can thus result in a biased estimate. In relation to the assumptions of OLS regression, this bias will be due to the fact that we violate the assumption that the error term is uncorrelated with the dependent variable. Indeed, if A is an omitted variable, the error term will pick up the ability variable. Indeed, the error term from the wrong model estimating earnings on schooling, Y a b S , will be equal to g A + e . If A is correlated with S, that is, if cov(S, A) is different from zero, then the assumption of the OLS model of noncorrelation between the error term and the dependent variable will be violated. The omitted variable problem is a very serious one and researchers are likely to encounter this problem very frequently. Panel Regressions When performing regressions, we often have two kinds of data series: crosssectional data and times-series data. Cross-sectional data will analyze a phenomenon across individuals, regions, or countries for a specific time period. If, for example, we try to understand the effect of a malaria vaccine on individuals’ health, we will have a regression of the form presented above: y i = a + r d i + b x i + h i , where y i is the outcome observation for individual i, x i is the control variable observation for that individual, and d i is the observation for the treatment dummy variable. The variation in the data is across individuals indexed by i. The health measure of individuals is likely to have taken place some time after the malaria treatment, but the variation in the data is across individuals. A times series analysis would be one in which we would, for example, follow the health of an individual before and after the malaria treatment, possibly over a number of years. All variables would be for the same individual, but across time. The regression would then have the following form: y t = a + r d t + b x t + h t As we can see, here the variation in the data is variation across time indexed by t. The dummy for the treatment would take a value of 0 before the treatment and a value of 1 after the treatment. Control variable observations x t would be for the same individual across time and so would the health measures. In some cases, we are lucky to have data including both cross-sectional and time variation. These are called panel data and we can analyze them with panel data regression. In terms of our example, we could analyze the health of many different individuals over time to analyze the effect of the malaria treatment. The typical panel data regression would then take the following form: y it = a i + a H t + r d it + b x it + h it

Corruption certainly consider them to be morally and ethically wrong, we will not focus on these cases in this chapter. Note that corruption need not involve bribery. According to our definition, a tax collector who steals part of the revenues he collects is guilty of corruption. He does not receive bribes but diverts public funds. A borderline case would be a politician who receives illegal contributions to finance his party’s election campaign. If the politician takes some of this money for his own use, it is an obvious case of corruption, but if all the money goes into the party’s campaign fund, does this fit our definition of corruption as there is no obvious direct private financial enrichment? We can argue that this is a form of corruption because eventually the party and its elected officials can reap private gains from this activity. Indeed, if one political party engages in illegal campaign financing while others do not, this activity may give the party an unfair competitive edge that can result in an electoral victory. Party leaders will then garner personal benefits from an illegal activity, which qualifies as corruption. Whether specific political leaders directly benefit from these funds is rarely the primary issue in trials that focus on illicit campaign financing. A case that does not fit the definition of corruption is clientelism or particularistic spending. This occurs when politicians give favors to particular voter groups in exchange for their electoral support. These favors often take the form of government jobs or public works projects in the voters’ districts. In the United States, this is called pork-barrel spending. Particularistic spending may be associated with corruption; a firm that receives the contract for a public works project may give kickbacks to politicians who approved the project. However, we will not include particularistic spending in our definition of corruption. Sometimes corruption is also confused with rent-seeking , trying to influence politicians in order to obtain economic favors. While corruption can be seen as a form of rent-seeking, this practice is not necessarily corrupt. In a democracy, rent-seeking is perfectly normal as different interest groups try to advance their interests. This is unavoidable and it would be naïve to think that rent-seeking could be eliminated. However, institutional rules can ensure that rent-seeking activities take place in a transparent and legal context. As we mentioned above, because corruption involves breaking the law, corrupt activities will also be covert and because of this, their consequences will be hidden, as well. The more corruption there is, the less transparency there will be in government decisions. Measuring Corruption How can we measure corruption? Because it is a covert activity, it might seem that trying to measure it would be a hopeless endeavor that is necessarily doomed to fail. Moreover, not all acts of corruption are equal. A routine bribe to a policeman who will “fix” a traffic ticket is not the equivalent of a politician who pays criminal elements to eliminate a political opponent or to organize large-scale electoral fraud. Corruption at a higher level of power is considered more egregious than petty corruption. There are two main methods used to measure corruption: objective measures quantify observed acts of corruption while subjective measures evaluate perceptions of corruption by those who are either confronted with it or with its consequences.

Corruption acceptable to pay and receive bribes. It may also be due to very low wages for civil servants, as well as bad governance and inadequate selection of civil servants, among other causes. Moreover, it is also difficult to distinguish between the causes and the consequences of corruption. Development and Corruption One of the strongest correlations we find in all studies of corruption is the link between development and corruption. Countries with a lower GDP per capita tend to have a higher level of corruption. There are several interpretations of this finding: one is that poverty tends to breed corruption; another is that corruption is bad for development; a third and perhaps more plausible interpretation is that there are certain underlying variables such as institutions that cause both more corruption and less development. In an article synthetizing the causes of corruption found in the literature, Daniel Treisman highlighted the correlation between contemporary measures of corruption (the World Bank’s measure of control of corruption mentioned above) and GDP per capita going as far back as 1820. 13 Table 1 shows the correlation Treisman found between economic historian Angus Maddison’s series of GDP per capita since 1500 and control of corruption in 2005. The p-value is a statistical indicator for the probability that the coefficient is equal to zero. The lower the p-value is, the higher the probability that the coefficient is significantly different from zero. Table 1 shows that until 1700, there is no correlation between income per capita and corruption today. However, income per capita in 1820 is already correlated with control of corruption today and the correlation is very significant. This means that richer countries in 1820 were likely to be less corrupt today. The correlation is quite striking and suggests that there are long-term effects at play in the determination of corruption. It is plausible that these effects could be related to institutions rather than to short-term policies. Of course, we must keep in mind that the rich countries in 1820 are still the rich countries today; in other words, the ranking of different countries’ income has not changed significantly over time. 13 Daniel Treisman, “The Causes of Corruption: A Cross-National Study,” Journal of Public Economics 76, no. 3 (2000): 399-457. 1500 1600 1700 1820 1900 1950 World Bank control of corruption 2005 0.47 0.145 0.228 .599 ** .791 ** .441 ** p-value .835 .52 .308 .000 .000 .000 Number of countries 22 22 22 46 42 146 There is a correlation between corruption in 2005 and the level of development in 1950, 1900, and even as far back as 1820.

Econometric Appendix malaria treatment was administered as well as economic improvements that affect people’s health positively. Those variables would not be well captured in the fixed effect. To repeat, when there are time-varying unobserved variables, fixed effects cannot capture them appropriately. Is there a way we could pick up the effect of time-varying omitted variables? If there are unobserved variables that vary over time in a similar way for all individuals (say that they vary in sync with the business cycle, for example), then time fixed effects can capture those variables. Time fixed effects can be dummy variables for years or months, depending on the frequency of collection of the observations. This is the role played by a H t in the panel regression on the previous page. When estimating a panel regression, we can estimate the first difference of the dependent variable: h y it = h a H t + r h d it + b h x it + h h it Note that the individual fixed effect has been eliminated because it is time invariant. To the extent that the omitted variables are correctly assumed to be time invariant, the first difference regression will give us the same result as with a panel regression with individual fixed effects. Panel regressions are also very useful to estimate difference-in-differences effects. What is a difference-in-differences estimation ? It is an econometric technique to estimate a treatment effect, exploiting data before and after a particular treatment. Let us assume that there are two time periods, t = 1, 2, at which surveys are done. Assume that the treatment and its effects occur in period 2. Assume that the true model has the following form (we leave out the indices assuming that the model is the same across individuals): Y = a + r D + b X + h If the treatment has not been done in a randomized way, we can use the fact that it occurred in period 2 and use the survey from period 1. Because there was no treatment in period 1, the true equation for period 1 should be: Y = a + b X + h Let us take our first period sample and separate it between those who were treated one period later and those who were not. We can then estimate r , using the difference between the two periods and the difference between the treatment and the control group. Calling the OLS estimate r n 1 , we get: r n 1 = E ( Y H D 2 = 1) E ( Y H D 2 = 0) = a + b E ( X H D 2 = 1) + E ( h H D 2 = 1) a b E ( X H D 2 = 0) E ( h H D 2 = 0) = b E ( X H D 2 = 1) b E ( X H D 2 = 0) 


Econometric Appendix malaria treatment was administered as well as economic improvements that affect people’s health positively. Those variables would not be well captured in the fixed effect. To repeat, when there are time-varying unobserved variables, fixed effects cannot capture them appropriately. Is there a way we could pick up the effect of time-varying omitted variables? If there are unobserved variables that vary over time in a similar way for all individuals (say that they vary in sync with the business cycle, for example), then time fixed effects can capture those variables. Time fixed effects can be dummy variables for years or months, depending on the frequency of collection of the observations. This is the role played by a H t in the panel regression on the previous page. When estimating a panel regression, we can estimate the first difference of the dependent variable: h y it = h a H t + r h d it + b h x it + h h it Note that the individual fixed effect has been eliminated because it is time invariant. To the extent that the omitted variables are correctly assumed to be time invariant, the first difference regression will give us the same result as with a panel regression with individual fixed effects.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries by the penalties for absence. Note that bonuses and penalties were set relative to the benchmark of 21 days, which was an above-average attendance rate before the program was introduced. Otherwise, there might have been a cost in terms of higher bonuses. As a result, the only real cost was the cost of the cameras. Duflo and Hanna evaluated the cost of the program at $6 per student per year. This seemed quite cost effective. In contrast, because of the long distances between schools in the area, monitoring by unannounced visits is relatively expensive and is also not as effective in fighting absence, as the research has shown. A different program to fight absenteeism was implemented in Kenya by International Child Support, another NGO. The headmasters of schools selected to participate in the program were asked to monitor teachers and received money to reward the good attendance records of teachers in their schools. The teacher with the best attendance record would win a bicycle at the end of the term. It was found that headmasters tended to over-report the presence of teachers in order to deliver the prize. There was thus collusion between headmasters and teachers, which is not too surprising. Note that the absence rate of headmasters also tends to be high. The lesson from the Kenyan program is that rules that can be bent work less effectively. The impersonal system of camera monitoring, because it creates a daily record and cannot be tampered with, tends to work better. Are Incentives for Teachers Effective? It is a commonly held view that education would be improved if teachers were incentivized, that is, if their salaries were dependent on the results of their teaching. Because students in many countries take various forms of standardized tests, it is possible to compare the results of one teacher’s pupils with those of other teachers, making it feasible to evaluate teachers’ performance and give teachers a bonus that increases with the positive test results of their pupils, or to offer them some other reward related to their pupils’ test scores. Paul Glewwe, Michael Kremer, and Sylvie Moulin analyzed a program in Kenya that gave prizes to teachers whose pupils did well in tests. 8 The researchers found that the program encouraged teachers to do more practice sessions in preparation for tests. However, they also found no improvement in teacher attendance, nor did they find any reduction in student dropout rates or any changes in pedagogy and teaching methods. This is not really surprising and we would be wrong to think that economists would, in general, be in favor of incentivized pay for teachers. Economists were actually among the first to point out its dangers. In 1991, Bengt Holmström and Paul Milgrom showed that incentives based on the test results of pupils distorted teacher incentives instead of improving teaching. 9 Most of 8 Paul Glewwe, Michael Kremer, and Sylvie Moulin, “Textbooks and Test Scores: Evidence from a Prospective Evaluation in Kenya,” Policy Research Group, The World Bank, 2001. 9 Bengt Holmström and Paul Milgrom, “Multitask Principal-Agent Analyses: Incentive Contracts, Asset Ownership, and Job Design,” Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization 7 (special issue, papers from the Conference on the New Science of Organization, January 1991): 24-52.

Corruption Objective Measures of Corruption The most obvious objective measure of corruption is to count the number of criminal indictments for corruption. This can, however, be tricky because a country with fewer indictments for corruption can, in some cases, be more corrupt than one with numerous indictments. Indeed, fewer indictments can either mean that there is no corruption or that there is so much corruption that the country’s police and judicial system do not prosecute those responsible. Thus, counting the number of indictments for corruption might not accurately reflect the actual degree of corruption. Not all objective measures of corruption necessarily suffer from bad measurement. There are revealing objective corruption data for specific countries. For example, during the presidency of Alberto Fujimori in Peru, the head of the secret police, Vladimiro Montesinos, kept a very detailed record of all the bribes paid by the Fujimori administration to politicians, judges, and the media (see the box on page 514). There are other studies that also give us objective measures of corruption. For example, Benjamin Olken measured corruption in road construction in Indonesia by comparing the reported costs of the construction that were provided by local village authorities to the estimated costs that he received from independent engineers and surveyors. 3 He estimated that 24% of the construction funds had been diverted. Ritva Reinikka and Jakob Svensson studied corruption in the Ugandan educational system. 4 They compared the flows disbursed by the central government to the school districts with surveys done of the actual receipt of cash and supplies in those schools. They found that between 1991 and 1995, the schools received only 13% of the central government money they were promised. The rest of the money was apparently diverted by local officials and politicians. Rafael Di Tella and Ernesto Schargrodsky analyzed corruption in procurement for hospitals in Buenos Aires. 5 They found that prices for basic hospital inputs fell by 15% after a crackdown on corruption in 1996-1997, suggesting that the prices before the crackdown had been inflated because of corruption. Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti have also proposed estimates of the corruption related to the UN Oil for Food Program under Saddam Hussein. 6 This program was established after the first Gulf War to try to alleviate the suffering populace hurt by the post-war sanctions placed on Iraq. Under that program, the proceeds from the sale of Iraqi oil did not go directly to the Iraqi government, but into an escrow account. The use of that money was to be supervised by UN authorities. Hsieh and Moretti compared the official selling price of Iraqi oil with estimates of its market price. They then constructed an 3 Benjamin Olken, “Monitoring Corruption: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Indonesia,” Journal of Political Economy 115, no. 2 (2007): 200-249. 4 Ritva Reinikka and Jakob Svensson, “Local Capture: Evidence from a Central Government Transfer Program in Uganda,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 119, no. 2 (2004): 679-705. 6 Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti, “Did Iraq Cheat the United Nations?

Delivering Education in Developing Countries what a teacher does to educate children is not observable. If teachers’ pay becomes dependent on test results, then teachers will allocate much more effort preparing their pupils for tests and divert a lot of effort away from the non-observable part of teaching. Paying teachers for test results leads to “teaching to the test” without necessarily improving overall education. The message from the research by Holmström and Milgrom is that if a job involves multiple tasks, some of which are observable (or whose results are directly observable such as tests) and some of which are not, conditioning the pay on the observable results will lead to diverting effort away from the nonobservable tasks to the observable tasks. In that case, it might be better not to introduce incentive payments in order to avoid such distortions of effort. Most parents will prefer that their children be well educated rather than only well prepared for tests. Decentralization School systems are often very centralized. This is not surprising; the objective of most education systems is to give equal education to children, which means that the curricula and school administration are often centralized at the national level. However, while centralization has benefits, it also has disadvantages, one of which is that the monitoring of teachers is done only from above. If parents are dissatisfied with some aspect of their children’s schooling, they cannot do much about it as their complaints would have to reach the higher levels of the school’s administration and, as a result, would have less of a chance to be heard. Some countries have encouraged the decentralization of education in order to allow more control from below with the hope of improving the quality of teaching. In some countries, local education committees have been set up that include parent participation to monitor and partially reward teachers. One such initiative is the EDUCO program (Educacion con Participacion de la Comunidad) in El Salvador in Central America. From 1980 until 1992, El Salvador experienced a bloody civil war and public education was disrupted, especially in rural areas. In response, local communities decided to take charge of the local schools, often with considerable success. In 1991, El Salvador’s Ministry of Education decided to draw on this experience to expand primary education in rural areas by establishing the EDUCO program. The EDUCO schools are managed autonomously by community associations of elected parents. These associations play a key role in school management; they sign contracts with the teachers and maintain the schools. Research by the World Bank on the results of the EDUCO program found that while it was successful in expanding education, student performance was no better than in traditional schools. However, teacher absenteeism was somewhat lower. 10 While EDUCO is deemed a relative success, the results of other such decentralization efforts are, in general, mixed, if not outright disappointing.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries example, Edward Miguel and Mary Kay Gugerty found that on the basis of a study in Tanzania and Kenya, there is a strong collective-action problem in ethnically heterogeneous communities. 11 These communities collect less money for schools, there is less community participation, and various indicators such as textbook availability and school maintenance suggest a lower quality of education in these heterogeneous communities. In Kenya, ICS, the NGO mentioned above, experimented with parent participation. A school committee composed of parents was supposed to give a prize for the best teacher. Parents were given guidance about the criteria for choosing the best teacher. Michael Kremer and Christel Vermeersch found that the results were disappointing: no positive effects were found either on teacher absenteeism or on the children’s school performance. 12 Decentralization and control from below may work in some communities, but there is no guarantee that it will because local communities must first resolve their collective-action problems. Moreover, parents in rural communities are often illiterate and not well prepared to judge the quality of teaching. Vouchers Voucher programs for education have their advocates and opponents all over the world. The idea behind school vouchers is to create competition between private and public schools, and between different schools in general, by giving parents the option to choose their child’s school, whether private or public, by using government-financed school vouchers. The idea is that if parents have more school choices, competition for admission between schools will create incentives to improve the quality of schooling in poorly performing public schools and improve the general level of education. In the context of developing countries, the voucher idea is less applicable. School competition is limited in rural areas because children do not have a real choice of schools. There is only one school they can go to and they often have to walk quite a distance to do so. However, in urban environments, competition between schools is possible and various voucher programs have been implemented. We discuss two such programs, one in Colombia and one in Chile. Joshua Angrist, Eric Bettinger, and Michael Kremer examined the Colombian program. 13 Vouchers were distributed by lottery to 125,000 students, creating a random experiment so as to avoid any selection bias in the data. 14 Data were then 11 Edward Miguel and Mary Kay Gugerty, “Ethnic Diversity, Social Sanctions, and Public Goods in Kenya,” Journal of Public Economics 89, no. 11-12: 2325-2368. 12 Michael Kremer and Christel Vermeersch, “School Meals, Educational Achievement, and School Competition: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation (policy research working paper 3523, World Bank, 2005). 14 If people could have chosen to participate in the program, the more motivated parents would have made that choice and their children would probably also have performed better than average, thereby creating an upward bias in the results. 13 Joshua Angrist, Eric Bettinger, and Michael Kremer, “Long-Term Educational Consequences of Secondary School Vouchers: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia,” The American Economic Review 96, no. 3 (2005): 847-862.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development Microfinance Microfinance is an institutional innovation that has emerged in developing economies in response to the pervasiveness of credit constraints faced by small firms and poor households. Microfinance was featured in the news in 2006, when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank, a lending institution he created in Bangladeshi communities to provide microcredit, small loans to poor households and villages. Microcredit has been present for decades in many countries and has even spread to wealthy nations. There are many microcredit associations in the United States and globally, more than 10 million households benefit from microcredit. In 1976, while visiting the village of Jobra in Bangladesh, Yunus found that women who were producing bamboo furniture had to take out loans at very high interest rates to buy their bamboo. He then lent US$27 to 42 women in the village, a small sum, and was positively surprised to be repaid in time. In 1983, he founded the Grameen Bank with the purpose of providing small loans to the rural poor in Bangladeshi communities. The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh currently serves 5 million borrowers and it is interesting to note that the clients of the bank are primarily women. Microcredit is often seen as one of the success stories in development. It can finance the purchase of a cell phone, small tools, raw materials, seeds, livestock, and, more rarely, a car or a truck. The credit requested is often below $100, a relatively small sum for a loan. Microcredit is a very promising institutional innovation because it provides solutions to two of the most common financial problems present in developing economies: the absence of collateral and the high costs of monitoring small loans. How Does Microcredit Work? There are many different types of credit contracts offered by microcredit institutions around the world. These contracts share many common features, but can also have unique characteristics. One very important feature is that no collateral is required of borrowers. This is critical because, as we have discussed, collateral is not readily available in developing countries to curb moral hazard and to facilitate lending at low interest rates. A second and very important feature of microcredit is group lending . A bank approves a loan to a group of people in a village or neighborhood. The composition of the group is usually decided by the villagers or the residents of the neighborhood. The members of the group are then jointly responsible for paying back the loan. There are many variants of group lending; for example, one type provides specific loans only to certain people in a group, but all members of the group are liable for repayment. Say that 10 people have borrowed 100 each. If 1 of the 10 does not repay his or her loan, the nine others who have received loans have to pay an additional 100/9 each. This group responsibility imposes a discipline on the group and on each of its members, but for poor people the alternative to group lending is most often no loans at all. Group lending resolves both the lack of collateral and the monitoring problems. Group liability becomes a substitute for collateral. Even if individuals are

Microcredit is a very promising institutional innovation because it provides solutions to two of the most common financial problems present in developing economies: the absence of collateral and the high costs of monitoring small loans. How Does Microcredit Work? There are many different types of credit contracts offered by microcredit institutions around the world. These contracts share many common features, but can also have unique characteristics. One very important feature is that no collateral is required of borrowers. This is critical because, as we have discussed, collateral is not readily available in developing countries to curb moral hazard and to facilitate lending at low interest rates. A second and very important feature of microcredit is group lending . A bank approves a loan to a group of people in a village or neighborhood. The composition of the group is usually decided by the villagers or the residents of the neighborhood. The members of the group are then jointly responsible for paying back the loan. There are many variants of group lending; for example, one type provides specific loans only to certain people in a group, but all members of the group are liable for repayment. Say that 10 people have borrowed 100 each. If 1 of the 10 does not repay his or her loan, the nine others who have received loans have to pay an additional 100/9 each. This group responsibility imposes a discipline on the group and on each of its members, but for poor people the alternative to group lending is most often no loans at all. Group lending resolves both the lack of collateral and the monitoring problems. Group liability becomes a substitute for collateral. Even if individuals are 


Economic Growth that were disadvantaged by climate and geography should have always been poorer than the countries that were located in more fortunate places, but this is not the case. Before the 1500s, the Mughal civilization of India, the Aztecs in Mexico, and the Inca in Peru were among the most developed civilizations in the world. Now, those same regions are among the poorest in the world. In a well-known article, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson have documented a trend that they call “reversal of fortune,” in which there is a negative correlation between development in 1500 and development today. 21 We do not have measures of GDP per capita for 1500 because no one collected those statistics at the time. We have, however, rather good proxies for development, one of which is the level of urbanization. There has always been a relatively strong correlation between economic development and level of urbanization. In the past, only societies with a minimum level of productivity in agriculture and a well-developed system of commerce and transport could sustain large cities. Because agriculture is the basic source of food for a population, the more productive agriculture in a society is, the larger the fraction of the population that does not need to live off the land because farmers can produce enough for themselves and for those in the cities. Figure 5 shows the correlation between urbanization in 1500 in territories of what would later become European colonies and the log of GDP per capita in 1995 (PPP). Urbanization is measured as the fraction of the population living in urban centers of more than 5,000 inhabitants. GDP per capita is measured in logs to make the differences look smaller and also because differences in logs represent growth rates. In 1500, Europe had not yet started to colonize the world and to take over the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and large chunks of Asia. European colonization in the centuries that followed thoroughly destroyed American Indian civilizations such as the Aztec and the Inca. The slave trade in Africa also had a profoundly destructive effect on existing civilizations on that continent. 22 The most adverse affects of colonization by European powers were in those areas of the world that were the most economically developed. We can see a clear negative correlation between urbanization rates in 1500 and GDP per capita in 1995. A similar picture also emerges if development is measured by population density instead of by urbanization. This negative correlation suggests that colonization had, in the long run, a deeply adverse effect on the economic development of the colonized countries. This negative correlation sheds doubt on the idea that geography is the key to understanding differences in development. What are the causes of this reversal of fortune? The question leads us to another—and more promising— explanation for differences in development across the world: the role of institutions. Institutions and Growth Douglass North, Nobel Prize winner in economics, has argued for many years that institutions are the key to understanding why some countries developed earlier than others. Recent research has shown strong evidence of a causal link 21 Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson, “Reversal of Fortune: Geography and Institutions in the Making of Modern World Income Distribution,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 117, no. 4 (November 2002): 1231-1294. 22 See Nathan Nunn “The Long-Term Effects of Africa’s Slave Trades,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 123, no. 1 (2008): 139-176.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development including the cost of capital, are thus 110, which is larger than the revenues of 105. In this case, the bank would have operational sustainability but not financial sustainability. Looking again at Table 3, we see that all microfinance programs generate only 83% of the required amount to reach financial sustainability. Village banks and banks targeting the poorest borrowers generate roughly 70% of the necessary revenue. Banks that target a broader economic spectrum of customers have a better performance, as is the case with BancoSol in Bolivia and Bank Rakyat in Indonesia. Returns to the equity invested in the programs give us the same picture. Even the fully sustainable microfinance institutions do not receive high returns to equity considering the risks involved. The Grameen Bank, which is the flagship institution for microcredit, does not make a profit; it charges an interest rate of 15. %, whereas it should charge upward of 32% to be sustainable. Microfinance institutions are often subsidized by government agencies or NGOs. Many microcredit organizations do not aspire to financial sustainability, but even when they do, they are only successful in roughly half of the cases. The reason for their lack of financial sustainability is usually the same as it is for the Grameen Bank: the reluctance to charge higher interest rates to poor households. Subsidies from donors are used to cover the financial gap. Donors have been happy to give money to microcredit associations because of their positive effects on poverty alleviation. On the other hand, microcredit associations are often of the opinion that these subsidies should be temporary. In the long run, the question of the financial sustainability of microcredit associations remains open. Achieving financial sustainability for microcredit associations is not easy. Increasing the interest rates charged to households does not appear to solve the problem. As seen in this chapter, higher interest rates often lead to adverse selection in the pool of borrowers and have the potential to increase losses from default rather than yield increased gains. Dean Karlan and Jonathan Zinman have done some research on the credit elasticity of poor households in South Africa, using randomized controlled trials. 9 Credit elasticity measures by what percent demand for credit drops when the interest rate increases by one percentage point. Their results show that at higher interest rates, demand for credit is much lower, as are repayment rates. The Grameen Bank policies could thus be justified by high credit elasticity and the negative effects of interest rates on repayment rates. While credit elasticity is high for poor households in South Africa and other developing countries, that is not the case everywhere. Microcredit associations in Latin America are less afraid to charge higher interest rates and have proved to be financially sustainable. Are these an exception to the high credit-elasticity story, or is credit elasticity less widespread than we might think? Further research is needed to answer that question. A justification for subsidizing microfinance might be the following: if money is going to go to poverty alleviation anyway, it might be better spent 9 Dean Karlan and Jonathan Zinman, “Expanding Credit Access: Using Randomized Supply Decisions to Estimate the Impacts,” Review of Financial Studies 23, no. 1 (2010): 433-464.

The Role of Credit Markets in Development households in treated neighborhoods did not spend more on health, as is usually observed in households where women have more bargaining power. Because the survey was conducted less than 2 years after the opening of the Spandana branches, it is still too early to determine the long-term consequences of microcredit on the basis of the Hyderabad experiment, and in particular, to what extent it increased household welfare and contributed to economic development. Chapter Summary The Demand for Credit in Developing Economies Some sources of demand for credit in developing countries are farmers who need to purchase seed, fertilizer, and equipment, as their work generates revenue only after they harvest a crop. Small entrepreneurs are also in need of credit. Demands for consumer credit are less prevalent, even though households borrow in the case of income shocks or to finance expenditures for important ceremonies such as weddings. The Theory of Credit Markets in Development Informational problems associated with financial transactions are ubiquitous in credit markets and problems of moral hazard and adverse selection play a fundamental role in those markets. They play an even bigger role in developing countries because it is much more difficult to use collateral to alleviate these problems, given general weaknesses in property titling systems and legal institutions. Monitoring can be a substitute for collateral, but it increases interest charges, especially for small loans because the costs of monitoring loans are mostly fixed costs. Informational problems lead to credit constraints. Commitment problems are also a factor in developing credit markets as borrowers may decide to default on their loans. In practice, however, borrowers rarely default on loans in developing countries, in part due to reputational concerns. Credit Constraints in Developing Countries Measuring how large credit constraints are is very difficult. When constraints are present, credit supply is smaller than credit demand, and credit demand is usually unobserved. Banking reforms in India that resulted in changes to the size of businesses targeted for preferential loans provide one of the few opportunities for precisely measuring credit constraints and they resulted in clear evidence for those constraints. Microfinance Microfinance is an institutional innovation that provides credit to the poor when collateral is not available. Microfinance relies on the joint liability of local communities as a substitute for collateral. Peer monitoring becomes a viable substitute for monitoring by a bank. Microcredit also allows borrowers who are more or less risk averse to self-sort into different risk groups. This alleviates the adverse selection problem in lending. Not all microfinance institutions are financially sustainable and many require subsidies to remain solvent.

Structural Change and Development Strategies Economic development is associated with important changes in the structure of an economy. In the late 18th century and into the 19th century, the British economy industrialized as textile production moved to factories, manufacturers began to use the steam engine, and large steel mills were constructed. These new technologies devoured coal and iron ore in the production of rails, locomotives, and large industrial machines. Millions of people left the countryside to work in modern factories. Soon after England industrialized, other European countries followed. Germany, in particular, developed very impressive steel and chemical industries. At the end of the 19th century, the expanding U.S. economy, recovering from a devastating civil war, also developed a strong industrial sector. The industrial extraction of oil through the use of drilling rigs and wells in Pennsylvania led to many manufacturing applications, products, and materials, and it fueled the nascent car industry in the early 20th century. More than 100 years later, the modern Chinese economy, which had been predominantly rural, is now following a similar path, becoming one of the world’s most important manufacturing bases. Millions of China’s rural inhabitants have left their fields and small village workshops to migrate thousands of miles away to urban areas with modern factories that produce shirts, jeans, dresses, television sets, computers, radios, and microwave ovens for export. H ow did these countries manage the change from agriculture-based to manufacturing-based economies? How did they find the capital to build new mills and factories? How were they able to attract the necessary labor force from the countryside? How did this structural change facilitate the development and growth of their countries? In this chapter, we take a closer look at the processes by which countries change their production structure from primarily agricultural to industrial, how this structural change results in the migration of the work force from the countryside to the cities, and what strategies and government policies make this structural change possible. How can growth in one sector promote growth in other sectors? Should countries insist on protecting their domestic industry to create their own manufacturing base or should they instead emphasize the development of a competitive export sector? What is the role of foreign aid in development strategies? These are some of the critical questions we will address as we consider structural change and development strategies.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries appalled to learn that children work in factories for very low wages and there are campaigns to boycott products from companies using child labor. However, we should not forget that, in the 19th century and even in the early 20th century, child labor was pervasive in the United States and Europe. Even then, there were vigorous campaigns against child labor and bans on child labor were seen as necessary in order to secure universal primary education. As was the case in Europe more than 100 years ago, many developing countries have now taken steps to ban child labor; India took the bold step of banning child labor in 2006. Even when they are adopted, however, laws banning child labor are not always enforced. Is it a good thing to ban child labor? Can it hurt or help the cause of development? There is a large body of literature on child labor. One of the most recent analyses of it is by Jean-Marie Baland and James A. Robinson. 4 They present a sophisticated examination of child labor and a good reason to ban it. Moreover, they argue that banning child labor can be good for development. Let us discuss their analysis. When we think about child labor, it seems obvious that the children in question would be better off if they received an education in order to realize higher earnings later in life. If, instead, parents make their children work, the first reason for this decision that comes to mind is that they are selfish and only think about the children’s contribution to the household income. Are things really that simple? Would altruistic parents never make their children work? Parents who place their children’s welfare before their own would, in general, want to give their children an education, even if that requires great parental sacrifice. Most parents, however, are neither completely selfish nor completely altruistic: they care both about their children and about themselves. The best solution for partly altruistic parents is to pay for their children’s education, but then to reduce the children’s inheritance in order to make them share the costs of the education they have received. That way, the interests of both the parents and the children are taken into account: the children receive an education instead of working and the costs of education are shared between parents and children. This is, after all, what is done in many American families. However, in many developing countries, parents might be too poor to reduce bequests to their offspring as a way of having the children share the costs of their education. Moreover, because of credit constraints, they are not in a position to borrow to pay for their children’s education. Such loans would be ideal because they would help pass part of the costs of education to the children who would have to reimburse a portion of the loan after completing their education. Because of poverty and credit constraints, parents might not be able or willing to bear all the costs of their children’s education without anything in exchange. That is why they may prefer to send their children to work rather than to school. Thus, even partly altruistic parents might make their children work and thus forfeit a better education. Why might a ban on child labor help in such a situation? Baland and Robinson argue that a collective withdrawal of children from the labor market reduces labor supply, which has positive effects on the wages of adults, who 4 Jean-Marie Baland and James A. Robinson, “Is Child Labor Inefficient?” Journal of Political Economy 108, no. 4 (2000): 663-679.

Even when they are adopted, however, laws banning child labor are not always enforced. Is it a good thing to ban child labor? Can it hurt or help the cause of development? There is a large body of literature on child labor. One of the most recent analyses of it is by Jean-Marie Baland and James A. Robinson. 4 They present a sophisticated examination of child labor and a good reason to ban it. Moreover, they argue that banning child labor can be good for development. Let us discuss their analysis. When we think about child labor, it seems obvious that the children in question would be better off if they received an education in order to realize higher earnings later in life. If, instead, parents make their children work, the first reason for this decision that comes to mind is that they are selfish and only think about the children’s contribution to the household income. Are things really that simple? Would altruistic parents never make their children work? Parents who place their children’s welfare before their own would, in general, want to give their children an education, even if that requires great parental sacrifice. Most parents, however, are neither completely selfish nor completely altruistic: they care both about their children and about themselves. The best solution for partly altruistic parents is to pay for their children’s education, but then to reduce the children’s inheritance in order to make them share the costs of the education they have received. That way, the interests of both the parents and the children are taken into account: the children receive an education instead of working and the costs of education are shared between parents and children. This is, after all, what is done in many American families. However, in many developing countries, parents might be too poor to reduce bequests to their offspring as a way of having the children share the costs of their education. Moreover, because of credit constraints, they are not in a position to borrow to pay for their children’s education. Such loans would be ideal because they would help pass part of the costs of education to the children who would have to reimburse a portion of the loan after completing their education. Because of poverty and credit constraints, parents might not be able or willing to bear all the costs of their children’s education without anything in exchange. That is why they may prefer to send their children to work rather than to school. Thus, even partly altruistic parents might make their children work and thus forfeit a better education. Why might a ban on child labor help in such a situation? Baland and Robinson argue that a collective withdrawal of children from the labor market reduces labor supply, which has positive effects on the wages of adults, who 4 Jean-Marie Baland and James A.

Corruption provide for free. However, in the case of bribes paid by citizens to bureaucrats and policemen as a reward for them to ignore actions that break the law, there will be very little incentive on either side to report these practices to anticorruption authorities. Why Is Fighting Corruption So Difficult? One reason why fighting corruption is so difficult is related to the coordination problems. This has been studied in a model by Jens Andvig and Karl Ove Moene. 32 They found that if the probability of being detected when taking a bribe declined along with the number of corrupt officials, then there were two possible coordination equilibria: one honest and one corrupt. If all officials were honest, the incentive to stay honest would be strong because there would be a high probability of being caught when acting dishonestly. There would thus be no incentive to deviate and everybody would be honest. If, on the other hand, all officials were corrupt, there was no disincentive to be corrupt because the probability of being caught would be low due to so many others being corrupt. In a situation where corruption is widespread, it is thus very difficult to change the behavior of corrupt officials. It would take a very intense campaign to convince these bureaucrats that there is a high probability that they will be caught. However, if corruption is indeed widespread, it is very difficult to find enough honest and incorruptible officials to engage in such a campaign. Moreover, it may also be quite a challenge to find the necessary fiscal resources to fund an anticorruption campaign within a corrupt government, where funds are routinely pocketed by bureaucrats at all levels. Another argument made in a model by Jean Tirole is that a reputation for corruption persists and is difficult to repair. 33 Because reputations endure, an administration that would launch a vigorous anticorruption campaign would incur the campaign’s costs, but might not reap its benefits for a long time. Indeed, if a country keeps its reputation of corruption even while it fights to repair that reputation, foreign investors would still shy away from investing in that country. Even domestic investors might not give credit to the government’s efforts and, as a result, would fail to invest or enter the economy’s formal sector. It would only be after observing a long period of honest behavior by the government and its officials that economic agents would start to change their expectations. Precisely because the private sector and foreign investors might fail to react positively to an anticorruption campaign, an anticorruption government might be seen to have excessively high costs and low immediate benefits. The persistence of the reputation for corruption might thus create a “corruption trap”: once a country falls in, it is difficult to get out. A country that has been corrupt is thus likely to stay corrupt because of the effects of the negative reputation, while a country that has been honest, but briefly lapses into corruption, might get stuck in its trap. 32 Jens C. Andvig and Karl Ove Moene, “How Corruption May Corrupt,” Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 13, no. 1 (1990): 63-76. 33 Jean Tirole, “A Theory of Collective Reputations (with Applications to the Persistence of Corruption and to Firm Quality),” The Review of Economic Studies 63, no. 1 (1996): 1-22.

Econometric Appendix in applied econometrics. We introduce the reader to panel regression analysis, which allows the joint analysis of data variation across time and across individuals or across space. In many cases, fixed-effect and differencein- differences analysis yield rigorous estimations of causal effects when randomization is absent. Finally, we introduce the topic of instrumental variables, which also allows us to analyze data as if they had been generated by a randomized experiment. These techniques are used and must be understood in order to follow modern research in development eonomics. Some Basic Statistical Concepts Econometrics uses statistical techniques to study how economic variables affect each other. For example, we may be interested in knowing how economic growth affects conflict or how education affects wages, but before trying to understand how economic variables relate to one another, we must first understand some basic properties of a single variable. Therefore, we must first understand some basic definitions such as the mean, the variance, and the standard deviation. We explain them in terms of a statistical distribution and then explain how they are measured using statistical samples. We then explain relations between two or more variables, such as covariance and correlation. We explain how they are measured and how regression analysis can measure their relation. Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Let us start by thinking of a statistical distribution. Call X an economic variable, such as, for example, the height of men around the world. If we think of the height of men as a statistical distribution, this means that there will be certain properties to this distribution. These properties will answer basic questions we might have such as what the average height is, how much dispersion and variation there is in height, and so forth. Ideally, we can discover the properties of this distribution by measuring all men on earth. In reality, such an exercise would be too impractical and costly, so we take samples. We must therefore distinguish between the true distribution (the actual statistical distribution based on all men on earth) which we will call X, and a sample (a set of observations drawn from a limited number of men) of n observations, say x 1 , x 2 , c , x n ,. We will make inferences about the true distribution using sampled data. In order to do this, it is important to distinguish between the true distribution and sample data. Because X has statistical properties, we also call it a random or stochastic variable , a variable that takes on random values drawn from its statistical distribution. The toss of a coin is a random variable that takes only two values, heads or tails, with 50% probablility for each. When sampling a person’s height, we are similarly drawing at random from the distribution of heights. E ( X ) = m x is the expected height or mean height, i.e., average height, in the true distribution of all possible heights. E(X ) is sometimes also called the

The Role of Credit Markets in Development Operational sustainability is the ability of a financial institution to generate enough revenue to cover operating costs. As Table 3 shows, operational sustainability is generally achieved by microfinance programs except for village banks and those banks targeting the poorest borrowers. Financial sustainability , on the other hand, requires banks to be able to cover the cost of capital as well. Imagine that a bank has revenues of 105 and costs of 100, which would make it operationally sustainable. Imagine, however, that investing 100 would, on average, return 110 to the bank. Alternatively, assume that the costs of 100 would have to be borrowed at an interest rate of 10%. In that case, if we want to include the cost of capital, we must add 10 to the costs of 100.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries they will send boys first. Programs that reduce the costs of schooling thus often lead to more positive enrollment effects for girls than for boys. Because reducing the educational gender gap is an important objective and because many education programs seem to work more effectively for girls, various programs target girls specifically as a way to reduce the educational gender gap in the most effective way. Indian NGO Seva Mandir initiated a program in Indian schools to hire a second teacher for each class so as to increase school attendance and the quality of teaching. The second teacher had to be a woman. The idea was that this would improve the quality of education, especially for girls. The program was indeed effective; it had some positive effects on the number of days a school was closed due to endemic teacher absenteeism. Schools with one teacher were closed 44% of the time, whereas schools with the two-teachers program were closed 39% of the time. While the difference is not huge, a more impressive result of the program is that girls’ attendance increased by 50%. No significant effect was recorded on the attendance of boys. In 2001, Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton conducted a randomized evaluation of the Girl’s Scholarship Program (GSP) in rural Kenya that was designed to enhance girls’ education. 19 Out of a set of 128 schools, half were randomly selected. The program provided merit-based scholarship to girls who scored in the top 15% on government-administered tests. These scholarships provided uniforms, partial school fees, and school supplies. The results were quite positive; there was higher school attendance in the schools where the program was implemented and significantly higher test scores were recorded. Interestingly, this program also generated positive externalities in the schools where it was implemented. First of all, a higher teacher attendance was observed, even though the teachers did not benefit directly from the program. Second, better school results were observed for boys, even though boys did not benefit from the program either. Third, girls who were not in the top 15% also performed better. This suggests that programs targeting only certain categories of pupils (in this case, the best female pupils) also benefited others in the class due to the overall stimulation provided. This is a clear example of externalities generated by education, as discussed earlier in this chapter. 19 Michael Kremer, Edward Miguel, and Rebecca Thornton, “Incentives to Learn,” 2009, op. cit. . Chapter Summary Measuring the Education Gap In developing countries, the average number of years of schooling is 7.09, whereas in advanced economies it is 11.03. Primary school enrollment in developing countries is still somewhat lower than in developed countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, but the situation has improved drastically in recent decades. Primary school enrollment is now found all over the world. Literacy rates in low-income countries have gone up, but a gap remains. The gap in secondary-school enrollment remains more important. There is also a substantial gender gap in education. Primary- and especially secondary-school enrollment tends to be lower for girls than for boys. There is also a quality gap in education. International test scores for 15-year-olds in secondary school show a substantial gap in the quality of secondary education between developing and developed countries. Class sizes are larger in developing countries, teachers are not as well

Schools with one teacher were closed 44% of the time, whereas schools with the two-teachers program were closed 39% of the time. While the difference is not huge, a more impressive result of the program is that girls’ attendance increased by 50%. No significant effect was recorded on the attendance of boys. In 2001, Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton conducted a randomized evaluation of the Girl’s Scholarship Program (GSP) in rural Kenya that was designed to enhance girls’ education. 19 Out of a set of 128 schools, half were randomly selected. The program provided merit-based scholarship to girls who scored in the top 15% on government-administered tests. These scholarships provided uniforms, partial school fees, and school supplies. The results were quite positive; there was higher school attendance in the schools where the program was implemented and significantly higher test scores were recorded. Interestingly, this program also generated positive externalities in the schools where it was implemented. First of all, a higher teacher attendance was observed, even though the teachers did not benefit directly from the program. Second, better school results were observed for boys, even though boys did not benefit from the program either. Third, girls who were not in the top 15% also performed better. This suggests that programs targeting only certain categories of pupils (in this case, the best female pupils) also benefited others in the class due to the overall stimulation provided. This is a clear example of externalities generated by education, as discussed earlier in this chapter. 19 Michael Kremer, Edward Miguel, and Rebecca Thornton, “Incentives to Learn,” 2009, op. cit. . Chapter Summary Measuring the Education Gap In developing countries, the average number of years of schooling is 7.09, whereas in advanced economies it is 11.03. Primary school enrollment in developing countries is still somewhat lower than in developed countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, but the situation has improved drastically in recent decades. Primary school enrollment is now found all over the world. Literacy rates in low-income countries have gone up, but a gap remains. The gap in secondary-school enrollment remains more important. There is also a substantial gender gap in education. Primary- and especially secondary-school enrollment tends to be lower for girls than for boys. There is also a quality gap in education. International test scores for 15-year-olds in secondary school show a substantial gap in the quality of secondary education between developing and developed countries. Class sizes are larger in developing countries, teachers are not as well 


Delivering Education in Developing Countries trained, teacher absenteeism is significant, and there is scarcity of teaching material, blackboards, classrooms, etc. The Returns to Education in Developing Countries The returns to education measure the net benefit of investment in education or human capital. These returns accrue not only to those who invest in education, but also to others because of externalities to education. The knowledge transmitted tends to spread and benefits others in local communities, businesses, and neighborhoods. Externalities from education and credit constraints for poor households justify the role of government in education. Empirical research suggests that the returns per year of education are slightly above 20%. Institutions and Education in Developing Countries Child labor is a big issue in developing countries. Sending children to school improves families and society more than if children are forced to earn a living to supplement household income. The increases in family income from education compensate for the loss of income due to years of education and its costs. Moreover, withdrawing children from the labor market helps to sustain higher wages for adults in the economy. Nevertheless, child labor is still widespread because parents cannot borrow to pay for their children’s education. What Reforms Can Improve Education? We have discussed at length the evidence on what works to improve education in developing countries. In India, the experimental introduction of cameras with a tamper-proof date and time stamp to take pictures of teachers and pupils at the beginning and end of each school day proved very effective in reducing teacher absenteeism. Experimental programs of incentives to provide higher pay to teachers with better attendance did not work as well, especially if these programs were administered by the headmasters. Experimental programs to involve parents more in monitoring school activities delivered mixed results, with few significant effects on student performance. Evidence on voucher programs that allow children to attend private schools in the urban areas of developed countries is also mixed. A lottery voucher program in Colombia had positive results on student performance, but the much larger voucher program introduced in Chile merely led to higher sorting of students, with the better students going to private schools and the poorer students staying behind in public schools without any observable improvement in overall school performance. Various programs to reduce the costs of schooling have had a positive effect on school enrollment. These include conditional transfers giving parents cash grants that are contingent on the parents sending their children to school, free uniforms, or school meals such as free breakfasts. Various programs that provide textbooks and school supplies have proved to be somewhat disappointing. Programs designed to address the gender educational gap in developing countries have been quite successful. In an experimental remedial education program introduced in India, a second teacher was hired in certain schools in order to increase school attendance and the quality of teaching. The second teacher had to be a woman. The program had a very positive effect on the attendance of girls and led to less disruption of classes due to teacher absenteeism. Merit-based scholarships for girls introduced in Kenya proved to be very cost effective in increasing school performance for girls as well as for boys. Many rigorously designed experiments are taking place in developing countries to find out what are the most cost-effective ways of improving the provision of education. The results of those studies will have significant effects on policy choices in developing countries in years to come.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries send their children to school. The program targeted poor families below a certain income level in rural locations and it also provided health benefits. The education component gave families the equivalent of $28 per month for each child in grades 3 through 9 if the child attended more than 85% of classes. It started in 1997 and was phased in randomly in rural communities. By 1999, it covered 40% of rural families in Mexico. This randomized phase-in made an accurate evaluation of the program’s effects possible. Significant research has been done using data from the Progresa program. T. Paul Schultz, who evaluated the impact of the Progresa program, found that it resulted in an average 3. % increase in enrollment for all students in grades 1 through 8. 16 The increase was largest among girls who had completed grade 6, with as much as 15. % higher enrollment. The Progresa program was later introduced throughout the country on the basis of this success and is considered a model transfer program for development countries. School meals. Vermeersch and Kremer evaluated an experiment in 25 Kenyan preschools where a free breakfast was introduced for children. 17 The results were compared to 25 similar schools without a breakfast program. They found that school attendance in the schools where the program was implemented was 30% greater. The provision of free breakfasts, however, cut into school time. Overall, test scores were 0.4 standard deviations greater in the program schools compared to schools without the breakfast program, but only if the teacher had been well-trained prior to the program’s implementation. Uniforms, textbooks, and classroom improvements. The NGO, International Child Support, also provided uniforms, textbooks, and classroom improvements to 14 Kenyan schools. The experiment was evaluated by Michael Kremer, Edward Miguel, and Rebecca Thornton. 18 Uniforms costs $ , but the per capita annual income in Kenya is around $340. A uniform thus represents 1. % of annual income. Taking into account that per capita income in the United States is around $35,000, the cost of the same uniform would be the equivalent of roughly $600 for a U.S. student. In schools where the ICS program was implemented, dropout rates were much lower and students completed 15% more years of schooling. However, the researchers found that students from nearby schools transferred into the program schools, so that eventually, no measurable overall impact on test scores was observed. Reducing the Educational Gender Gap We saw that school enrollment of girls is lower in developing countries. Girls’ school participation appears more responsive to different programs that cut education costs. If families cannot afford to send all their children to school, 16 T.

Econometric Appendix treatment. In other words, the treatment effect will, in this case, be smaller than what the observations tell us. As a result, we must be careful in measuring treatment effects to avoid including selection bias. Randomized Evaluations How, then, can we accurately measure a treatment effect so as to avoid a possible selection bias? The answer is randomized assignment of treatments. The generalization of randomized evaluations in developing countries has been one of the most exciting new directions in development economics research. Randomized evaluations have been done in medicine for quite a while and they are now increasingly used in economics. The idea is to randomize the treatment so that the potential health outcome of someone treated would be the same as that of someone not treated: E ( Y 0 i H D i = 1) = E ( Y 0 i H D i = 0). Randomized evaluation thus solves the selection bias and gives unbiased estimates of the treatment effect. For more on how to do randomized evaluations, see Esther Duflo et al. , or Joshua Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2 Ordinary Least Squares and Causal Inference Ordinary least squares, the regression technique analyzed above, is the appropriate regression method when performing a randomized evaluation. Look at the following regression model: Y = a + r D + h , where Y is the outcome variable and D is a treatment variable taking the value of 0 or 1. In the regression equation, r is the treatment effect. Think of the malaria example above. The error term is h . Using this equation, we have that E ( Y H D = 1) = a + r + E ( h H D = 1). Similarly, we have that E ( Y H D = 0) = a + E ( h H D = 0). Therefore, taking the difference between the two equations, we get: E ( Y H D = 1) E ( Y H D = 0) = r + E ( h H D = 1) E ( h H D = 0). As we can see, this expression is the same as the one above summing the treatment effect and the selection bias. The difference between the expected health for those treated and the expected health for those not treated is equal to the treatment effect plus the selection effect. 2 Esther Duflo, Rachel Glennerster, and Michael Kremer, (2007) “Using Randomization in Development Research: A Toolkit” (discussion paper 6059, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 2007); and Joshua D.

Econometric Appendix Dividing by n, distributing, and rearranging we get: b = s xy s 2 x In other words, the regression coefficient b is estimated as the covariance between the two variables divided by the variance of the regressor. We interpret coefficient b as the share of the variance of X that can be explained by the covariance between X and Y. This is an intuitive explanation that helps us understand regression results. From the way it is derived, the regression coefficient is estimated to minimize the estimation error of the relation between variables Y and X. In regressions with multiple dependent variables, we can estimate regression coefficients using the same method. Their formula is more complex, but their interpretation remains roughly the same. When reading a regression table, the standard error for the coefficient is usually in parentheses below the coefficient. It indicates the possible variation of the coefficient. Some coefficients are estimated with precision and have a very small standard error while other coefficients are estimated with less precision. It often happens that coefficients are estimated with so little precision that we cannot be sure they are significantly different from zero. Typically, when dividing the coefficient by the standard error, the rule of thumb is that if we obtain a number greater than 2, then it is significantly different from zero. Regression tables often give a percent level of significance, 10%, 5%, 1%, etc. If a coefficient is significant at the 5% level, this means that we can be 95% confident that the coefficient is different from zero. Regressions sometimes give t-statistics instead of standard errors. T-statistics are computed by dividing the coefficient by its standard error. We lack the space to say much more about the ordinary least square model. However, it is important to emphasize the basic assumptions underlying the OLS model. Take again our basic model: Y = a + b X + e Not only do we require that E ( e ) = 0 as stated above, but we also require that E ( e H X ) = 0. In other words, X and e are assumed to be uncorrelated. This is very important as we will see below. The other assumption is that samples from the distribution of X and Y must be drawn independently and randomly. Causal Inference When performing regression analysis between variables, it is tempting to make causal inferences of the type “ Y is caused by X. ” In these situations, we must be very careful. Running a regression does not mean that we have found a causal relationship. Causality can go in many different directions. Suppose we find a correlation between war and GDP. Is a low GDP causing war or is war damaging the economy? Moreover, regressions can sometimes be spurious. Suppose

Econometric Appendix that we observe a positive correlation between drownings in swimming pools and ice cream sales. Can we claim that ice cream sales cause drownings? No, of course not. In this case, both ice cream sales and drownings are caused by another underlying variable, heat waves. The Treatment Effect and Selection Bias Suppose we want to understand the effect of a malaria vaccine on health. Let us note the treatment variable by D i = { , 1}, where a value of 1 is given to individuals who received the vaccine and a value of 0 to those who did not. Let us now use Y 1 i as the health outcome variable for individual i who got the treatment. Let us call Y 0 i the health outcome variable for the same individual i if that person was not included in the treatment group. These variables are called “potential outcome” variables. What does this mean? An individual can have two potential outcomes depending on whether that person receives the treatment or not. In reality, we do not observe two health outcomes for the same individual. Some are treated and some are not. However, the causal effect we are really interested in is Y 1 i Y 0 i . This represents the difference between treatment and nontreatment for individual i . If an individual is treated, we want to know the difference in his or her health outcome relative to a situation in which that same individual would not be treated. Similarly, if an individual is not treated, we would want to know the difference in health outcome in a counterfactual situation in which that individual would be treated. The problem is that we have only one observation for each individual, the health outcome. We observe the health outcome of those treated and the health outcome of those not treated. Based on observations on health outcomes and the identity of who was treated and who was not, we can find E ( Y i H D i = 1) E ( Y i H D i = 0). This is the observed difference in health outcome for those treated compared to those not treated. This is also by definition equal to E ( Y 1 i H D i = 1) E ( Y 0 i H D i = 0). Adding and subtracting E ( Y 0 i H D i = 1), we get E ( Y i H D i = 1) E ( Y i H D i = 0) = [ E ( Y 1 i H D i = 1) E ( Y 0 i H D i = 1)] + [ E ( Y 0 i H D i = 1) E ( Y 0 i H D i = 0)]. The first term [ E ( Y 1 i H D i = 1) E ( Y 0 i H D i = 1)] represents the treatment effect or the effect of the treatment on the individuals who were treated. This is the causal effect we are interested in. The second term [ E ( Y 0 i H D i = 1) E ( Y 0 i H D i = 0)] is the selection bias . It represents the difference in expected health between those who were treated and those who were not. Suppose that those who received the malaria vaccine are more health-conscious than those who did not. We can thus expect those people to be healthier in general because they are more concerned with their health. Because the difference in health between those treated and those who were not treated is what we observe, if there is a selection bias, this observed difference will exaggerate the treatment effect. The malaria vaccine will no doubt make a difference and improve people’s health. However, those who chose to take the malaria vaccine might generally be in better health. Therefore, the presence of a selection bias will exaggerate the real effect of the

Econometric Appendix When drawing observations x 1 , x 2 , c x n and y 1 , y 2 , c y n from both distributions, the sample covariance is computed in the following way: s xy = 1 n a n i = 1 ( x i x )( y i y ) = 1 n a n i = 1 ( x i y i x i y y i x + x y ) = 1 n a n i = 1 x i y i x y We can also calculate what is called a correlation coefficient , a statistic that measures the degree to which two variables move together. It is calculated by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of both variables. r xy = s xy s x s y We can show that a correlation coefficient is always included in the interval [ 1, 1]. Note that two variables that are statistically independent will not be correlated. Bivariate Regression Analysis Now that we have seen that we can correlate variables, we can introduce regression analysis between two variables, called bivariate regression analysis . Suppose that two random variables are related in the following way: Y = a + b X + e where e is an error term, a random variable such that E ( e ) = 0. One usually calls Y the dependent variable and X the independent variable. To better understand the role that e plays, let us consider the relationship between schooling and earnings. It is reasonable to assume that more years of schooling would positively affect an individual’s wage and so we would expect the dependent variable to be earnings while the independent variable would be schooling. In a model without the error term, e , we would have the relationship, “ earnings = a + b schooling .” This model suggests that education alone determines a person’s level of earnings. Unfortunately, data and common sense would suggest otherwise because many other factors determine earnings such as geography, gender, race, and even luck. If we include the error term, e , in our model, then it would allow for other factors, such as the ones stated above, to determine wage. We can easily see when using the expectations operator that E ( Y ) = b E ( X ). If we know b , then we can make predictions on E(Y ) based on E ( X ) . The big question is then: how do we know b ? How can we estimate b using sample distributions x 1 , x 2 , c x n and y 1 , y 2 , c y n ? Call b our estimate of b . Call e i = y i a bx i the residual of a regression with estimates of parameters a and b. We can call e i the estimation error. We would like to choose an estimate of b that corresponds to a regression line that fits the data well, in other words, that minimizes the estimation errors. Figure 1 depicts e i = y i a bx i graphically.

Delivering Education in Developing Countries we can see that the gap in the share of an English-language education between the higher castes and the middle or lower castes remains roughly the same. For girls, the finding is very different: the gap in the share of an English-language education between the high-caste girls and those from the middle and especially the lower castes narrows over time and nearly disappears. Why were girls from the lower and middle castes better able than boys to seize the opportunity to receive an English-language education in the 1990s? Munshi and Rosenzweig explain this by network externalities among caste members. Social connections have always been important to secure jobs within a jati and investing in the jati network was thus very important. Boys in lower castes took less advantage of the opportunity provided by an English-language education because the local language, Marathi, has traditionally been more valuable than English in securing the social connections needed to get jobs. The network structure of caste can thus restrict job mobility. Girls, on the other hand, did not get traditional jobs within a jati and, by investing more in an Englishlanguage education, they were thus able to seize opportunities in the new economy and the service sector much faster than boys from the same castes. These new occupations do not rely on caste networks. It will be interesting to see if, FIGURE 4b The Proportion of Girls Schooled in English among Different Castes 0 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 2 4 6 Proportion schooled in English 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 High Medium Low Year Over time (year 1 is 1982 and year 20 is 2001), the proportion of lower-caste girls learning English increased much faster than that for lower-caste boys.

Economic Growth The third column does the same as the first two columns except that now the “neoEuropes”—United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—are excluded from the regression. The results are unchanged, showing that they are not driven by those countries. The fourth column performs the same analysis excluding Africa, to see if the results are entirely driven by that continent. The coefficients remain significant, though the coefficient of the effect of institutions on log GDP per capita is now somewhat lower. The fifth column introduces dummy variables for continents and the results are still unaffected. Chapter Summary Growth and Factors of Production The production function relates output to factors of production labor and capital: Y t = F ( K t , L t ). It allows us to derive different measures of productivity: average productivity of capital ( Y t / K t ) and labor ( Y t / L t ), marginal productivity of capital ( 0 Y t / 0 k t ) and labor ( 0 Y t / 0 L t ) as well as total factor productivity, the part of output that is not explained by capital and labor. We have learned how to do growth accounting and we can decompose growth into the contribution of factor accumulation and total factor productivity: growth of output g Y is the sum of total factor productivity growth a and a combination of the growth of capital g K and the growth of labor g L . The Neoclassical Solow Growth Model The Solow model assumes a diminishing marginal return to capital. We derive a steady state capital intensity k * ( = K * / L * ) and a steady state level of output per capita that depends on the savings rate s, population growth n, the depreciation rate d , total factor productivity A and the share of capital in total income a . The Solow model predicts that poorer countries should grow faster than rich countries. Endogenous Growth Theory Endogenous growth theory derives economic growth as based on endogenous technical change determined by the innovation incentives of entrepreneurs. Innovation gives partial monopoly rights to entrepreneurs. Endogenous growth predicts that rich countries should grow faster than poor countries because their knowledge base is larger. Poor countries can only catch up if they benefit from technological transfers. Empirical Analysis of Economic Growth Empirical analysis of growth shows that capital accumulation and human capital accumulation do not adequately explain the large differences in income levels between the richest and the poorest countries in the world. The role of geography as an explanation for large differences in income across the world is based on two arguments: 1) economic activity is more difficult in tropical areas because of the heat and tropical diseases, and 2) landlocked areas are more isolated and have less access to trade opportunities. A problem with the geography explanation for growth is that there is a negative correlation between economic development in 1500 and today. If geography were the main explanation for differences in development, this correlation should be positive. Research has found a convincing causal effect from institutions to growth. Countries with institutions that are more protective of property rights have become richer and countries with inadequate protection of property rights have remained poor. Using settler mortality as an instrumental variable for institutions, we find that this is a causal effect, not a mere correlation.

Corruption and predatory, while the regime of the next dictator, Chung-Hee Park (1961- 1979), is often seen as much less corrupt. 27 However, controversy has arisen in the light of the East Asian financial crisis and some scholars have argued that corruption was still quite prevalent under Park. 28 In any case, progress in the fight against corruption in South Korea was not as spectacular as in Hong Kong or Singapore. Higher Pay for Civil Servants: Does It Work? Researchers have tried to determine whether higher pay for civil servants was, in general, a good strategy for fighting corruption. The idea is appealing: if civil servants are paid well, they will be more fearful of losing their jobs if they are caught taking bribes and will therefore have more incentives to fulfill their responsibilities honestly. On the other hand, poorly paid civil servants will have no shame and no fear of taking bribes. This is a version of the efficiency wage theory of incentives, according to which paying workers higher wages gives them a greater incentive to work hard. 29 However, international studies did not find significant evidence of such an effect. James Rauch and Peter Evans as well as Treisman found no effect, whereas Caroline Van Rijckeghem and Beatrice Weder did. 30 Di Tella and Schargrodsky, in their study of hospitals in Buenos Aires, found that higher wages had a deterrent effect, but only if there was sufficient monitoring. 31 Thus, it seems that higher wages alone are not effective to fight corruption and should be combined with more monitoring. The alternative to fighting corruption from above is to combat it from below. Citizen access to information; a strong, free media; transparency of public decisions; and public participation in the decision-making process are tools to ensure citizen enforcement and monitoring. However, these measures are thoroughly institutionalized, they should not be seen as a panacea because grassroots initiatives are usually subject to the collective-action problems. Moreover, citizens may frequently have reasons not to denounce a case of corruption. They will have an incentive to denounce bureaucrats who expect bribes for a service that they should, in principle, 27 Peter B.

Structural Change and Development Strategies When they channeled their investment profits back to the domestic economy, it was, for the most part, only to finance the consumption habits of the rich. Inefficient industrial sectors. Contrary to the Lewis model, the modern industrial sectors in developing economies have often been unable to make large profits due to inefficient management. They were, therefore, unable to perform their expected roles in developing the economy. In some cases, investment came from government. This was the case of India’s state-owned enterprises, while in Latin American nations, government subsidies helped to create domestic industries. Unfortunately, the governments in these countries operated these industries inefficiently. In many cases, unions organized workers to obtain higher wages. 6 Remember that the Lewis model assumes competitive labor markets in which excess labor bids down wages. Because the marginal product of labor is high in the modern sector, strong trade unions could organize workers and threaten to strike unless they earned wages closer to, or even higher than, the value of the marginal product of labor in industry. If trade unions were able to impose high wages on the industrial sector, the return on capital accumulation would be lower and there would be less capital accumulation and growth. Urban migration in practice. The effect of migration on development has been unequal at best. In countries such as China, the mobilization of the surplus labor in agriculture has contributed to a booming manufacturing sector. In most other developing countries, however, enormous rural-urban migration has led to the development of shantytowns, such as the Brazilian favelas, and an increase in the size of the informal sector , the economic sector that operates outside the formal legal system. Members of the informal sector do not have business licenses, do not declare their income, and do not pay taxes on their informal income. The informal sector includes those who work as street peddlers, as well as the employees of the sweatshops and workshops that manufacture goods for global export. Even though many of the people who migrate from the agricultural sector to the manufacturing sector ultimately work in the informal sector, the informal sector is not particularly productive. The move from the agricultural to the informal sector represents a shift from rural poverty to urban poverty. Moreover, not all who migrate from agriculture find urban employment, even in the informal sector; there is high unemployment in the big cities of the developing world. Contrary to the predictions of the Lewis model, the population shift from rural to urban areas has had little overall effect on development and growth. Figure 4 plots the change in the urbanization rate for a set of 153 countries between 1980 and 2010 on the horizontal axis, and the average annual growth of GDP per capita for the same period on the vertical axis. We can see that there have been large, rapid increases in urbanization rates during that period, but countries that have higher changes in urbanization rates do not necessarily have higher average growth rates. 6 This was especially the case in Latin America, at least until the 1970s. See, for example, Charles S. Maier, In Search of Stability: Explorations in Historical Political Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987).

We can see that there have been large, rapid increases in urbanization rates during that period, but countries that have higher changes in urbanization rates do not necessarily have higher average growth rates. 6 This was especially the case in Latin America, at least until the 1970s. See, for example, Charles S. Maier, In Search of Stability: Explorations in Historical Political Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987). 


Econometric Appendix Note that in the term for the regression constant, we have both individualspecific constants and time-specific constants. This will prove very useful for causal inference. Let us now explain what we can do with panel data. Fixed Effects and Difference-in-Differences Estimation Suppose we want to perform a regression analysis using panel data. Suppose that the treatment was not based on randomization. We might thus have selection effects. Moreover, we might also have omitted variables that affect an individual’s health but that we have not measured. Indeed, suppose that the true model takes this form: Y it = a i + a t = + r D it + b X it + g 0 Y 0 it + g 1 Y 1 it + c + g n Y nit + h it where Y 0 it , Y 1 it , c , Y nit are omitted variables. One way of dealing with the problem of omitted variables in panel regression is to estimate what are called fixed effects , i.e., a constant coefficient specific to each individual i. Because we have variation across individuals and across time, the constants we estimate for each individual, a i in the panel regression above are called individual fixed effects. These fixed effects can capture omitted variables because they capture the variation across individuals. For example, consider running a regression in which the dependent variable is test scores and the independent variable is the amount of time that a student spends studying. Such a regression would suffer from omitted variable bias because the time that a student spends studying is not the only determinant of her score. We might plausibly believe that some students have a natural affinity for a particular subject and it causes them to have higher scores than their classmates for the same amount of studying. This innate ability would not be captured if we simply ran a regression of test scores on time spent studying. If we are willing to believe that each student has his or her own affinity for a subject and that this ability does not change over time, then we can include individual fixed effects to account for the ability variable that we fail to observe. The fixed effect, or constant estimated for each individual, is thus supposed to absorb the effect of all omitted variables that do not vary over time. This is reassuring and panel regressions are very useful when we work with data that are not based on randomized treatment and do not satisfy the conditions for ordinary least squares. The important restriction is that fixed effects will capture this unobserved heterogeneity only to the extent that the sum of these omitted variables does not vary across time. In other words, this will be the case if Y 0 it , Y 1 it , c , Y nit , (or at least their sum) are time invariant, that is, if Y 0 it = Y 0 i , Y 1 it = Y 1 i . Unobserved heterogeneity that would vary across time would not be picked up by the individual fixed effect. In the case of unobserved heterogeneity, we thus have to make a good case that the omitted variables do not vary across time. Suppose that we estimate the effect of a malaria treatment on the population and that the treatment was not done in a randomized way. Suppose that the individuals vary in their health due to where they live, genetic factors, etc. It seems reasonable to argue that all these unobserved variables are constant and will be captured in the fixed-effect coefficient. Assume however, that there have been improvements in hygiene over time after the

Structural Change and Development Strategies Once capital accumulation in the modern sector continues beyond K 2 to, say, level K 3 , total labor employed in agriculture falls below level L A * . With agricultural labor at levels to the right of L A * , agricultural output will then begin to fall and the marginal product of labor in agriculture will become positive. As labor continues leaving the traditional sector, the marginal product in agriculture will increase and workers in the agricultural sector can now find jobs that pay more than the subsistence level w * . The labor supply curve in the industrial sector therefore begins to slope upward. In order to attract labor away from the agricultural sector, enterprises in the industrial sector will thus be required to pay a higher wage than w * . Subsequently, the new labor market equilibrium in the industrial sector will also be higher than w * , as we can see in Figure 3. The main idea of the Lewis model is that as long as the marginal product of labor in agriculture is equal to or close to zero, it is possible to attract workers to the modern sectors at a low wage level. This makes it possible for capital in the modern sector to accumulate rapidly. Structural change occurs as the agricultural sector shrinks while the industrial sector expands. Labor shifts to the more productive modern sector and as a consequence of this structural change, the economy grows. The Lewis Model in Practice The Lewis model has played a very important role in development economics. In the 1960s and 1970s, one of the primary concepts in development was that massive aid was needed to finance the development of the modern sector. This vision was very optimistic. In countries where development has been successful, such as China in recent decades, the Lewis model is a good approximation of reality. However, in most countries that have remained poor, this structural change has not taken place. When we hold the Lewis model up to economic realities, we can better understand the limitations of its assumptions. Scarcity of capital. Today, the mainstream opinion in economics is that the modern sector does not draw labor from the traditional sector very easily because of the initial scarcity of capital in developing countries. If there were enough capital, the modern sector could hire massive numbers of workers. Unfortunately, the level of capital necessary to even jumpstart the process is not readily available in many developing countries. It is because of this scarcity that international aid in the 1960s and 1970s aimed at providing that capital to developing countries in order to jumpstart their modern sectors, but the results were very mixed. Indeed, scarcity of capital is not the only reason the predictions of the Lewis model may fail to materialize. Reinvestment of profits in the domestic economy? Even if there had been adequate initial capital to jumpstart the modern sector in developing economies, it is not clear that the profits would have been reinvested domestically. In many cases, firms in very profitable sectors simply did not reinvest income into the domestic economy. For example, when oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states earned windfall revenues as a consequence of the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, they invested their profits in the global economy.

Structural Change and Development Strategies The Role of Institutions For years, the outcomes that contradicted the predictions of the Lewis model surprised economists. Development economists now see that many of these outcomes relate to the roles institutions play in the transition from agricultural to urban sectors. The return to capital is depressed when property rights are not sufficiently protected and when there are weak institutions. In those circumstances, wealthy citizens in developing countries find it more profitable to engage in capital flight , investing their capital in worldwide markets instead of in the domestic economy. High barriers to entry and inefficient institutions result in a large informal sector in which the necessity of hiding a firm’s enterprises and profits makes it difficult to introduce modern and efficient technologies. Many governments in developing countries erroneously expected that the state would spearhead urban industrial development and invest heavily in state industries. These sectors became opportunities for politicians to engage in patronage , the creation of inefficient jobs as a way to buy votes. Politicians also distributed all sorts of privileges, perks and funds to trade union leaders and bureaucrats.

Economic Growth Assume for simplicity that everyone works and that the population grows at rate n, meaning today’s population is equal to yesterday’s population plus the addition population, nL t : L t + 1 = L t (1 + n ) (19) Now divide the capital stock equation (18) by L t : K t + 1 / L t = (1 d ) K t / L t + sY t / L t (20) Taking into account the fact that y t = y t / L t and k t = K t / L t , and using the population growth equations (11) and (19), we have: (1 + n ) k t + 1 = (1 d ) k t + sA k t a (21) This equation describes how capital intensity evolves over time. With k t + 1 on the left-hand side of the equation and k t on the right-hand side of the equation, the capital intensity at t + 1 is a function of capital intensity at t. Capital intensity evolves just like capital in the capital stock equation (18), except that we must add nk t + 1 to k t + 1 to correct for the fact that the population is growing at rate n. Seen differently, if we put nk t + 1 on the right-hand side of equation (21), we have capital intensity at t + 1 that is equal to capital intensity net of depreciation at t plus savings per capita minus the negative impact of the population growth rate on capital intensity at t + 1. The Steady State in the Solow Growth Model What is the dynamic of capital intensity and income per capita over time? Figure 2 includes two functions representing both the left- and right-hand sides of the capital intensity equation (21) as two functions of k t . The left-hand side (1 + n ) k t + 1 is a straight line with slope (1 + n ) and the right-hand side (1 d ) k t + sy t is the sum of a linear function of (1 d ) k t and of a concave function sy t , = sA k t a . As we can see from Figure 2, both functions intersect at a point where k t + 1 = k t = k * , i.e., capital intensity, and thus output per capita, remain the same over time. This intersection point is called the steady state . In the steady state, the population grows at rate n, the savings rate is s, and the depreciation rate is d , but capital accumulation is such that the level of capital intensity remains the same period after period. We solve algebraically for the steady state equation by replacing in equation (21) k t + 1 and k t by k * (and y t by y * ). We get (1 + n ) k * = (1 d ) k * + sAk * a : k * = a sA n + d b 1 1 a S y * = 1 A 1 a a s n + d b a 1 a (22) Note from steady state equation (22) that the steady state capital intensity increases with the savings rate s and total factor productivity A, and decreases with the growth rate of the population n and the depreciation rate of capital d . Higher population growth reduces capital intensity by definition. Moreover, a higher depreciation rate also leads to lower capital intensity as more capital is depreciated.

Structural Change and Development Strategies Japan’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the famous MITI, played an important role in supporting export firms. MITI was in charge of Japan’s industrial policy and provided guidance to large firms that wanted to compete in the international market. Industry leaders and top MITI officials In the decades that followed its independence in 1942, India based much of its development strategy on import substitution. In an effort to implement that strategy, the Indian government instituted a variety of economic measures: •± the creation of tariffs to discourage imports; •± the implementation of 5-year plans with goals for the development of various sectors such as steel and automobiles; •± the creation of a system of industrial licensing that established government control over the development of industry; •± government review of large private-sector investment decisions to ensure that private ﬁrms would be able to fulﬁll the goals of their licensing plans; •± the establishment of government-owned ﬁrms in key sectors such as steel, ship- building, coal, aircraft production, and telecommunications; and •± the development of an extensive system of price controls in industry to ensure low prices for inputs in sectors deemed a priority in the industrialization process. Overall, economists deemed the Indian experience a failure. The industries developed under the auspices of import substitution remained protected and were not able to export successfully on world markets. Technological innovation in these sectors was very slow. The automobile sector remained stagnant, producing the same models for decades while consumers had to wait years before actually receiving the car they had purchased. The government-protected domestic industries suffered frequent losses and became accustomed to government bailouts. The Indian government eventually realized the failure of the import substitution strategy. Since the early 1990s, it has implemented reforms in an effort to open the economy to international trade. Among these reforms, the government has •± liberalized foreign trade; •± lowered or abolished import tariffs on many goods; •± dismantled parts of the licensing system; •± abolished some forms of labor regulation; and •± sold shares in government-owned companies to the private sector and enacted ﬁnancial reforms, for example allowing state-owned banks to raise funds on the markets by issuing shares. India still bears the marks of the decades of the import substitution strategy. Labor unions and bloated, entrenched incumbent management continue to be vested interest groups, opposing full liberalization and modernization. Labor regulations have remained very pervasive despite early reforms, and in many sectors and regions of India, the government’s role in industry has not disappeared. In recent years, the emerging service, software, and telecommunications sectors have been the most successful, and they have grown without the negative impacts of the government’s industrialization policy. Successful entrepreneurs are beginning to enter more traditional sectors and change the appearance of the industrial landscape. Some Indian multinational firms like TATA, which owns Jaguar and Land Rover among other automotive firms, are becoming global players on the world market.

The Indian Experience of Import Substitution 


Structural Change and Development Strategies were in very close contact and shared ideas on how to develop Japanese exports. MITI helped firms acquire access to foreign technologies and to foreign currency, and played a role in encouraging and coordinating investments in export-oriented sectors. Successful competition on world markets and assistance from the Japanese government have genuinely helped Japanese firms to climb the technology ladder. Export promotion and protectionism. Even when a developing country has the governmental capabilities to implement successful export promotion, it can sometimes be the victim of its own success. One danger successful developing countries face is protectionism that originates in industrialized countries. Protectionist forces within the United States and the European Union have been lobbying to obtain restrictive measures against exports from Japan, China, India, Vietnam, and other successful exporting economies. While these forces have not always had the upper hand, the more successful the export promotion strategies, the stronger these protectionist forces will be. Japanese entrepreneur Soichiro Honda had a lifelong fascination with motorized vehicles. After working in and owning auto repair shops, he created Honda Motors in 1948. Initially, the company produced only cheap motorcycles for the Japanese market. Their low price, comfortable design, ease of use, and fuel efficiency made them very popular, and they soon began to conquer the world market. Honda’s entry into the U.S. market is a good illustration of the firm’s progress as an exporter. In 1959, the Japanese company established the American Honda Motor Company and began to sell motorcycles in the United States. Funds from the Japanese government helped Honda re- engineer its models for American motorcyclists who rode at higher speeds than Japanese riders. Initially, Honda motorcycles tended to break down frequently, but careful re-engineering quickly made them very reliable. By the end of 1964, Honda motorcycles had 62% of the market share in the United States and Honda quickly became the world’s largest motorcycle company. The company did not want to stay confined to the motorcycle market. Its objective was to become a major player in the world’s automobile industry. When the Honda Motor Company launched its first cars on the world market in 1962, consumers worldwide initially dismissed them as low-quality vehicles. Even MITI, which wanted to promote the Japanese automobile sector, sought to limit the number of exporting car companies to only Toyota and Nissan. In spite of this, Honda persevered; because of its low prices, Honda gained access to global markets as its models improved in quality. In 1973, when oil shocks led to sharp increases in gas prices, the fuel-efficient Honda Civic became a huge success. Over the years, the company continued to develop its models, making its cars a symbol of high quality and reliability, and Honda’s production methods became the model for automakers worldwide. Today, Hondas are among the most popular cars worldwide. The Success of Honda Motors’ Exports

Structural Change and Development Strategies in basic commodities to focus on industrial goods would, in theory, be a winning development strategy. As a result, infant industries, newly established firms that did not have a foothold in the global marketplace or the experience and knowledge of longestablished industries, began to form in developing countries and their governments sought strategies for protecting those infant industries against competition from advanced industrialized economies. This was not the first time the issue of infant industries had arisen. When Germany began to industrialize in the 19th century, German economist Friedrich List (1789-1846) argued that while they were developing, infant industries needed temporary protection from more mature industries. 13 The German government had great success instituting protectionist policies such as import tariffs that shielded the emerging industries. Similar to Germany, the less-experienced, newly formed industries in modern-day developing countries were not as efficient as more established firms in advanced economies. Without protection, they would never have the chance to develop and become efficient enough to compete in the global marketplace. In principle, this protection would only be temporary because once the new industries had completed the learning curve, they would be able to compete on equal terms with the more advanced industries. Because infant industry protection was successful in Germany, the argument was quite popular and uncontroversial with respect to modern-day developing countries. Supporters of import substitution readily acknowledged that developing countries needed temporary protection, and agreed to implement import tariffs for that purpose. Unfortunately, the import substitution strategies were disappointing in virtually every developing country that implemented them. While the protection from the competition of foreign goods worked, the new domestic industries had no incentive to become competitive in the world market. Time did not lead to large improvements in productivity or a reduction in costs. Because the new domestic industries did not become competitive, they asked for more protection; as a result, they continued to lack the incentive to stand on their own and a vicious circle set in; repeated calls for protection dulled the incentive to become competitive. Eventually, the protection became permanent and instead of improving economic performance, industrial leaders became representatives of vested interests, blocking reforms that would have opened up the economy. Toward the end of the 1970s, import substitution policies had become widely discredited as a development strategy. Export Promotion and the Asian Miracle While the strategy of import substitution was losing momentum, many Asian economies were implementing export promotion with great success. By employing policies that included preferential credit for exportation firms, easy access to imports, and even government subsidies to help firms offer competitive prices, governments in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and China encouraged industries to develop and export competitive products on world markets. 13 Friedrich List, The National System of Political Economy (Kitchener, ON: Batoche, 2001): 412. 


Structural Change and Development Strategies in basic commodities to focus on industrial goods would, in theory, be a winning development strategy. As a result, infant industries, newly established firms that did not have a foothold in the global marketplace or the experience and knowledge of longestablished industries, began to form in developing countries and their governments sought strategies for protecting those infant industries against competition from advanced industrialized economies. This was not the first time the issue of infant industries had arisen. When Germany began to industrialize in the 19th century, German economist Friedrich List (1789-1846) argued that while they were developing, infant industries needed temporary protection from more mature industries. 13 The German government had great success instituting protectionist policies such as import tariffs that shielded the emerging industries. Similar to Germany, the less-experienced, newly formed industries in modern-day developing countries were not as efficient as more established firms in advanced economies. Without protection, they would never have the chance to develop and become efficient enough to compete in the global marketplace. In principle, this protection would only be temporary because once the new industries had completed the learning curve, they would be able to compete on equal terms with the more advanced industries.

Structural Change and Development Strategies now consider export promotion to be the more successful of the two strategies, though they do not necessarily agree on the causes of its success. More recently, countries like China and Vietnam have also realized success in export promotion. India relied on import substitution for many decades after its independence in 1947, but it abandoned the strategy around the turn of the century and has since tried to focus on export promotion instead. In the next section, we look at the rationales behind each of these strategies as well as why import substitution failed whereas export promotion succeeded. Import Substitution and the Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis Data from the first half of the 20th century showed that the terms of trade for developing countries, the ratio of the export price index to the import price index, tended to decline. Declining terms of trade occur when a country’s export prices grow more slowly than its import prices. In that case, a country must always export more goods in order to be able to afford the same basket of imports. This declining trend in terms of trade for developing economies created the impression that it would continue. The Prebisch-Singer hypothesis states that countries specializing in exports of primary commodities (raw materials, agricultural products) are doomed to experience a decline in their terms of trade. This hypothesis is based on the idea that as the world economy develops, demand for primary commodities will fall behind the demand for manufactured goods. The idea is rooted in the basics of consumer demand: as household income increases, demand for basic goods does not grow as fast as the demand for consumer durables and other manufactured goods. While economists thought that the decline in terms of trade in developing countries would be permanent, it was, in fact, only temporary. The PrebischSinger hypothesis was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s, but it did not pass the test of time, specifically, the oil shocks of the 1970s when the terms of trade became very favorable for oil-exporting countries. Figure 6 shows that since 1980, the trend in terms of trade for developing countries has been virtually flat. Even for OPEC countries, a trend is not easily discernible. Many developing countries have benefited periodically from large commodity price increases in their favor for the commodities they export, be it oil, gas, gold, copper, etc. However, as the global economy has developed and more nations have turned to manufacturing, the supply of oil and raw materials has become increasingly scarce. In addition, productivity and competition have kept the prices of manufactured goods down. There is no discernible trend in the terms of trade for developing countries, as we can see in Figure 6. Note, however, that OPEC countries have had large fluctuations in their terms of trade that were associated with movements in oil prices. After the oil shocks of the 1970s that led to high oil prices, the relative price of oil declined but then rose again around the turn of the millennium. Terms of trade are more volatile for countries that specialize in the export of a particular natural resource such as oil, coffee, cocoa, or copper because the world prices of these goods fluctuate significantly over time.

Structural Change and Development Strategies Industrialization and the Protection of Infant Industries In line with the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, in the 1950s and 1960s many development economists felt that participation in international trade on the basis of specialization in raw materials and natural resources would deliver limited benefits for developing countries and would not deliver strong growth. They advised those countries to follow the path of industrialization that Europe and the United States had taken 150 years earlier. Implementing this strategy meant that domestic industry and manufacturing would replace imports from advanced industrialized countries, a strategy called import substitution . For example, instead of exchanging coffee for steel, developing countries would establish their own steel industries and would not be dependent on the export of coffee to fulfill their need for steel. Because it worked in Europe and the United States in the past, development economists thought that Brazil, India, and other emerging economies should implement this strategy as well. By investing in the industrial sector, there would always be strong demand for industrial goods because these industrial goods had a higher income- elasticity of demand than basic commodities. Income elasticity of demand is the growth rate of demand as income grows by 1%. Industrial goods have a higher incomeelasticity than basic commodities. Therefore, shifting away from specialization FIGURE 6 The Evolution of the Terms of Trade for Developing Countries and OPEC Nations 0 198 0 198 2 198 4 198 6 198 8 199 0 199 2 199 4 199 6 199 8 200 0 200 2 200 4 200 6 200 8 201 0 100 Net terms of trade (2000 = 100) 150 250 200 50 Developing countries (68) OPEC members ( ) The percentage ratio of the export price index to the corresponding import price index is measured relative to the base year 2000.

Structural Change and Development Strategies of complementarity between economic sectors is that which occurs between the government infrastructure sector and the private sector. Without private investment by industrial firms to utilize the different types of infrastructure (roads, railroads, ports, airports, and telecommunication centers) available to move products to market, a government may view the money spent on that infrastructure as wasted. On the other hand, private investment can only be profitable if adequate infrastructure is already in place. Private investors need to be able to transport goods between different places; they do not want to invest in areas that have no roads or rails. Although there are complementarities between various sectors, there may also be coordination problems that occur when each sector makes independent decisions but one sector’s decision depends on another sector’s decision. In our infrastructure investment and private investment example, there is a coordination problem between those responsible for infrastructure, a developing country’s government on one hand and private investors on the other hand. If the government believes that private investors will not invest, then the government will see infrastructure investment, such as the building of a freight rail, as unprofitable and will not invest in it. If the government does not build the rail, then private investors will decide not to invest as well, due to the lack of transportation infrastructure. As a result, neither party makes an investment. The country then remains undeveloped in an inferior coordination equilibrium. 11 A “big push” by the government to finance a modern transportation infrastructure in a developing country, while simultaneously implementing policies to encourage private investment, may attract private investors and make the investment in infrastructure worthwhile. Such coordination on a superior equilibrium is advantageous for development. 11 We will be discussing coordination problems. A 1993 report by the World Bank examined the reasons for the success of East Asian economies such as those in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. 12 Economists have attributed this success in part to the efficient coordination abilities of East Asian governments to gather industry leaders from different sectors, explain the government’s industrial strategy to those leaders, and create communication channels among firms to share information. In other words, the Asian Tigers are an example of successful coordination in the spirit of big push theories. One example of coordination occurred between the export and financial sectors. East Asian governments created development banks that specialized in giving long-term loans for development purposes that would support the growth of export-oriented industrial firms. Government regulations also kept interest rates low in order to encourage private investment. 12 The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy , World Bank Policy Research Reports (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993).

Structural Change and Development Strategies Development Strategies: Import Substitution versus Export Promotion While linkages and coordination between sectors are important components of development strategies, how do we know on which sectors governments should focus? In this context, two important, and opposite, strategies have emerged in the last 50 years: import substitution and export promotion. Import substitution strategies focus on the development of a country’s domestic industry with the objective of a gradual decline in imports of industrial products while the domestic sectors develop. Export promotion strategies focus on developing competitive sectors for the successful export of products to the world market. After World War II, development economists encouraged developing countries to create their own manufacturing base in the hope that they would follow the path of industrialized nations such as Britain, the United States, and Europe. In the 1950s and 1960s, these import substitution strategies were very popular in theory because they appealed to the spirit of independence that arose in many countries during the years of decolonization, but they never delivered any major development successes. Instead, East Asian countries, such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore experienced strong and successful growth due to an entirely different strategy, one based on exporting goods efficiently. Due to the East Asian growth miracle, economists East Asian governments have also invested heavily in infrastructure, be it in the development of road networks, railroads, airports, telecommunications, or water management. Once these forms of infrastructure were in place, domestic and international private investors were encouraged to invest heavily in new plants to make use of newly accessible markets. Beyond infrastructure, governments also strengthened the education sector to ensure a high level of human capital. East Asian countries developed an advanced network of primary and secondary schools and this is how the South Korean secondary education system became one of the best in the world. The Japanese economy’s rapid post-World War II growth was due in large part to the government’s active role in coordinating the investments of the large private firms across industrial sectors. The Japanese government avoided the buildup of excess capacity and price wars among the large export firms through industrial licensing, requiring firms to receive government approval for large-scale investments. In reviewing proposals and issuing approvals, the government also received information about the firms’ investment projects. Whenever competing firms put similar investment projects forward, the government often asked these firms to cooperate. In the 1960s and 1970s, the South Korean government followed the Japanese model and coordinated the investments of large private firms, such as in the microchip production sector. East Asian governments have used a broad spectrum of government intervention, not only industrial licensing but also government procurement, export obligations, and subsidies to encourage firms to achieve economies of scale.

Structural Change and Development Strategies suppliers for a given sector, and forward linkages , effects on downstream sectors that are clients of a given sector. Japan is an example that illustrates these intersectoral linkages. In the 1960s, the Japanese government wanted to focus on developing the country’s car industry and was willing to contribute resources and implement a combination of tax incentives and subsidies in order to stimulate its growth. The developing car industry needed parts from sectors that were located upstream (steel, glass, tires, engines, etc.), which increased the demand for these parts and subsequently encouraged the development of the sectors that produced them. Entrepreneurs saw the demand for these sectors as lucrative business opportunities and established new businesses to serve the developing car industry. The increased demand for capital also helped to develop capital markets. Banks lending to the car industry tried to attract more deposits and competed to offer customers attractive incentives, which led to growth in the banking sector. These backward linkages helped strengthen the sectors that supported the car industry, both in manufacturing and capital markets. Downstream sectors that needed cars could now purchase domestic Japanese models that were cheaper than foreign models and more adaptable to local conditions. More cars on the country’s highways encouraged road construction and the expansion of the transportation infrastructure. The increase in infrastructure reduced transportation costs and had positive effects for the Japanese economy as a whole. Balanced versus unbalanced. From a purely theoretical point of view, the argument for balanced growth appears to be more sensible and have a more solid foundation in economics. It is, however, based on the premise that a government has the administrative capacity to help each sector equally, or to assist in such a way as to achieve equal growth in all sectors. Despite the best intentions, the administrative capacity of a government might be too deficient to attain this goal. Government economic policy usually focuses on one priority at a time and is often unable to pay equal attention to all sectors of the economy at the same time. If that is the case, a simultaneous focus on a few sectors, in a strategy of unbalanced growth, may help develop other sectors by means of intersectoral linkages and subsequently help the entire economy to grow. To summarize, balanced growth is the theoretical ideal. In practice, however, unbalanced growth is more likely to succeed because it requires less administrative government capabilities and intersectoral linkages will correct the imbalances created by government policy. Big Push Theories Theories that promote the idea that development can only be successful when a government makes efforts to expand, simultaneously, various sectors on a very large scale are referred to as big push theories . These theories appeal to the complementarities between economic sectors. Complementarities between two objects exist when the objects must be combined in certain proportions in order to be effective. A car needs four wheels and a body, otherwise it cannot transport passengers; therefore, the body of the car and the wheels are complementary. Certain sectors require a combination of labor and capital, such as construction workers and bulldozers in the building industry. A good example

Certain sectors require a combination of labor and capital, such as construction workers and bulldozers in the building industry. A good example

Structural Change and Development Strategies Chapter Summary Structural Change The process of economic development implies a shift in employment and economic activity from agriculture to industry. As economies continue to develop, another shift occurs from the industry sector to that of services. During the process of development, some sectors expand while others shrink. The Lewis Model of Structural Change The Lewis model examines how labor can be transferred from the traditional agricultural sector to a profitable modern industrial sector, inducing capital accumulation in the latter and economic development in the country as a whole. The quality of institutions in different countries is a major reason why the predictions of the Lewis model fail to materialize. Weak institutions are the reason for a large and inefficient informal sector, for private investors’ preference to invest capital abroad rather than in the domestic economy, and for the presence of large inefficiencies in government-sponsored industrial sectors. The Harris-Todaro Model of Rural to Urban Migration The Harris-Todaro model analyzes the motivations for migration from the countryside to the cities on the basis of the expected lifetime income in rural versus urban areas. People may expect a high income when moving to a city, but in reality they might become unemployed. If there is a fixed minimum wage level in the modern urban sector that is higher than the wage in the traditional agricultural sector, the Harris-Todaro model predicts that there will be excess migration to the cities, thus generating urban unemployment. Rural inhabitants with more education will be more tempted to migrate than those with less education. Government programs to create jobs for the urban unemployed may end up increasing unemployment, as they will tend to increase rural to urban migration. Development Strategies: Sectoral Growth Theories promoting balanced growth call for equal growth rates across sectors, while theories in favor of unbalanced growth rates call for higher growth in priority sectors. Strategies for balanced growth should theoretically lead to faster growth, but governments may not have the administrative capabilities to manage balanced growth and may have to focus on priority sectors. In that case, it is best to focus on the development of sectors whose expansion might have the most positive effects on upstream and downstream sectors. Big-push theories state that governments should encourage the simultaneous development of different sectors on a scale large enough to benefit the whole economy. This is especially true for sectors that are complementary to each other, i.e., where the development of one sector makes the development of the other sector more attractive. Such government coordination may increase the attractiveness of private investment and pull countries out of poverty. Development Strategies: Import Substitution versus Export Promotion Import substitution strategies aim at relying less on the import of industrial goods and more on developing a country’s domestic industrial base. One of the primary rationales for these policies was the fear that the prices of industrial goods would increase more than the prices of raw materials, a deterioration of the terms of trade for developing countries. However, since the 1970s this fear has proved largely unfounded. In order to create a new industrial basis as a substitution for imports, the need to temporarily protect infant industries against competition from established industrial countries has increased. Unfortunately, protected industries often lack the incentives to become more competitive and protection then tends to become permanent. The success of Asian economies in recent decades is based on export promotion, a strategy of encouraging certain sectors to compete and gain important market shares on the world market. Government has played a significant role in helping export firms to expand their global market shares. However, many governments in developing countries do not have the administrative capabilities to fulfill such a role.

Structural Change and Development Strategies The Foreign Aid Controversy Jeffrey Sachs and other proponents of increased foreign aid argue that the poorest countries are stuck in a poverty trap with too few resources to invest in developing their economies and that more foreign aid could create a big push. Skeptics such as William Easterly argue that foreign aid in previous decades has not led to successful growth even though some countries may have benefited from large sums. A significant problem is caused by large portions of foreign aid that have been diverted by corrupt officials. A more bottom-up approach is needed to identify valuable aid projects, while a more rigorous evaluation of aid projects is needed to improve the use of resources.

Modify the Lewis model and assume that there is a strictly positive marginal product of labor in the traditional sector. Use figures with production functions in the traditional and the modern sectors to show what the equilibrium is when no one wants to move away from agriculture. What assumptions do you have to make about production functions to arrive at the conclusion that fewer people will end up in agriculture? 2. Use the same starting point as in the previous question. Derive the demand for labor in the traditional and in the modern sectors. Show graphically what the characteristics of the equilibrium would look like when no one wants to change sectors. 3. Take the Lewis model and discuss what the effect of a declining trend in the terms of trade would be for the modern sector in a developing country on the country’s growth path and on the rural to urban migration. 4. What is the main difference in prediction between the Lewis model and the HarrisTodaro model on rural to urban migration? 5. Given the validity of the Harris-Todaro model, what would you tell a government that wanted to eliminate urban unemployment by creating government-subsidized jobs in its cities? 6.
