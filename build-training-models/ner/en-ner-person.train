Anarchism  Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self-governed voluntary institutions, but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations.
Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.
While anti-statism is central, anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.
As an anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy.
Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.
There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.
Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.
Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.
Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.
Etymology and terminology.
The term "anarchism" is a compound word composed from the word "anarchy" and the suffix "-ism", themselves derived respectively from the Greek ἀναρχία, i.e. "anarchy" (from ἄναρχος, "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the privative prefix ἀν("an-", i.e. "without") and ἀρχός, "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf.
"archon" or ἀρχή, "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix -ισμός or -ισμα ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal infinitive suffix -ίζειν, "-izein").
The first known use of this word was in 1539.
Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as  <START:person> Robespierre <END>  did the Hébertists) although few shared many views of later anarchists.
There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  and  <START:person> Wilhelm Weitling <END> , but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.
The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END> , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century.
Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.
On the other hand, some use "libertarianism" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "libertarian anarchism".
History.
Origins.
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of Taoist philosopher  <START:person> Laozi <END> , and in later centuries by  <START:person> Zhuangzi <END>  and  <START:person> Bao Jingyan <END> .
 <START:person> Zhuangzi <END> 's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist.
 <START:person> Zhuangzi <END>  wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail.
A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation."
 <START:person> Diogenes <END>  of Sinope and the Cynics, their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics.
 <START:person> Jesus <END>  is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition.
 <START:person> Georges Lechartier <END>  wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles."
In early Islamic history, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate, where the  <START:person> Kharijites <END>  insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.
Later, some Muslim scholars, such as  <START:person> Amer al-Basri <END>  and  <START:person> Abu Hanifa <END> , led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the waqf (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs.
But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible.
This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry.
The French renaissance political philosopher  <START:person> Étienne de La Boétie <END>  wrote in his most famous work the "Discourse on Voluntary Servitude" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.
The radical Protestant Christian  <START:person> Gerrard Winstanley <END>  and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.
The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the English Civil War, as a term of abuse, used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents.
By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the "Enragés", began to use the term positively, in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as oxymoronic.
By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly  <START:person> Jean-Jacques Rousseau <END> 's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution,  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  was, according to  <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END> , "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while  <START:person> Godwin <END>  attached his anarchist ideas to an early  <START:person> Edmund Burke <END> .
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'.
He argued in "Political Justice" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance.
He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force.
Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power.
Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.
His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage.
He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation.
In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.
The French  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END>  is regarded as the first "self-proclaimed" anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, "What is Property?,"
published in 1840.
It is for this reason that some claim  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  as the founder of modern anarchist theory.
He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order."
In "What is Property?"
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  answers with the famous accusation "Property is theft."
In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish.
He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use.
Later, however,  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  added that "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.
His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.
The anarcho-communist  <START:person> Joseph Déjacque <END>  was the first person to describe himself as "libertarian".
Unlike  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END> , he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature."
In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher  <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  published the book, "The Ego and Its Own," which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism.
French anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included  <START:person> Anselme Bellegarrigue <END> ,  <START:person> Ernest Coeurderoy <END> ,  <START:person> Joseph Déjacque <END>  and  <START:person> Pierre Joseph Proudhon <END> .
First International and the Paris Commune.
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.
After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.
In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal "El Porvenir" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by  <START:person> Proudhon <END> ´s ideas.
The Catalan politician  <START:person> Francesc Pi <END>  i  <START:person> Margall <END>  became the principal translator of  <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party.
According to  <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's."
According to the "Encyclopedia Britannica" "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y  <START:person> Margall <END>  attempted to establish a decentralized, or "cantonalist," political system on Proudhonian lines."
In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of  <START:person> Proudhon <END> , Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats.
Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation.
 <START:person> Karl Marx <END>  became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's followers, the mutualists, opposed  <START:person> Marx <END> 's state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.
 <START:person> Woodcock <END>  also reports that the American individualist anarchists  <START:person> Lysander Spooner <END>  and  <START:person> William B. Greene <END>  had been members of the First International.
In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary  <START:person> Mikhail Bakunin <END>  and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).
They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.
At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction.
Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with  <START:person> Marx <END>  and  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  as their respective figureheads.
 <START:person> Bakunin <END>  characterised  <START:person> Marx <END> 's ideas as centralist and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against.
Anarchist historian  <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London.
One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's Swiss supporters.
Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously.
Most of them were clearly directed against  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  and his followers."
In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  and  <START:person> James Guillaume <END>  were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.
In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.
The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871.
The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War.
Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune.
They included  <START:person> Louise Michel <END> , the Reclus brothers, and  <START:person> Eugene Varlin <END>  (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards).
As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised ...
Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  on French radical ideas.
Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's and  <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's ideas ( <START:person> Proudhon <END> , like  <START:person> Bakunin <END> , had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 ... and for federation of communes).
Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.
 <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  states: a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organisation of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists  <START:person> Courbet <END> ,  <START:person> Longuet <END> , and  <START:person> Vermorel <END> , the libertarian collectivists Varlin,  <START:person> Malon <END> , and  <START:person> Lefrangais <END> , and the bakuninists  <START:person> Elie <END>  and  <START:person> Elisée Reclus <END>  and  <START:person> Louise Michel <END> .
Organised labour.
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organisation of labour."
In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.
In response, unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event.
On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.
The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.
A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.
In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.
Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.
Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer.
The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement.
Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution.
The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day.
In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made.
The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.
Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.
In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including  <START:person> Errico Malatesta <END> ,  <START:person> Pierre Monatte <END> ,  <START:person> Luigi Fabbri <END> ,  <START:person> Benoît Broutchoux <END> ,  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> ,  <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END> , and  <START:person> Christiaan Cornelissen <END> .
Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism.
A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism).
 <START:person> Malatesta <END>  and  <START:person> Monatte <END>  were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while  <START:person> Malatesta <END>  did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.
He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials.
 <START:person> Malatesta <END>  warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain.
The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.
Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War.
The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America.
In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation.
The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions."
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism.
Some anarchists, such as  <START:person> Johann Most <END> , advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda."
By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, regicides, and tyrannicides.
From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal 'expropriations'."
Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society.
Moreover, they were clearly meant to be "exemplary" invitations to revolt.".
France's  <START:person> Bonnot Gang <END>  was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts.
 <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END>  thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite".
A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement.
The anarcho-syndicalist,  <START:person> Fernand Pelloutier <END> , argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."
State repression (including the infamous 1894 French "lois scélérates") of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts.
The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many "communards" to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including  <START:person> Tsar Alexander II <END>  of Russia, President  <START:person> Sadi Carnot <END>  of France, Empress  <START:person> Elisabeth <END>  of Austria, King Umberto I of Italy, President  <START:person> William McKinley <END>  of the United States, King  <START:person> Carlos <END>  I of Portugal and King  <START:person> George <END>  I of Greece.
 <START:person> McKinley <END> 's assassin  <START:person> Leon Czolgosz <END>  claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> .
Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the 1917 October Revolution.
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s.
Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.
However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, which the new government repressed.
Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine.
There, in the Free Territory, they fought in the civil war against the Whites (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END> , who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
Expelled American anarchists  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END>  and  <START:person> Alexander Berkman <END>  were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia.
Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised.
For them,  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally.
Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.
In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International.
The revolutionary wave of 1917–23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism.
In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists  <START:person> Gustav Landauer <END> ,  <START:person> Silvio Gesell <END>  and  <START:person> Erich Mühsam <END>  had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures.
In the Italian events known as the "biennio rosso" the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "Umanita Nova", its daily paper) grew accordingly ... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces.
In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist  <START:person> Ricardo Flores Magón <END> .
In Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END> , concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.
Their 1926 manifesto, called the "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)", was supported.
Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America.
Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.
In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents  <START:person> Volin <END>  and  <START:person> Sebastien Faure <END> .
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Conflicts with European fascist regimes.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state.
Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists.
Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation "Arditi del Popolo", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922.
The veteran Italian anarchist,  <START:person> Luigi Fabbri <END> , was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution."
In France, where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy.
Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II.
In Germany the anarchist  <START:person> Erich Mühsam <END>  was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin.
 <START:person> Joseph Goebbels <END> , the Nazi propaganda minister, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives."
Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg, Brandenburg and finally, Oranienburg.
On 2 February 1934,  <START:person> Mühsam <END>  was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934,  <START:person> Mühsam <END>  was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
Spanish Revolution.
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory.
But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power.
Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).
In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land.
But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union.
The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante.
Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment.
Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes.
Anarchist historian  <START:person> Sam Dolgoff <END>  estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists.
The prominent Italian anarchist  <START:person> Camillo Berneri <END> , who volunteered to fight against  <START:person> Franco <END>  was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party.
Post-war years.
Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France.
The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District.
In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association).
From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.
In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist  <START:person> Federazione Anarchica Italiana <END>  was founded in Italy.
Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded.
An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948.
After World War II, an appeal in the "Fraye Arbeter Shtime" detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them.
By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation.
The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and  <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END>  wrote for its organ, "Die Freie Gesellschaft", which survived until 1953.
In 1956 the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded.
In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation.
The Syndicalist Workers' Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of Solidarity Federation's earliest predecessors.
It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain.
Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as  <START:person> Albert Camus <END> ,  <START:person> Herbert Read <END> ,  <START:person> Paul Goodman <END> ,  <START:person> Dwight Macdonald <END> ,  <START:person> Allen Ginsberg <END> ,  <START:person> George Woodcock <END> ,  <START:person> Leopold Kohr <END> ,  <START:person> Julian Beck <END> ,  <START:person> John Cage <END>  and the French Surrealist group led by  <START:person> André Breton <END> , which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.
Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists  <START:person> Ammon Hennacy <END>  and  <START:person> Dorothy Day <END> .
Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War."
The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in  <START:person> Robert Graham <END> 's , "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".
Contemporary anarchism.
A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s.
Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts.
In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the Fédération Anarchiste), the  <START:person> Federazione Anarchica Italiana <END>  of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.
In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols.
The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain.
In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.
Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged.
Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s.
Anarchist anthropologist  <START:person> David Graeber <END>  and anarchist historian  <START:person> Andrej Grubacic <END>  have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous, feminist, ecological and cultural-critical ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.
Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.
Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight, and the World Economic Forum.
Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police.
These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as "black blocs"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.
A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999.
According to anarchist scholar  <START:person> Simon Critchley <END> , "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism ...
One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."
International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity.
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT.
CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.
Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation; the CNT-AIT in France; the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy; in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation.
The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World, claiming 2,000 paying members, and the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.
Anarchist schools of thought.
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist anarchism and social anarchism, which have some different origins, values and evolution.
The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty, i.e. opposition to state or social control over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, "recognizing equality of entitlement".
In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.
A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.
One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "anarchism without adjectives", a call for toleration first adopted by  <START:person> Fernando Tarrida del Mármol <END>  in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time.
In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e.
collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
Classical anarchist schools of thought.
Mutualism.
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END>  in France and others in the United States.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order."
It is important to recognize that  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance.
For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance,  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform.
According to the American mutualist  <START:person> William Batchelder Greene <END> , each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount."
Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."
Individualist anarchism.
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.
Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.
In 1793,  <START:person> William Godwin <END> , who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote "Political Justice", which some consider the first expression of anarchism.
 <START:person> Godwin <END> , a philosophical anarchist, from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.
An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German  <START:person> Max Stirner <END> .
 <START:person> Stirner <END> 's "The Ego and Its Own", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.
According to  <START:person> Stirner <END> , the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality.
To Stirner, rights were "spooks" in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality".
 <START:person> Stirner <END>  advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which  <START:person> Stirner <END>  proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state.
Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.
"Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of  <START:person> Stirner <END> 's philosophy.
It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist  <START:person> John Henry Mackay <END> .
 <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical published.
For American anarchist historian  <START:person> Eunice Minette Schuster <END>  "It is apparent ... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  and  <START:person> Stephen Pearl Andrews <END>  ...  <START:person> William B. Greene <END>  presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.".  <START:person> Henry David Thoreau <END>  (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe.
 <START:person> Thoreau <END>  was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist.
He is best known for his books "Walden", a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, "Civil Disobedience", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.
Later  <START:person> Benjamin Tucker <END>  fused  <START:person> Stirner <END> 's egoism with the economics of  <START:person> Warren <END>  and  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  in his eclectic influential publication "Liberty".
From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, free love and birth control advocates (see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex), individualist naturists nudists (see anarcho-naturism), freethought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation (see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France).
These authors and activists included  <START:person> Oscar Wilde <END> ,  <START:person> Emile Armand <END> ,  <START:person> Han Ryner <END> ,  <START:person> Henri Zisly <END> ,  <START:person> Renzo Novatore <END> ,  <START:person> Miguel Gimenez Igualada <END> ,  <START:person> Adolf Brand <END>  and  <START:person> Lev Chernyi <END>  among others.
Social anarchism.
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or coercion.
It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.
Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for personal property), and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid.
Collectivist anarchism.
Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with  <START:person> Mikhail Bakunin <END>  and  <START:person> Johann Most <END> .
Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised.
This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "propaganda by the deed", which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.
However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism.
This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system".
Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.
Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
Anarcho-communism.
Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, markets, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".
Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.
Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.
Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International.
The theoretical work of  <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END>  took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections.
To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution.
Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war,  <START:person> Hitler <END> ,  <START:person> Mussolini <END> , Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself.
During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END>  worked to create and defend – through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine – anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.
Anarcho-syndicalism. Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement.
Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.
The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' solidarity, Direct action and Workers' self-management Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.
Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing.
They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.
 <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END>  was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.
He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-Syndicalism".
The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries.
The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement.
It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.
Post-classical schools of thought.
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.
Green anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism, and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology.
Anarcha-feminism (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism.
It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association.
Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state.
In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa.
 <START:person> L. Susan Brown <END>  claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".
Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END>  and  <START:person> Voltairine de Cleyre <END> .
Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see non-violence).
It developed "mostly in the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War".
Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity.
Its main proponents included  <START:person> Leo Tolstoy <END> ,  <START:person> Dorothy Day <END> ,  <START:person> Ammon Hennacy <END> , and  <START:person> Jacques Ellul <END> .
Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of  <START:person> Dielo Truda <END> 's "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)".
The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups.
The "Platform" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.
Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.
In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists Voline and  <START:person> Sébastien Faure <END> .
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional Left-wing politics.
Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality.
Influenced by the work of  <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  and by the Marxist Situationist International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice.
It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses.
Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation.
Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.
Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism, autonomist marxism, post-left anarchy, Situationist International, and postcolonialism.
Left-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.
Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market.
Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics, study of law and economics, and public choice theory.
There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.
Internal issues and debates.
Anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common.
The compatibility of capitalism, nationalism, and religion with anarchism is widely disputed.
Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism, communism and capitalism.
Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.
Phenomena such as civilization, technology (e.g.
within anarcho-primitivism and insurrectionary anarchism), and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.
On a tactical level, while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the Nihilist movement), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence, counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society.
About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.
The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory.
Topics of interest.
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
Free love.
An important current within anarchism is free love.
Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty.
Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.
The most important American free love journal was "Lucifer the Lightbearer" (1883–1907) edited by  <START:person> Moses Harman <END>  and  <START:person> Lois Waisbrooker <END> , but also there existed  <START:person> Ezra Heywood <END>  and  <START:person> Angela Heywood <END> 's "The Word" (1872–1890, 1892–1893).
"Free Society" (1895–1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897–1904 as "Free Society") was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.
The publication advocated free love and women's rights, and critiqued "Comstockery" – censorship of sexual information.
Also  <START:person> M. E. Lazarus <END>  was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.
In New York City's Greenwich Village, bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now.
They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical  <START:person> Edna St. Vincent Millay <END>  and the lesbian anarchist  <START:person> Margaret Anderson <END>  were prominent among them.
Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> , among others.
 <START:person> Magnus Hirschfeld <END>  noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights.
Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public."
In fact, before Goldman, heterosexual anarchist  <START:person> Robert Reitzel <END>  (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal "Der arme  <START:person> Teufel <END> ".
In Argentina anarcha-feminist  <START:person> Virginia Bolten <END>  published the newspaper called "La Voz de la Mujer" (English: The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in  <START:person> Rosario <END>  between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.
In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was  <START:person> Emile Armand <END> .
He proposed the concept of "la camaraderie amoureuse" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults.
He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory.
In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and  <START:person> John Henry Mackay <END>  were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.
 <START:person> Mujeres Libres <END>  was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women.
It was founded in 1936 by  <START:person> Lucía Sánchez Saornil <END> , Mercedes Comaposada and  <START:person> Amparo Poch <END>  y Gascón and had approximately 30,000 members.
The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for women's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel.
In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.
 <START:person> Lucía Sánchez Saornil <END>  was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation  <START:person> Mujeres Libres <END>  who was open about her lesbianism.
She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment.
More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual "The Joy of Sex".
The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-hedonist philosopher  <START:person> Michel Onfray <END>  in such works as "Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire" (2000) and "L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques" (2002).
Libertarian education and freethought.
For English anarchist  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  education was "the main means by which change would be achieved."
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.
For  <START:person> Godwin <END>  education had to have "A respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion," "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives," and "A concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school."
In his "Political Justice" he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government".
Early American anarchist  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established.
 <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called "The False Principle of our Education".
In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation.
Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".
In the United States "freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters.
A number of contributors to "Liberty" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism.
The individualist anarchist  <START:person> George MacDonald <END>  was a co-editor of "Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker".
 <START:person> E.C. Walker <END>  was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer"".
"Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer", "Freethought" and "The Truth Seeker" appeared in "Liberty"...
The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".
In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker  <START:person> Francesc Ferrer <END>  i Guàrdia established "modern" or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.
The schools' stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting".
Fiercely anti-clerical,  <START:person> Ferrer <END>  believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.
 <START:person> Murray Bookchin <END>  wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence.
Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was  <START:person> Francisco Ferrer <END> 's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally."
 <START:person> La Escuela Moderna <END> , and  <START:person> Ferrer <END> 's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of "Modern Schools" in the United States, Cuba, South America and London.
The first of these was started in New York City in 1911.
It also inspired the Italian newspaper "Università popolare", founded in 1901.
Russian christian anarchist  <START:person> Leo Tolstoy <END>  established a school for peasant children on his estate.
 <START:person> Tolstoy <END> 's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.
 <START:person> Tolstoy <END>  established a conceptual difference between education and culture.
He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free.
[Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".
For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".
A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches.
Experiments in Germany led to  <START:person> A. S. Neill <END>  founding what became Summerhill School in 1921.
Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.
However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of  <START:person> Ferrer <END>  by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se.
The term deschooling was popularised by  <START:person> Ivan Illich <END> , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms.
Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics.
European history professor  <START:person> Carl Landauer <END> , in his book "European Socialism" argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force."
He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity."
Acid  An acid (from the Latin "acidus/acēre" meaning "sour") is a chemical substance whose aqueous solutions are characterized by a sour taste, the ability to turn blue litmus red, and the ability to react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. Aqueous solutions of acids have a pH of less than 7. Non-aqueous acids are usually formed when an anion reacts with one or more positively charged hydrogen cations.
A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution.
Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic.
There are three common definitions for acids: the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition, and the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  definition.
The  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+), or more accurately, hydronium ions (H3O+), when dissolved in water.
The Brønsted-Lowry definition is an expansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor.
By this definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid.
Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or N-H fragments.
A  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid is a substance that can accept a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond.
Examples of  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids include all metal cations, and electron-deficient molecules such as boron trifluoride and aluminium trichloride.
Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and tartaric acid (a solid used in baking).
As these examples show, acids can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from solids, liquids, or gases.
Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.
Definitions and concepts.
Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.
Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions, or can be dissolved in water, so the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant.
The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified, acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H+) from an acid to a base.
Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions.
Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as  <START:person> Lewis <END>  bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
 <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acids.
The Swedish chemist  <START:person> Svante Arrhenius <END>  attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions (H+) or protons in 1884.
An  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water.
Note that chemists often write H+("aq") and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a proton, does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H3O+.
Thus, an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water.
This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and hydroxide (OH−) ions: In pure water the majority of molecules are H2O, but the molecules are constantly dissociating and re-associating, and at any time a small number of the molecules are hydronium and an equal number are hydroxide.
Because the numbers are equal, pure water is neutral (not acidic or basic).
An  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  base, on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water, hence decreasing the concentration of hydronium.
The constant association and disassociation of H2O molecules forms an equilibrium in which any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide, thus an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, with an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  base increasing it.
In an acid, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10−7 moles per liter.
Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have a pH of less than 7. Brønsted-Lowry acids.
While the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope.
In 1923 chemists  <START:person> Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Martin Lowry <END>  independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton.
A Brønsted-Lowry acid (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base.
Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  theory.
Consider the following reactions of acetic acid (CH3COOH), the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste: Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CH3COOH acts as an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid because it acts as a source of H3O+ when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water.
In the second example CH3COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH3), but cannot be described using the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium.
Brønsted-Lowry theory can also be used to describe molecular compounds, whereas  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acids must be ionic compounds.
Hydrogen chloride (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride, NH4Cl.
In aqueous solution HCl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions.
The following reactions illustrate the limitations of  <START:person> Arrhenius <END> 's definition: As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute.
The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions.
In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in benzene) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH3 combine to form the solid.
 <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids.
A third concept was proposed in 1923 by  <START:person> Gilbert N. Lewis <END>  which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer.
A  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.
Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers.
All Brønsted acids are also  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids, but not all  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids are Brønsted acids.
Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry.
In the first reaction a fluoride ion, F−, gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate.
Fluoride "loses" a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion.
BF3 is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride.
This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer.
The second reaction can be described using either theory.
A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a  <START:person> Lewis <END>  base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion.
The species that gains the electron pair is the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H3O+ gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen.
Depending on the context, a  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile.
Dissociation and equilibrium.
Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA H+ + A−, where HA represents the acid and A− is the conjugate base.
Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton (protonation and deprotonation, respectively).
Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA+ H+ + A. In solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base.
The equilibrium constant "K" is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution.
Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H2O] means "the concentration of H2O".
The acid dissociation constant "K"a is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions.
The numerical value of "K"a is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H+.
The stronger of two acids will have a higher "K"a than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton.
Because the range of possible values for "K"a spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p"K"a is more frequently used, where p"K"a = -log10 "K"a.
Stronger acids have a smaller p"K"a than weaker acids.
Experimentally determined p"K"a at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.
Nomenclature.
In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their anions.
That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.
For example, HCl has chloride as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid.
In the IUPAC naming system, "aqueous" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound.
Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride.
The prefix "hydro-" is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.
Classical naming system: Acid strength.
The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton.
A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA.
In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution.
Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%.
The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+.
Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond.
Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.
Stronger acids have a larger "K"a and a more negative p"K"a than weaker acids.
Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids.
A common example is toluenesulfonic acid (tosylic acid).
Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids.
In fact, polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.
Superacids are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid.
Examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid, magic acid and perchloric acid.
Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline hydronium "salts".
They can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations.
While "K"a measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.
The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's "K"a.
Chemical characteristics.
Monoprotic acids.
Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA): Common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO3).
On the other hand, for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid.
Examples in organic acids include formic acid (HCOOH), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and benzoic acid (C6H5COOH).
Polyprotic acids.
Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule.
Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).
A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H2A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH.
Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, Ka1 and Ka2.
The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., "K"a1 > "K"a2.
For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion (HSO4−), for which "K"a1 is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion (SO42−), wherein the "K"a2 is intermediate strength.
The large "K"a1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid.
In a similar manner, the weak unstable carbonic acid (H2CO3) can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) and lose a second to form carbonate anion (CO32−).
Both "K"a values are small, but "K"a1 > "K"a2 .
A triprotic acid (H3A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where "K"a1 > "K"a2 > "K"a3.
An inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4), usually just called phosphoric acid.
All three protons can be successively lost to yield H2PO4−, then HPO42−, and finally PO43−, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called phosphate.
Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive "K"a values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.
An organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid, which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion.
Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution.
The fractional concentration, "α" (alpha), for each species can be calculated.
For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H2A, HA−, and A2−.
The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H+]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases: A plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given "K"1 and "K"2, is known as a Bjerrum plot.
A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general "n" -protic acid that has been deprotonated "i" -times: where K0 = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.
Neutralization.
Neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a salt and neutralized base; for example, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water: Neutralization is the basis of titration, where a pH indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid.
It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.
Neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt.
An example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride, which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia.
Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g.
sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide.
Weak acid–weak base equilibrium.
In order for a protonated acid to lose a proton, the pH of the system must rise above the p"K"a of the acid.
The decreased concentration of H+ in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid).
In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H+ concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form.
Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions.
Applications of acids.
There are numerous uses for acids.
Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling.
They may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery, such as sulfuric acid in a car battery.
Strong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing.
For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.
In the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts.
For example, nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer.
Additionally, carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols, to produce esters.
Acids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives.
Phosphoric acid, for example, is a component of cola drinks.
Acetic acid is used in day-to-day life as vinegar.
Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.
Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.
Tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind.
Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids.
Citric acid is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits.
Oxalic acid is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in carambola and rhubarb; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.
Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla (Indian gooseberry), lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.
Certain acids are used as drugs.
Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.
Acids play important roles in the human body.
The hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules.
Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues.
Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues.
Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA and RNA and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes.
Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.
Acid catalysis.
Acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline.
Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions.
In biochemistry, many enzymes employ acid catalysis.
Biological occurrence.
Many biologically important molecules are acids.
Nucleic acids, which contain acidic phosphate groups, include DNA and RNA.
Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring.
DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits.
Cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids.
An α-amino acid has a central carbon (the α or "alpha" carbon) which is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group (thus they are carboxylic acids), an amino group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group.
The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid.
In glycine, the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen.
With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the .
Peptidoglycan, found in some bacterial cell walls contains some -amino acids.
At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO−) and the basic amine group (-NH2) gains a proton (-NH3+).
The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion, with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains.
Aspartic acid, for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of −1 at physiological pH.
Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology.
These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end.
The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer, a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic phosphate "head" groups.
Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.
In humans and many other animals, hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, pepsinogen into the enzyme, pepsin.
Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce formic acid.
Acid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing.
Oxygen gas (O2) drives cellular respiration, the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food, producing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs, and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation.
For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat, releasing CO2 into the blood stream.
In aqueous solutions such as blood CO2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion.
It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO2 and resupplying the cells with O2.  Cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior.
Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base).
For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods.
The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and cytosol, both aqueous environments.
When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer.
Acids that lose a proton at the intracellular pH will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target.
Ibuprofen, aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids.
Common acids.
Sulfonic acids.
A sulfonic acid has the general formula RS(=O)2–OH, where R is an organic radical.
Carboxylic acids.
A carboxylic acid has the general formula R-C(O)OH, where R is an organic radical.
The carboxyl group -C(O)OH contains a carbonyl group, C=O, and a hydroxyl group, O-H.
Halogenated carboxylic acids.
Halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength, so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid.
Vinylogous carboxylic acids.
Normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group.
In vinylogous carboxylic acids, a carbon-carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.
Adventure  An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.
It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.
Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.
The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.
Motivation.
Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g.
fear) or positive (e.g.
flow), and which can be detrimental as stated by the Yerkes-Dodson law.
For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself.
According to adventurer  <START:person> André Malraux <END> , in his "La Condition Humaine" (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".
Similarly,  <START:person> Helen Keller <END>  stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."
Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism.
Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer  <START:person> Jason Lewis <END> , for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren.
Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.
Adventure in mythology.
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's "The Odyssey".
Mythologist  <START:person> Joseph Campbell <END>  discussed his notion of the monomyth in his book, "The Hero with a Thousand Faces".
 <START:person> Campbell <END>  proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.
The knight errant was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.
The adventure novel exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as "Star Wars" and "The Raiders of the Lost Ark".
Articles of Confederation  The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was a document signed amongst the thirteen original colonies that established the United States of America as a confederation of sovereign states and served as its first constitution.
Its drafting by a committee appointed by the Second Continental Congress began on July 12, 1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for ratification in late 1777.
The formal ratification by all thirteen states was completed in early 1781.
Even when not yet ratified, the Articles provided domestic and international legitimacy for the Continental Congress to direct the American Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with Europe and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations.
Nevertheless, the weakness of the government created by the Articles became a matter of concern for key nationalists.
On March 4, 1789, the general government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the United States Constitution.
The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government with a chief executive (the president), courts, and taxing powers.
Background and context.
The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and  <START:person> Benjamin Franklin <END> 's proposed Albany Plan of Union, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems.
The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it.
Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown.
With civil disobedience resulting in coercive and intolerable acts, and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it.
In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government to run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence.
It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not.
During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority.
It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.
To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it.
In early 1776,  <START:person> Thomas Paine <END>  argued in the closing pages of the first edition of "Common Sense" that the “custom of nations” demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain.
The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch.
Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a “manifesto” which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners.
Without such a declaration,  <START:person> Paine <END>  concluded, “[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.”
Beyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations.
On June 7, 1776,  <START:person> Richard Henry Lee <END>  introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve “to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances” and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states.
Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation.
The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established “a firm league” among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.
Drafting.
On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.
The committee met repeatedly, and chairman  <START:person> John Dickinson <END>  presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776.
There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures.
The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.
In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777; the final draft of the Articles served as the de facto system of government used by the Congress ("the United States in Congress assembled") until it became de jure by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the Congress of the Confederation.
Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government.
The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government.
It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories.
Article XIII stipulated that "their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state" and "the Union shall be perpetual".
 <START:person> John Dickinson <END> 's and  <START:person> Benjamin Franklin <END> 's handwritten drafts of the Articles of Confederation are housed at the National Archives in Washington, DC.
Operation.
The Articles were created by delegates from the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a need to have "a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States."
After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government.
There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base.
The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.
In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the United States Constitution and the new government began operations in 1789.
Ratification.
Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777: "Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states.
Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties..." The document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all 13 states.
The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777; the thirteenth state to ratify was Maryland on February 2, 1781.
A ceremonial confirmation of this thirteenth, final ratification took place in the Congress on March 1, 1781 at high noon.
Dates of ratification are: The ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by the refusal of some states to rescind their claims to land in the West.
Maryland was the last holdout; it refused to go along until Virginia and New York agreed to cede their claims in the Ohio River Valley.
It took a little over three years for all states to ratify.
The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of Province of Quebec (referred to as "Canada" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so.
It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission.
Article summaries.
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people, the two documents are very different.
Stylistically, the Articles are more wordy, less straightforward and less quotable than the Constitution.
Functionally, they lay out very different forms of government.
The original five-page Articles contained a preamble, 13 articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.
The preamble states that the signatory states "agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union" between the 13 states.
The following list contains short summaries of each of the 13 articles.
While still at war with Britain, the Founding Fathers were divided between those seeking a powerful, centralized national government (the "federalists"), and those seeking a loosely structured one (the "anti federalists").
Jealously guarding their new independence, members of the Continental Congress arrived at a compromise solution dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states.
While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism with which to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or revenue.
At times, this left the military without adequate funding, supplies or even food.
The end of the Revolutionary War.
The Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it.
Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance.
In September 1783,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  complained that Congress was paralyzed.
Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.
Function.
The Army.
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the Continental Army, and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers.
As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian  <START:person> Bruce Chadwick <END>  wrote:  <START:person> George Washington <END>  had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government.
The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress.
... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states.
Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.
The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life.
However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor.
No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783–84.
General  <START:person> Henry Knox <END> , who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army.
The army had long been supportive of a strong union.
 <START:person> Knox <END>  wrote: The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies.
Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign.
... It is a favorite toast in the army, "A hoop to the barrel" or "Cement to the Union".
As Congress failed to act on the petitions,  <START:person> Knox <END>  wrote to  <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END> , four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, "As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution."
Once the war had been won, the Continental Army was largely disbanded.
A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks.
Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies.
The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met.
In 1783,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  defused the Newburgh conspiracy, but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.
The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states.
Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests.
The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs.
 <START:person> Dougherty <END>  (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis.
This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.
Foreign policy.
Even after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy.
In 1789,  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> , concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates, wrote to  <START:person> James Monroe <END> , "It will be said there is no money in the treasury.
There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth.
The states must see the rod.”
Furthermore, the  <START:person> Jay <END> –Gardoqui Treaty with Spain in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy.
In this treaty — which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity — the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains.
Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil — forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation.
This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris (1783) was superseded by the implementation of  <START:person> Jay <END> 's Treaty in 1795 under the new U.S. Constitution.
Taxation and Commerce.
Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited.
The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers.
Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.
Congress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states.
The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money.
As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated.
In 1779,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  wrote to  <START:person> John Jay <END> , who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, "that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions."
Mr.  <START:person> Jay <END>  and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the States.
In an appeal to the States to comply,  <START:person> Jay <END>  wrote that the taxes were "the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity."
He argued that Americans should avoid having it said "that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent" or that "her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith."
The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.
Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies.
The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War.
Some States paid off their war debts and others did not.
Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.
Accomplishments of the Confederation.
Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact.
The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states, the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use.
This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.
The Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River.
Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the township (36 square miles), the section (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 acres).
This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire).
Then, when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims, organized the Northwest Territory and thus cleared the way for the entry of five new states and part of a sixth to the Union.
To be specific, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia gave up all of their claims to land north of the Ohio River and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania.
Over several decades a number of new states were formed from this land: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River.
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery.
New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.
The United States of America under the Articles.
The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure.
The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced.
There was no president and no national court.
Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.
By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity.
However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires.
The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships.
France and Spain established similar policies.
Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again.
Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution.
The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation.
In 1786–87,  <START:person> Shays <END> ' Rebellion, an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.
The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression "not worth a continental".
Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States.
Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.
When  <START:person> John Adams <END>  went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce.
Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty.
 <START:person> Adams <END>  stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain.
Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws.
Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect.
When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.
By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping.
State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit.
Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.
The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor.
 <START:person> Alexander Hamilton <END>  realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress.
 <START:person> Hamilton <END>  led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.
Signatures.
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777.
A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress.
On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of  <START:person> Henry Laurens <END>  and  <START:person> Charles Thomson <END> , who were the President and Secretary to the Congress.
The "Articles", however, were unsigned, and the date was blank.
Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the "Articles" on June 27, 1778.
They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.
On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready.
They dated it, and began to sign.
They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed.
On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified.
New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified.
North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.
After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended.
For example,  <START:person> John Wentworth <END>  of New Hampshire added his name on August 8.
 <START:person> John Penn <END>  was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the "Articles" on July 21, 1778.
The other states had to wait until they ratified the "Articles" and notified their Congressional delegation.
Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779.
Maryland refused to ratify the "Articles" until every state had ceded its western land claims.
On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis.
As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, "among engrossed Bills" was "signed and sealed by Governor  <START:person> Thomas Sim Lee <END>  in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation" and perpetual union among the states.
The Senate then adjourned "to the first Monday in August next."
The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12.
The confirmation signing of the "Articles" by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon.
With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.
Congress had debated the "Articles" for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years.
Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived.
The "Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union" were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.
Signers.
The signers and the states they represented were:  <START:person> Roger Sherman <END>  (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
 <START:person> Robert Morris <END>  (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
 <START:person> John Dickinson <END>  (Delaware),  <START:person> Daniel Carroll <END>  (Maryland) and  <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END>  (New York), along with  <START:person> Sherman <END>  and  <START:person> Robert Morris <END> , were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution ( <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END>  represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).
Presidents of the Congress.
The following list is of those who led the Congress of the Confederation under the "Articles of Confederation" as the Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled.
Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions.
He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor President of the United States is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.
"For a full list of Presidents of the Congress Assembled and Presidents under the two Continental Congresses before the Articles, see President of the Continental Congress."
Revision and replacement.
On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following  <START:person> James Madison <END> 's recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict.
At what came to be known as the Annapolis Convention, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a "Grand Convention."
Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution.
The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed.
The general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships.
Historian  <START:person> Forrest McDonald <END> , using the ideas of  <START:person> James Madison <END>  from "Federalist 39", describes the change this way: The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun.
Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states.
The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.
In May 1786,  <START:person> Charles Pinckney <END>  of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation.
Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries.
Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus.
The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after  <START:person> Shays <END> ' Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.
Historian  <START:person> Ralph Ketcham <END>  comments on the opinions of  <START:person> Patrick Henry <END> ,  <START:person> George Mason <END> , and other antifederalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution: Antifederalists feared what  <START:person> Patrick Henry <END>  termed the "consolidated government" proposed by the new Constitution.
They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a "splendid empire" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns.
Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.
Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787.
 <START:person> Jillson <END>  and  <START:person> Wilson <END>  (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.
 <START:person> Rakove <END>  (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation.
The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power.
It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island.
 <START:person> Rakove <END>  concludes that their failure to implement national measures "stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace."
The second group of factors  <START:person> Rakove <END>  identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy.
Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.
When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new "merchant state," much like the British state people had rebelled against.
In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims.
Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.
Legitimacy of closing down.
Political scientist  <START:person> David C. Hendrickson <END>  writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation,  <START:person> John Jay <END>  of New York and  <START:person> Thomas Burke <END>  of North Carolina believed that "the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges."
According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously:  [T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.
On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity: The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.
The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.
In 1788,  <START:person> James Madison <END>  remarked (in "Federalist No. 40") that the issue had become moot: "As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation."
Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.
At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.
Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.
Modern scholars such as  <START:person> Francisco Forrest Martin <END>  agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus "other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule".
In contrast, law professor  <START:person> Akhil Amar <END>  suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.
Final months.
According to their terms for modification (Article XIII), the Articles would still have been in effect until 1790, the year in which the last of the 13 states, Rhode Island, ratified the new Constitution.
The Congress under the Articles continued to convene with a quorum until October 1788, overseeing the adoption of the new Constitution by the states, setting elections and attending to other business.
By July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.
On Saturday, September 13, 1788, the Confederation Congress voted the resolve to implement the new Constitution, and on Monday, September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.
On that same September 13, it determined that New York would remain the national capital.

Aikido  Aikido (Japanese: 合気道,  <START:person> Hepburn <END> : Aikidō) ] is a Japanese martial art developed by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and religious beliefs.
Aikido is often translated as "the way of unifying (with) life energy" or as "the way of harmonious spirit."
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury.
Aikido techniques consist of entering and turning movements that redirect the momentum of an opponent's attack, and a throw or joint lock that terminates the technique.
Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's involvement with the Ōmoto-kyō religion.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's early students' documents bear the term "aiki-jūjutsu".
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him.
Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis.
However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.
Etymology and basic philosophy.
The word "aikido" is formed of three kanji: The term "aiki" does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of  <START:person> Budo <END> .
This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.
合 is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being 合同 (combined/united), 合成 (composition), 結合 (unite/combine/join together), 連合 (union/alliance/association), 統合 (combine/unify), and 合意 (mutual agreement).
There is an idea of reciprocity, 知り合う (to get to know one another), 話し合い (talk/discussion/negotiation), and 待ち合わせる (meet by appointment).
気 is often used to describe a feeling, as in なになに気がする ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and 気持ち (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in 電気 (electricity) and 磁気 (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in 気質 (spirit/trait/temperament).
The term dō is also found in martial arts such as judo and kendo, and in various non-martial arts, such as Japanese calligraphy (shodō), flower arranging (kadō) and tea ceremony (chadō or sadō).
Therefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the "Way of combining forces", in that the term aiki refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.
One applies aiki by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.
History.
Aikido was created by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  (植芝 盛平 "Ueshiba Morihei", 14 December 1883 – 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as "Ōsensei" ("Great Teacher").
The term 'aikido' was coined in the twentieth century.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation.
During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the Aiki that  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.
Initial development.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.
The core martial art from which aikido derives is Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu, which  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  studied directly with  <START:person> Takeda Sōkaku <END> , the reviver of that art.
Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied  <START:person> Tenjin Shin <END> 'yō-ryū with  <START:person> Tozawa Tokusaburō <END>  in Tokyo in 1901, Gotōha Yagyū Shingan-ryū under  <START:person> Nakai Masakatsu <END>  in Sakai from 1903 to 1908, and judo with  <START:person> Kiyoichi Takagi <END>  (高木 喜代子 "Takagi Kiyoichi", 1894–1972) in Tanabe in 1911.
The art of Daitō-ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido.
Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the spear ("yari"), short staff ("jō"), and perhaps the bayonet (銃剣, jūken).
However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ("kenjutsu").
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  moved to Hokkaidō in 1912, and began studying under  <START:person> Takeda Sokaku <END>  in 1915.
His official association with Daitō-ryū continued until 1937.
However, during the latter part of that period,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  had already begun to distance himself from  <START:person> Takeda <END>  and the Daitō-ryū.
At that time  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  was referring to his martial art as "Aiki Budō".
It is unclear exactly when  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  began using the name "aikido", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ("Dai Nippon Butoku Kai") was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.
Religious influences.
After  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  left  <START:person> Hokkaidō <END>  in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by  <START:person> Onisaburo Deguchi <END> , the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in  <START:person> Ayabe <END> .
One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life.
This was a great influence on  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others.
Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it.
In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.
In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with  <START:person> Deguchi <END>  gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.
As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students.
Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.
International dissemination.
Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by  <START:person> Minoru Mochizuki <END>  with a visit to France where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students.
He was followed by  <START:person> Tadashi Abe <END>  in 1952 who came as the official Aikikai Hombu representative, remaining in France for seven years.
 <START:person> Kenji Tomiki <END>  toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953.
Later in that year,  <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END>  was sent by  <START:person> Aikikai Hombu <END>  to Hawaii, for a full year, where he set up several dojo.
This was followed up by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States.
The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by  <START:person> Hiroshi Tada <END> ; and Germany 1965 by  <START:person> Katsuaki Asai <END> .
Designated "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa" by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> ,  <START:person> Masamichi Noro <END>  arrived in France in September 1961.
 <START:person> Seiichi Sugano <END>  was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965.
Today there are aikido dojo available throughout the world.
Proliferation of independent organizations.
The largest aikido organization is the Aikikai Foundation, which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family.
However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> 's major students.
The earliest independent styles to emerge were Yoseikan Aikido, begun by  <START:person> Minoru Mochizuki <END>  in 1931, Yoshinkan Aikido founded by  <START:person> Gozo Shioda <END>  in 1955, and Shodokan Aikido, founded by  <START:person> Kenji Tomiki <END>  in 1967.
The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized.
Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.
After  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged.
Significant controversy arose with the departure of the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief instructor  <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END> , in 1974.
 <START:person> Tohei <END>  left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder,  <START:person> Kisshomaru Ueshiba <END> , who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation.
The disagreement was over the proper role of "ki" development in regular aikido training.
After  <START:person> Tohei <END>  left, he formed his own style, called  <START:person> Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido <END> , and the organization which governs it, the Ki Society ("Ki no Kenkyūkai").
A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in Iwama, Ibaraki, and the teaching methodology of long term student  <START:person> Morihiro Saito <END> .
It is unofficially referred to as the "Iwama style", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called  <START:person> Iwama Ryu <END> .
Although  <START:person> Iwama <END>  style practitioners remained part of the  <START:person> Aikikai <END>  until  <START:person> Saito <END> 's death in 2002, followers of  <START:person> Saito <END>  subsequently split into two groups; one remaining with the  <START:person> Aikikai <END>  and the other forming the independent Shinshin Aikishuren Kai in 2004 around  <START:person> Saito <END> 's son  <START:person> Hitohiro Saito <END> .
Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own headquarters (本部道場, honbu dōjō) in Japan, and have an international breadth.
Ki.
The study of "ki" is a critical component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses both.
The original "kanji" for "ki" was 氣, and is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice; the "nourishing vapors" contained within are "ki".
The character for "ki" is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as "health" (元気, genki), or "shyness" (内気, uchiki).
"Ki" is most often understood as unified physical and mental intention, however in traditional martial arts it is often discussed as "life energy".
 <START:person> Gōzō Shioda <END> 's Yoshinkan Aikido, considered one of the "hard styles," largely follows  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to "ki" lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.
In later years,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's application of "ki" in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel.
This was his  <START:person> Takemusu Aiki <END>  and many of his later students teach about "ki" from this perspective.
 <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END> 's Ki Society centers almost exclusively around the study of the empirical (albeit subjective) experience of "ki" with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and "ki" development.
Training.
In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training.
The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques.
Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll.
The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins.
After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.
Fitness.
Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training.
In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements.
This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.
In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power.
Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates.
For example, many dojos begin each class with warm-up exercises (準備体操, "junbi taisō"), which may include stretching and ukemi (break falls).
Roles of "uke" and "tori".
Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms ("kata") rather than freestyle practice.
The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique ("uke") to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the 取り "tori", or "shite" 仕手 (depending on aikido style), also referred to as 投げ "nage" (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.
Both halves of the technique, that of "uke" and that of "nage", are considered essential to aikido training.
Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation.
"Nage" learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while "uke" learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which "nage" places them.
This "receiving" of the technique is called "ukemi".
"Uke" continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while "nage" uses position and timing to keep "uke" off-balance and vulnerable.
In more advanced training, "uke" will sometimes apply reversal techniques (返し技, kaeshi-waza) to regain balance and pin or throw "nage".
"Ukemi" (受身) refers to the act of receiving a technique.
Good "ukemi" involves attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment—it is an active rather than a passive receiving of aikido.
The fall itself is part of aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, what would otherwise be a devastating strike or throw.
Initial attacks.
Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner.
Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.
Many of the strikes (打ち, uchi) of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for armed combat.
Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches ("tsuki"), are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword.
Kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.
Some basic strikes include: Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike.
Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.
The following are examples of some basic grabs: Basic techniques.
The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins.
Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> .
The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation.
Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.
Implementations.
Aikido makes use of body movement ("tai sabaki") to blend with "uke".
For example, an "entering" ("irimi") technique consists of movements inward towards "uke", while a "turning" (転換, tenkan) technique uses a pivoting motion.
Additionally, an "inside" (内, uchi) technique takes place in front of "uke", whereas an "outside" (外, soto) technique takes place to his side; a "front" (表, omote) technique is applied with motion to the front of "uke", and a "rear" (裏, ura) version is applied with motion towards the rear of "uke", usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion.
Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture ("seiza").
Techniques where both "uke" and "nage" are standing are called "tachi-waza", techniques where both start off in "seiza" are called "suwari-waza", and techniques performed with "uke" standing and "nage" sitting are called "hanmi handachi".
Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations.
For instance, "ikkyō" can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an "ura" type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an "omote-waza" version).
Specific aikido "kata" are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)".
For instance, "katate-dori ikkyō" refers to any "ikkyō" technique executed when "uke" is holding one wrist.
This could be further specified as "katate-dori ikkyō omote", referring to any forward-moving "ikkyō" technique from that grab.
"Atemi" (当て身) are strikes (or feints) employed during an aikido technique.
Some view "atemi" as attacks against "vital points" meant to cause damage in and of themselves.
For instance,  <START:person> Gōzō Shioda <END>  described using "atemi" in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.
Others consider "atemi", especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques.
A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration.
The target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.
Many sayings about "atemi" are attributed to  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> , who considered them an essential element of technique.
Weapons.
Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff ("jō"), wooden sword ("bokken"), and knife ("tantō").
Some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques.
Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught.
Some schools, such as the  <START:person> Iwama <END>  style of  <START:person> Morihiro Saito <END> , usually spend substantial time with "bokken" and "jō", practised under the names "aiki-ken", and "aiki-jō", respectively.
The founder developed much of empty-handed aikido from traditional sword and spear movements.
Consequently, the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).
Multiple attackers and "randori".
One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called "taninzudori", or "taninzugake".
Freestyle ("randori", or "jiyūwaza") practice with multiple attackers is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks.
"Randori", literally "chaos", exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.
Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in "randori" training.
For instance, an "ura" technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.
In Shodokan Aikido, "randori" differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will.
In this respect it resembles judo "randori".
Injuries.
In applying a technique during training, it is the responsibility of "nage" to prevent injury to "uke" by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in "ukemi".
Injuries (especially those to the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of "nage" misjudging the ability of "uke" to receive the throw or pin.
A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other.
Soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido, as well as joint strain and stubbed fingers and toes.
Several deaths from aggressive "shihōnage", resulting from head and neck injury, in a Japanese-style hazing context have been reported.
Mental training.
Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.
This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness.
 <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute techniques without hesitation.
As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.
Uniforms and ranking.
Aikido practitioners (commonly called "aikidōka" outside of Japan) generally progress by promotion through a series of "grades" ("kyū"), followed by a series of "degrees" ("dan"), pursuant to formal testing procedures.
Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and black belts to distinguish lower and higher grades, though some use various belt colors.
Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.
Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a "dan" rank unless they are 16 or older.
The uniform worn for practicing aikido ("aikidōgi") is similar to the training uniform ("keikogi") used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.
Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used.
Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.
Most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called a "hakama" (used also in kendo and iaido.)
In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with ("dan") ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a "hakama" regardless of rank.
Criticisms.
The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training.
The attacks initiated by "uke" (and which "nage" must defend against) have been criticized as being "weak," "sloppy," and "little more than caricatures of an attack."
Weak attacks from "uke" allow for a conditioned response from "nage", and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.
To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners.
Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format.
Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.
Another criticism pertains to the shift toward ki as the focus of training.
After the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in  <START:person> Iwama <END>  from 1942 to the mid-1950s, he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido.
As a result, strikes to vital points by "nage", entering ("irimi") and initiation of techniques by "nage", the distinction between "omote" (front side) and "ura" (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.
Lack of training in these areas is thought to lead to an overall loss of effectiveness by some aikido practitioners.
Conversely, some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> .
The premise of this criticism is that "O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts."
That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional "jujutsu" or "kenjutsu" are diverging from what  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  taught.
Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that "[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals ["sic"] of the paradigm that he demonstrated."
Aquarius (constellation)  Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces.
Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its symbol is (Unicode ♒), a representation of water.
Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the sun's apparent path).
It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer  <START:person> Ptolemy <END> , and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.
It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish, and Eridanus the river.
History and mythology.
Aquarius is identified as GU.LA "The Great One" in the Babylonian star catalogues and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase.
The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium.
It contained the winter solstice in the Early Bronze Age.
In Old Babylonian astronomy,  <START:person> Ea <END>  was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun's path, the "Way of Ea", corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice.
Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negatively connoted.
In Ancient Egypt, Aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the Nile; the banks were said to flood when  <START:person> Aquarius <END>  put his jar into the river, beginning spring.
In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to  <START:person> Piscis Austrinus <END> .
The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise "kumbha" "water-pitcher", showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek intermediaries.
In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with  <START:person> Troy <END> .
The myth has is that a young boy named Ganymede was out tending to his fathers sheep when  <START:person> Zeus <END>  took interest in this young beautiful boy.
 <START:person> Zeus <END>  then turned himself into an eagle and carried Ganymede to Mount Ide where Ganymede would have to serve drinks to Zeus.
But one day, Ganymede didn't want to serve drinks anymore, so he poured out Zeus wine and water which caused a great flood.
It was then said instead of Zeus getting mad he gave Ganymede immortality and gave him the constellation Aquarius.
In non-Western astronomy.
In Chinese astronomy, the stream of water flowing from the Water Jar was depicted as the "Army of Yu-Lin" ("Yu-lin-kiun" or "Yulinjun").
The name "Yu-lin" means "feathers and forests", referring to the numerous light-footed soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars.
The constellation's stars were the most numerous of any Chinese constellation, numbering 45, the majority of which were located in modern Aquarius.
The celestial army was protected by the wall "Leibizhen", which counted Iota, Lambda, Phi, and Sigma Aquarii among its 12 stars.
88, 89, and 98 Aquarii represent "Fou-youe", the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions.
Also in Aquarius is "Loui-pi-tchin", the ramparts that stretch from 29 and 27 Piscium and 33 and 30 Aquarii through Phi, Lambda, Sigma, and  <START:person> Iota Aquarii <END>  to Delta, Gamma, Kappa, and  <START:person> Epsilon Capricorni <END> .
Near the border with Cetus, the axe "Fuyue" was represented by three stars; its position is disputed and may have instead been located in Sculptor.
"Tienliecheng" also has a disputed position; the 13-star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed Nu and Xi Aquarii but may instead have been located south in Piscis Austrinus.
The Water Jar asterism was seen to the ancient Chinese as the tomb, "Fenmu".
Nearby, the emperors' mausoleum "Xiuliang" stood, demarcated by  <START:person> Kappa Aquarii <END>  and three other collinear stars.
"Ku" ("crying") and "Qi" ("weeping"), each composed of two stars, were located in the same region.
Three of the Chinese lunar mansions shared their name with constellations.
"Nu", also the name for the 10th lunar mansion, was a handmaiden represented by Epsilon, Mu, 3, and 4 Aquarii.
The 11th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation "Xu" ("emptiness"), formed by Beta Aquarii and Alpha Equulei; it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals.
"Wei", the rooftop and 12th lunar mansion, was a V-shaped constellation formed by Alpha Aquarii, Theta Pegasi, and Epsilon Pegasi; it shared its name with two other Chinese constellations, in modern-day Scorpius and Aries.
Depictions.
In the first century CE,  <START:person> Ptolemy <END> 's "Almagest" established the common Western depiction of Aquarius.
His water jar, an asterism itself, consists of Gamma, Pi, Eta, and Zeta Aquarii; it pours water in a stream of more than 20 stars terminating with Fomalhaut, now assigned solely to  <START:person> Piscis Austrinus <END> .
The water bearer's head is represented by 5th magnitude 25 Aquarii while his left shoulder is Beta Aquarii; his right shoulder and forearm are represented by Alpha and  <START:person> Gamma Aquarii <END>  respectively.
Notable features.
Stars.
Despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size, Aquarius has no particularly bright stars, with its 4 brightest stars less than magnitude 2. However, recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems.
α Aquarii, also known as  <START:person> Sadalmelik <END> , is a G2 spectral class star (yellow supergiant) named in Arabic for the phrase "the lucky stars of the king".
It is the second brightest star in Aquarius with a magnitude of 2.96 (though it has an absolute magnitude of -4.5) and is 523 light-years from Earth.
It has a luminosity of 5250 L☉.
β Aquarii, sometimes called Sadalsuud, is a G0 spectral class star (yellow supergiant) named for the Arabic phrase meaning "luckiest of the lucky stars".
It is the brightest star in Aquarius with an apparent magnitude of 2.91 and an absolute magnitude of -4.5.
Sadalsuud is 537 light-years from Earth and has a luminosity of 5250 L☉, the same as α Aquarii.
γ Aquarii, also called Sadachbia, is a blue-white A0 spectral class star of magnitude 3.84 and a luminosity of 50 L☉ that is 163 light years away.
It has a luminosity of 50 L☉.
The name  <START:person> Sadachbia <END>  comes from the Arabic for "lucky stars of the tents", "sa'd al-akhbiya".
δ Aquarii, also known as  <START:person> Scheat <END>  or Skat, is a blue-white A2 spectral class star of magnitude 3.27 and luminosity of 105 L☉.
ε Aquarii, also known as Albali, is a blue-white A1 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 3.77, an absolute magnitude of 1.2, and a luminosity of 28 L☉.
ζ Aquarii is an F2 spectral class double star; both stars are white.
Overall, it appears to be of magnitude 3.6 and luminosity of 50 L☉.
The primary has a magnitude of 4.53 and the secondary a magnitude of 4.31, but both have an absolute magnitude of 0.6.
Its orbital period is 760 years; the two components are currently moving farther apart.
θ Aquarii, sometimes called Ancha, is a G8 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.16 and an absolute magnitude of 1.4.
λ Aquarii, also called Hudoor or Ekchusis, is an M2 spectral class star of magnitude 3.74 and luminosity of 120 L☉.
ξ Aquarii, also called  <START:person> Bunda <END> , is an A7 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.69 and an absolute magnitude of 2.4.
π Aquarii, also called Seat, is a B0 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.66 and an absolute magnitude of -4.1.
Planetary systems.
Twelve exoplanet systems have been found in Aquarius as of 2013.
Gliese 876, one of the nearest stars to Earth at a distance of 15 light-years, was the first red dwarf star to be found to possess a planetary system.
It is orbited by four planets, including one terrestrial planet 6.6 times the mass of Earth.
The planets vary in orbital period from 2 days to 124 days.
91 Aquarii is an orange giant star orbited by one planet, 91 Aquarii b.
The planet's mass is 2.9 times the mass of Jupiter, and its orbital period is 182 days.
Gliese 849 is a red dwarf star orbited by the first known long-period Jupiter-like planet, Gliese 849 b.
The planet's mass is 0.99 times that of Jupiter and its orbital period is 1,852 days.
There are also less-prominent systems in Aquarius.
WASP-6, a type G8 star of magnitude 12.4, is host to one exoplanet, WASP-6 b.
The star is 307 parsecs from Earth and has a mass of 0.888 solar masses and a radius of 0.87 solar radii.
WASP-6 b was discovered in 2008 by the transit method.
It orbits its parent star every 3.36 days at a distance of 0.042 astronomical units (AU).
It is 0.503 Jupiter masses but has a proportionally larger radius of 1.224 Jupiter radii.
HD 206610, a K0 star located 194 parsecs from Earth, is host to one planet, HD 206610 b.
The host star is larger than the Sun; more massive at 1.56 solar masses and larger at 6.1 solar radii.
The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method n 2010 and has a mass of 2.2 Jupiter masses.
It orbits every 610 days at a distance of 1.68 AU.
Much closer to its sun is WASP-47 b, which orbits every 4.15 days only 0.052 AU from its sun, yellow dwarf (G9V) WASP-47.
WASP-47 is close in size to the Sun, having a radius of 1.15 solar radii and a mass even closer at 1.08 solar masses.
WASP-47 b was discovered in 2011 by the transit method, like WASP-6 b.
It is slightly larger than Jupiter with a mass of 1.14 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.15 Jupiter masses.
There are several more single-planet systems in Aquarius.
HD 210277, a magnitude 6.63 yellow star located 21.29 parsecs from Earth, is host to one known planet: HD 210277 b.
The 1.23 Jupiter mass planet orbits at nearly the same distance as Earth orbits the Sun 1.1 AU, though its orbital period is significantly longer at around 442 days.
HD 210277 b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in Aquarius, detected by the radial velocity method in 1998.
The star it orbits resembles the Sun beyond their similar spectral class; it has a radius of 1.1 solar radii and a mass of 1.09 solar masses.
HD 212771 b, a larger planet at 2.3 Jupiter masses, orbits host star HD 212771 at a distance of 1.22 AU.
The star itself, barely below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.6, is a G8IV (yellow subgiant) star located 131 parsecs from Earth.
Though it has a similar mass to the Sun 1.15 solar masses it is significantly less dense with its radius of 5 solar radii.
Its lone planet was discovered in 2010 by the radial velocity method, like several other exoplanets in the constellation.
As of 2013, there are only two multiple-planet systems within the bounds of Aquarius: the Gliese 876 and HD 215152 systems.
The former is quite prominent; the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at 21.5 parsecs.
The HD 215152 system consists of the planets HD 215152 b and HD 215152 c orbiting their K0-type, magnitude 8.13 sun.
Both discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method, the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star.
HD 215152 c is the larger at 0.0097 Jupiter masses (still significantly larger than the Earth, which weighs in at 0.00315 Jupiter masses); its smaller sibling is barely smaller at 0.0087 Jupiter masses.
The error in the mass measurements (0.0032 and 0.0049 MJ respectively) is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant.
HD 215152 c also orbits further from the star than HD 215152 b, 0.0852 AU compared to 0.0652.
Deep sky objects.
Because of its position away from the galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae.
Aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the  <START:person> Messier <END>  catalog: the globular clusters Messier 2,  <START:person> Messier <END>  72, and the open cluster  <START:person> Messier <END>  73.
Two well-known planetary nebulae are also located in Aquarius: the Saturn Nebula (NGC 7009), to the eastwest of μ Aquarii; and the famous Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), southwest of δ Aquarii.
M2, also catalogued as NGC 7089, is an incredibly rich globular cluster located approximately 37,000 light-years from Earth.
At magnitude 6.5, it is viewable in small-aperture instruments, but a 100 mm aperture telescope is needed to resolve any stars.
M72, also catalogued as NGC 6981, is a small 9th magnitude globular cluster located approximately 56,000 light-years from Earth.
M73, also catalogued as NGC 6994, is an open cluster with highly disputed status.
Aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae.
NGC 7009, also known as the Saturn Nebula, is an 8th magnitude planetary nebula located 3,000 light-years from Earth.
It was given its moniker by the 19th century astronomer Lord  <START:person> Rosse <END>  for its resemblance to the planet Saturn in a telescope; it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble Saturn's rings.
It appears blue-green in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude 11.3.
Compared to the Helix Nebula, another planetary nebula in Aquarius, it is quite small.
NGC 7293, also known as the Helix Nebula, is the closest planetary nebula to Earth at a distance of 650 light-years.
It covers 0.25 square degrees, making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from Earth.
However, because it is so large, it is only viewable as a very faint object, though it has a fairly high integrated magnitude of 6.0.
One of the visible galaxies in Aquarius is NGC 7727, of particular interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe supernovae.
A spiral galaxy (type S), it has an integrated magnitude of 10.7 and is 3 by 3 arcseconds.
NGC 7252 is a tangle of stars resulting from the collision of two large galaxies and is known as the Atoms-for-Peace galaxy because of its resemblance to a cartoon atom.
Meteor showers.
There are three major meteor showers with radiants in Aquarius: the Eta Aquariids, the Delta Aquariids, and the Iota Aquariids.
The Eta Aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from Aquarius.
It peaks between 5 and 6 May with a rate of approximately 35 meteors per hour.
Originally discovered by Chinese astronomers in 401 CE, Eta Aquariids can be seen coming from the Water Jar beginning on April 21 and as late as May 12.
The parent body of the shower is  <START:person> Halley <END> 's Comet, a periodic comet.
Fireballs are common shortly after the peak, approximately between May 9 and May 11.
The normal meteors appear to have yellow trails.
The Delta Aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 July and second on 6 August.
The first radiant is located in the south of the constellation, while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of Pisces asterism.
The southern radiant's peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour, while the northern radiant's peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour.
The Iota Aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on 6 August, with a rate of approximately 8 meteors per hour.
Astrology.
s of 2002[ [update]], the Sun appears in the constellation Aquarius from 16 February to 11 March.
In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Aquarius from 20 January to 19 February, and in sidereal astrology, from 15 February to 14 March.
Aquarius is also associated with the Age of Aquarius, a concept popular in 1960s counterculture.
Despite this prominence, the Age of Aquarius will not dawn until the year 2597, as an astrological age does not begin until the Sun is in a particular constellation on the vernal equinox.

Coordinates:    <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell  Alexander Graham Bell <END>  (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was an eminent Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer and innovator who is credited with inventing the first practical telephone.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing  <START:person> Bell <END> 's life's work.
His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.
Many other inventions marked  <START:person> Bell <END> 's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils and aeronautics.
In 1888,  <START:person> Bell <END>  became one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society.
Early life.
 <START:person> Alexander Bell <END>  was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3, 1847.
The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END> 's birthplace.
He had two brothers:  <START:person> Melville James Bell <END>  (1845–70) and  <START:person> Edward Charles Bell <END>  (1848–67).
Both of his brothers died of tuberculosis.
His father was Professor  <START:person> Alexander Melville Bell <END> , and his mother was  <START:person> Eliza Grace <END>  (née Symonds).
Although he was born "Alexander", at age 10, he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers.
For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the middle name " <START:person> Graham <END> ", chosen out of admiration for  <START:person> Alexander Graham <END> , a Canadian being treated by his father and boarder who had become a family friend.
To close relatives and friends he remained "Aleck" which his father continued to call him into later life.
First invention.
As a child, young  <START:person> Bell <END>  displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age.
His best friend was  <START:person> Ben Herdman <END> , a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays.
 <START:person> Young Bell <END>  asked what needed to be done at the mill.
He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.
In return,  <START:person> John Herdman <END>  gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to "invent".
From his early years,  <START:person> Bell <END>  showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother.
With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist.
Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.
He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study acoustics.
His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END> , in London, his uncle in Dublin, and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists.
His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his "The Standard Elocutionist" (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868.
"The Standard Elocutionist" appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone.
In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities.
He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic, and even Sanskrit, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.
Education.
As a young child,  <START:person> Bell <END> , like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father.
At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms.
His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades.
His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father.
Upon leaving school,  <START:person> Bell <END>  travelled to London to live with his grandfather,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END> .
During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study.
The elder  <START:person> Bell <END>  took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself.
At age 16, Bell secured a position as a "pupil-teacher" of elocution and music, in Weston House Academy, at Elgin, Moray, Scotland.
Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session.
The following year, he attended the University of Edinburgh; joining his older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  who had enrolled there the previous year.
In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family,  <START:person> Bell <END>  completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the University of London.
First experiments with sound.
His father encouraged  <START:person> Bell <END> ’s interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique automaton, developed by Sir  <START:person> Charles Wheatstone <END>  based on the earlier work of  <START:person> Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen <END> .
The rudimentary "mechanical man" simulated a human voice.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of  <START:person> von Kempelen <END> 's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  built their own automaton head.
Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful.
While his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull.
His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could "speak", albeit only a few words.
The boys would carefully adjust the "lips" and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe, a very recognizable "Mama" ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.
Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye Terrier, "Trouve".
After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding "Ow ah oo ga ma ma".
With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate "How are you grandma?"
More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a "talking dog".
However, these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using tuning forks to explore resonance.
At the age of 19, he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist  <START:person> Alexander Ellis <END> , a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor  <START:person> Henry Higgins <END>  in "Pygmalion").
 <START:person> Ellis <END>  immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of  <START:person> Hermann von Helmholtz <END> 's work, "The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music".
Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by  <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork "contraption", he pored over the German scientist's book.
Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: "Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech."
He also later remarked: "I thought that  <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity.
It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!"
Family tragedy.
In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London,  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment.
Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.
Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion.
His younger brother,  <START:person> Edward "Ted <END> ," was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from tuberculosis.
While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as "A.G.
Bell") and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, Bath, England, his brother's condition deteriorated.
 <START:person> Edward <END>  would never recover.
Upon his brother's death,  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned home in 1867.
His older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  had married and moved out.
With aspirations to obtain a degree at the University College London,  <START:person> Bell <END>  considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.
Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to  <START:person> Susanna E. Hull <END> 's private school for the deaf in South Kensington, London.
His first two pupils were "deaf mute" girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage.
While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family,  <START:person> Bell <END>  continued as a teacher.
However, in May 1870,  <START:person> Melville <END>  died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis.
His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in Newfoundland.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly.
Acting decisively,  <START:person> Alexander Melville Bell <END>  asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property, conclude all of his brother's affairs ( <START:person> Bell <END>  took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp), and join his father and mother in setting out for the "New World".
Reluctantly,  <START:person> Bell <END>  also had to conclude a relationship with  <START:person> Marie Eccleston <END> , who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.
Canada.
In 1870, at age 23,  <START:person> Bell <END> , his brother's widow,  <START:person> Caroline <END>  ( <START:person> Margaret Ottaway <END> ), and his parents travelled on the SS "Nestorian" to Canada.
After landing at Quebec City the Bells transferred to another steamer to Montreal and then boarded a train to Paris, Ontario, to stay with the Reverend  <START:person> Thomas Henderson <END> , a family friend.
After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the  <START:person> Bell <END>  family purchased a farm of 10.5 acre at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near Brantford, Ontario.
The property consisted of an orchard, large farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house, and a carriage house, which bordered the Grand River.
At the homestead,  <START:person> Bell <END>  set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his "dreaming place", a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river.
Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly improved.
He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga, he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols.
For his work,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances.
After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on  <START:person> Helmholtz <END> 's work with electricity and sound.
He also modified a melodeon (a type of pump organ) so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance.
Once the family was settled in, both  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where  <START:person> Melville <END>  was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.
Work with the deaf.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father was invited by  <START:person> Sarah Fuller <END> , principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public  <START:person> Horace Mann <END>  School for the Deaf), in Boston, Massachusetts, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for  <START:person> Fuller <END> 's instructors, but he declined the post in favor of his son.
Traveling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors.
He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the American Asylum for Deaf-mutes in Hartford, Connecticut, and the  <START:person> Clarke <END>  School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts.
Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his "harmonic telegraph".
The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.
Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher.
His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting  <START:person> Gardiner Greene Hubbard <END> , the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation.
Teaching his father's system, in October 1872,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END>  opened his "School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech" in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils, with his first class numbering 30 students.
While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was  <START:person> Helen Keller <END> , who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak.
She was later to say that  <START:person> Bell <END>  dedicated his life to the penetration of that "inhuman silence which separates and estranges."
In 1893,  <START:person> Keller <END>  performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of the new Bell's new Volta Bureau, dedicated to "the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf".
Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded.
In several schools, children were mistreated, for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing—the only language they knew—in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication.
Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing deaf culture.
Continuing experimentation.
In the following year,  <START:person> Bell <END>  became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory.
During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home.
At Boston University,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was "swept up" by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city.
He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation.
While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house.
Keeping "night owl" hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment.
Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover.
Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches.
Returning to Boston in fall 1873,  <START:person> Bell <END>  made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.
Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell retained only two students, six-year-old " <START:person> Georgie" Sanders <END> , deaf from birth, and 15-year-old  <START:person> Mabel Hubbard <END> .
Each pupil would play an important role in the next developments.
 <START:person> George <END> 's father,  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END> , a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby Salem with  <START:person> Georgie <END> 's grandmother, complete with a room to "experiment".
Although the offer was made by  <START:person> George <END> 's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr.  <START:person> Sanders <END>  was backing the proposal.
The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in.
 <START:person> Mabel <END>  was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years  <START:person> Bell <END> 's junior, but became the object of his affection.
Having lost her hearing after a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday, she had learned to read lips but her father,  <START:person> Gardiner Greene Hubbard <END> , Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.
Telephone.
By 1874,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston "laboratory" (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success.
While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a "phonautograph", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations.
Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound.
But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.
In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of Western Union President  <START:person> William Orton <END> , had become "the nervous system of commerce".
 <START:person> Orton <END>  had contracted with inventors  <START:person> Thomas Edison <END>  and  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines.
When  <START:person> Bell <END>  mentioned to  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END>  that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments.
Patent matters would be handled by  <START:person> Hubbard <END> 's patent attorney,  <START:person> Anthony Pollok <END> .
In March 1875, Bell and  <START:person> Pollok <END>  visited the famous scientist  <START:person> Joseph Henry <END> , who was then director of the Smithsonian Institution, and asked  <START:person> Henry <END> 's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph.
 <START:person> Henry <END>  replied that Bell had "the germ of a great invention".
When  <START:person> Bell <END>  said that he did not have the necessary knowledge,  <START:person> Henry <END>  replied, "Get it!"
That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas.
However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and  <START:person> Thomas A. Watson <END> , an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of  <START:person> Charles Williams <END> , changed all that.
With financial support from  <START:person> Sanders <END>  and  <START:person> Hubbard <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  hired  <START:person> Thomas Watson <END>  as his assistant, and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy.
On June 2, 1875,  <START:person> Watson <END>  accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech.
That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds.
This led to the "gallows" sound-powered telephone, which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.
The race to the patent office.
In 1875, Bell developed an acoustic telegraph and drew up a patent application for it.
Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  requested that an associate in Ontario,  <START:person> George Brown <END> , attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).
Meanwhile,  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter.
On February 14, 1876,  <START:person> Gray <END>  filed a caveat with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter.
That same morning,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's lawyer filed  <START:person> Bell <END> 's application with the patent office.
There is considerable debate about who arrived first and  <START:person> Gray <END>  later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the U.S. Patent Office.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent covered "the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound"  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in  <START:person> Gray <END> 's patent caveat.
On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued,  <START:person> Bell <END>  succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to  <START:person> Gray <END> 's design.
Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the electrical resistance in the circuit.
When Bell spoke the famous sentence "Mr.
 <START:person> Watson <END> —Come here—I want to see you" into the liquid transmitter,  <START:person> Watson <END> , listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.
Although  <START:person> Bell <END>  was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray, Bell used  <START:person> Gray <END> 's water transmitter design only after  <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent had been granted, and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment, to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.
After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used  <START:person> Gray <END> 's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.
The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved  <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent application.
He told  <START:person> Bell <END>  that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in  <START:person> Gray <END> 's caveat.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which  <START:person> Bell <END>  described a cup of mercury, not water.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  described the water device.
In addition,  <START:person> Gray <END>  abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest  <START:person> Bell <END> 's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876.
 <START:person> Gray <END>  had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but  <START:person> Bell <END>  was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.
The patent examiner,  <START:person> Zenas Fisk Wilber <END> , later stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer,  <START:person> Marcellus Bailey <END> , with whom he had served in the Civil War.
He claimed he showed  <START:person> Gray <END> 's patent caveat to  <START:person> Bailey <END> .
 <START:person> Wilber <END>  also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed  <START:person> Gray <END> 's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100.
Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to  <START:person> Gray <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  admitted that he learned some of the technical details.
Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave  <START:person> Wilber <END>  any money.
Later developments.
Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone.
On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles (eight km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready.
With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying.
The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel.
This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing.
These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  and his partners,  <START:person> Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Sanders <END> , offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000.
The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy.
Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25 million he would consider it a bargain.
By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent.
Bell's investors would become millionaires, while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.
Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public.
A short time later, his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia brought the telephone to international attention.
Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor  <START:person> Pedro II <END>  of Brazil.
Later Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to Sir  <START:person> William Thomson <END>  (later, Lord  <START:person> Kelvin <END> ), a renowned Scottish scientist, as well as to  <START:person> Queen Victoria <END> , who had requested a private audience at Osborne House, her Isle of  <START:person> Wight <END>  home.
She called the demonstration "most extraordinary".
The enthusiasm surrounding  <START:person> Bell <END> 's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.
The Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones.
Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever.
In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union.
This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.
In January 1915,  <START:person> Bell <END>  made the first ceremonial transcontinental telephone call.
Calling from the AT&T head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was heard by  <START:person> Thomas Watson <END>  at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco.
The "New York Times" reported: On October 9, 1876,  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas A. Watson <END>  talked by telephone to each other over a two-mile wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston.
It was the first wire conversation ever held.
Yesterday afternoon [on January 25, 1915] the same two men talked by telephone to each other over a 3,400-mile wire between New York and San Francisco.
Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END> , the veteran inventor of the telephone, was in New York, and Mr.  <START:person> Watson <END> , his former associate, was on the other side of the continent.
They heard each other much more distinctly than they did in their first talk thirty-eight years ago.
Competitors.
As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone.
Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments.
The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  and  <START:person> Amos Dolbear <END> .
In personal correspondence to Bell, both  <START:person> Gray <END>  and  <START:person> Dolbear <END>  had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.
On January 13, 1887, the U,S.
Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation.
After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided.
By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents (No. 174,465 dated March 7, 1876 and No. 186,787 dated January 30, 1877) were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case's importance as a "precedent".
With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the US Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on November 30, 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits.
During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Italian inventor  <START:person> Antonio Meucci <END>  also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834.
In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved,  <START:person> Meucci <END>  took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority.
 <START:person> Meucci <END> 's evidence in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York, which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in 1901.
 <START:person> Meucci <END> 's work, like many other inventors of the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving  <START:person> Meucci <END>  was eventually dropped upon  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's death.
However, due to the efforts of Congressman  <START:person> Vito Fossella <END> , the U.S. House of Representatives on June 11, 2002 stated that  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's "work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged", even though this did not put an end to a still contentious issue.
Some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that Bell's work on the telephone was influenced by  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's inventions.
The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world, and patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell had delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of Siemens & Halske (S&H) managed to set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent.
The Siemens company produced near-identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties.
The establishment of the International Bell Telephone Company in Brussels, Belgium in 1880, as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation.
The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court, necessitated by the legal battles, eventually resulted in his resignation from the company.
Family life.
On July 11, 1877, a few days after the Bell Telephone Company was established, Bell married  <START:person> Mabel Hubbard <END>  (1857–1923) at the  <START:person> Hubbard <END>  estate in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
His wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1,487 of his 1,497 shares in the newly formed Bell Telephone Company.
Shortly thereafter, the newlyweds embarked on a year-long honeymoon in Europe.
During that excursion,  <START:person> Bell <END>  took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a "working holiday".
The courtship had begun years earlier; however,  <START:person> Bell <END>  waited until he was more financially secure before marrying.
Although the telephone appeared to be an "instant" success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897.
One unusual request exacted by his fiancée was that he use "Alec" rather than the family's earlier familiar name of "Aleck".
From 1876, he would sign his name " <START:person> Alec Bell <END> ".
They had four children:  <START:person> Elsie May Bell <END>  (1878–1964) who married  <START:person> Gilbert Grosvenor <END>  of National Geographic fame,  <START:person> Marian Hubbard Bell <END>  (1880–1962) who was referred to as "Daisy", and two sons who died in infancy ( <START:person> Edward <END>  in 1881 and  <START:person> Robert <END>  in 1883).
The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when  <START:person> Bell <END> 's father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C., and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for  <START:person> Bell <END> 's family, so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was a British subject throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882, when he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
In 1915, he characterized his status as: "I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries."
Despite this declaration,  <START:person> Bell <END>  has been proudly claimed as a "native son" by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated.
That summer, the Bells had a vacation on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck.
Returning in 1886,  <START:person> Bell <END>  started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake.
By 1889, a large house, christened "The Lodge" was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Bells would name  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END>  (Gaelic: "beautiful mountain") after  <START:person> Bell <END> 's ancestral Scottish highlands.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  also built the Bell Boatyard on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the Royal Canadian Navy and pleasure craft for the Bell family.
An enthusiastic boater,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his family sailed a rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the  <START:person> H.W. Embree <END>  and Sons boatyard in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia.
In his final, and some of his most productive years,  <START:person> Bell <END>  split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn Bhreagh where they spent increasing amounts of time.
Until the end of his life,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his family would alternate between the two homes, but "Beinn Bhreagh" would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as  <START:person> Bell <END>  became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened.
Both  <START:person> Mabel <END>  and  <START:person> Bell <END>  became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as "their own".
The Bells were still in residence at "Beinn Bhreagh" when the Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6, 1917.
 <START:person> Mabel <END>  and  <START:person> Bell <END>  mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax.
Later inventions.
Although  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied.
According to one of his biographers,  <START:person> Charlotte Gray <END> , Bell's work ranged "unfettered across the scientific landscape" and he often went to bed voraciously reading the "Encyclopædia Britannica", scouring it for new areas of interest.
The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators.
These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the photophone, one for the phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for "hydroairplanes" and two for selenium cells.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding alternative fuels.
Bell worked extensively in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf.
During his Volta Laboratory period,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound.
Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype.
They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the hard disc and floppy disc drive and other magnetic media.
Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice.
He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution.
Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories.
At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere.
In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses.
Photophone.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  and his assistant  <START:person> Charles Sumner Tainter <END>  jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a photophone, which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of light.
Both men later became full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association.
On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the Franklin School in Washington, D.C., to  <START:person> Bell <END>  at the window of his laboratory, some 213 m away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  believed the photophone's principles were his life's "greatest achievement", telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was "the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone".
The photophone was a precursor to the fiber-optic communication systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s.
Its master patent was issued in December 1880, many decades before the photophone's principles came into popular use.
Metal detector.
Bell is also credited with the invention of the metal detector in 1881.
The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President  <START:person> James Garfield <END> .
According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static.
The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored  <START:person> Bell <END> 's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs.
Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's own detailed account, presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet.
Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of  <START:person> Garfield <END> , Bell "...proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning...to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed.
It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires.
Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes.
The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect."
In a footnote,  <START:person> Bell <END>  adds that "The death of President  <START:person> Garfield <END>  and the subsequent "post-mortem" examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus."
Hydrofoils.
The March 1906 "Scientific American" article by American pioneer  <START:person> William E. Meacham <END>  explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and hydroplanes.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement.
Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat.
Bell and assistant  <START:person> Frederick W. <END>  "Casey"  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water.
 <START:person> Baldwin <END>  studied the work of the Italian inventor  <START:person> Enrico Forlanini <END>  and began testing models.
This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.
During his world tour of 1910–11,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  met with Forlanini in France.
They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore.
 <START:person> Baldwin <END>  described it as being as smooth as flying.
On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the "Dhonnas Beag", the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.
The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD-4, powered by Renault engines.
A top speed of 54 mph was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.
In 1913, Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END>  hired  <START:person> Walter Pinaud <END> , a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of  <START:person> Pinaud <END> 's Yacht Yard in Westmount, Nova Scotia to work on the pontoons of the HD-4.
 <START:person> Pinaud <END>  soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia.
 <START:person> Pinaud <END> 's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4.
After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4.
Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 hp engines in July 1919.
On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 mph, a record which stood for ten years.
Aeronautics.
In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft.
The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek "young" help as  <START:person> Bell <END>  was at the age of 60.
In 1898, Bell experimented with tetrahedral box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk.
The tetrahedral wings were named "Cygnet" I, II and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned ("Cygnet I" crashed during a flight carrying  <START:person> Selfridge <END> ) in the period from 1907–1912.
Some of Bell's kites are on display at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife  <START:person> Mabel <END>  and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate.
The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men: American  <START:person> Glenn H. Curtiss <END> , a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title "world's fastest man", having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the Scientific American Trophy for the first official one-kilometre flight in the Western hemisphere, and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant  <START:person> Thomas Selfridge <END> , an official observer from the U.S. Federal government and one of the few people in the army who believed that aviation was the future;  <START:person> Frederick W. Baldwin <END> , the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in Hammondsport, New York, and  <START:person> J.A.D. McCurdy <END>  — <START:person> Baldwin <END>  and  <START:person> McCurdy <END>  being new engineering graduates from the University of Toronto.
The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders.
Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the "Red Wing", framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine.
On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.
The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control).
One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the aileron, was to become a standard component on all aircraft.
The "White Wing" and "June Bug" were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished.
However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $15,000 grant from Mrs.  <START:person> Bell <END>  allowed it to continue with experiments.
Lt.  <START:person> Selfridge <END>  had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the Wright Flyer at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908.
Their final aircraft design, the "Silver Dart", embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines.
On February 23, 1909,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was present as the "Silver Dart" flown by  <START:person> J.A.D. McCurdy <END>  from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or, made the first aircraft flight in Canada.
Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand.
With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the "Silver Dart" would revert to  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  and  <START:person> McCurdy <END>  who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the Canadian Army.
Eugenics.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was connected with the eugenics movement in the United States.
In his lecture "Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race" presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry.
However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist  <START:person> David Starr Jordan <END> 's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the American Breeders Association.
The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man.
From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugenics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and regularly attended meetings.
In 1921, he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be, as  <START:person> Bell <END>  called them, a "defective variety of the human race".
By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany.
Legacy and honors.
Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his most famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew.
Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities, to the point that the requests almost became burdensome.
During his life he also received dozens of major awards, medals and other tributes.
These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created, notably the Bell Telephone Memorial erected in his honor in " <START:person> Alexander Graham <END>  Bell Gardens" in Brantford, Ontario, in 1917.
A large number of Bell's writings, personal correspondence, notebooks, papers and other documents reside at both the United States Library of Congress Manuscript Division (as the " <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  Family Papers"), and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute, Cape Breton University, Nova Scotia; major portions of which are available for online viewing.
A number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North America and Europe, including the first telephone companies of the United States and Canada.
Among the major sites are: In 1880, Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$ in today's dollars) for the invention of the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government.
Among the luminaries who judged were  <START:person> Victor Hugo <END>  and  <START:person> Alexandre Dumas <END> .
The Volta Prize was conceived by  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END>  in 1801, and named in honor of  <START:person> Alessandro Volta <END> , with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history.
Since  <START:person> Bell <END>  was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C..
These included the prestigious" 'Volta Laboratory Association' "(1880), also known as the" Volta Laboratory "and as the" ' <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  Laboratory', "and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.
The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that  <START:person> Edison <END>  himself later adopted.
The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his "proudest achievement", "the photophone", the "optical telephone" which presaged fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.
In partnership with  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s.
In 1888,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society and became its second president (1897–1904), and also became a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution (1898–1922).
The French government conferred on him the decoration of the Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor); the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 1902; the University of Würzburg, Bavaria, granted him a PhD, and he was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912.
He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884, and served as its president from 1891–92.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was later awarded the AIEE's Edison Medal in 1914 "For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone".
The "bel" (B) and the smaller "decibel" (dB) are units of measurement of sound intensity invented by Bell Labs and named after him.
Since 1976 the IEEE's  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell Medal <END>  has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications.
In 1936 the US Patent Office declared Bell first on its list of the country's greatest inventors, leading to the US Post Office issuing a commemorative stamp honoring Bell in 1940 as part of its 'Famous Americans Series'.
The First Day of Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston, Massachusetts, the city where  <START:person> Bell <END>  spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf.
The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time.
The stamp became, and remains to this day, the most valuable one of the series.
The 150th anniversary of Bell's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative £1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell's face in profile, his signature, and objects from Bell's life and career: users of the telephone over the ages; an audio wave signal; a diagram of a telephone receiver; geometric shapes from engineering structures; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet; the geese which helped him to understand flight; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics.
Additionally, the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C$100 gold coin, in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth, and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada.
That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END> 's tutelage, named the  <START:person> Silver Dart <END> .
Bell's image, and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money, coinage and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years.
 <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  was ranked 57th among the 100 Greatest Britons (2002) in an official BBC nationwide poll, and among the Top Ten Greatest Canadians (2004), and the 100 Greatest Americans (2005).
In 2006 Bell was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history after having been listed in the National Library of Scotland's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame'.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's name is still widely known and used as part of the names of dozens of educational institutes, corporate namesakes, street and place names around the world.
Honorary degrees.
 <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END> , who could not complete the university program of his youth, received at least a dozen honorary degrees from academic institutions, including eight honorary LL.D.s (Doctorate of Laws), two Ph.D.s, a D.Sc. and an M.D.: Death.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  died of complications arising from diabetes on August 2, 1922, at his private estate,  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END> , Nova Scotia, at age 75.
Bell had also been afflicted with pernicious anemia.
His last view of the land he had inhabited was by moonlight on his mountain estate at 2:00 A.M.
While tending to him after his long illness,  <START:person> Mabel <END> , his wife, whispered, "Don't leave me."
By way of reply,  <START:person> Bell <END>  traced the sign for "no" in the air —and then he died.
On learning of Bell's death, the Canadian Prime Minister,  <START:person> Mackenzie King <END> , cabled Mrs.  <START:person> Bell <END> , saying: "My colleagues in the Government join with me in expressing to you our sense of the world's loss in the death of your distinguished husband.
It will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention, with which his name is immortally associated, is a part of its history.
On the behalf of the citizens of Canada, may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's coffin was constructed of  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END>  pine by his laboratory staff, lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite experiments.
To help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests not to wear black (the traditional funeral color) while attending his service, during which soloist  <START:person> Jean MacDonald <END>  sang a verse of  <START:person> Robert Louis Stevenson <END> 's "Requiem": Upon the conclusion of Bell's funeral, "every phone on the continent of North America was silenced in honor of the man who had given to mankind the means for direct communication at a distance".
Dr.  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  was buried atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain, on his estate where he had resided increasingly for the last 35 years of his life, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake.
He was survived by his wife  <START:person> Mabel <END> , his two daughters,  <START:person> Elsie May <END>  and  <START:person> Marian <END> , and nine of his grandchildren.

"U.S. patent images in TIFF format"  Aaron  In the Hebrew Bible and the Quran,  <START:person> Aaron אַהֲרֹן <END>  () was the older brother of Moses (Exodus 6:16-20, 7:7; Qur'an 28:34), a prophet of God.
Unlike  <START:person> Moses <END> , who grew up in the Egyptian royal court,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his younger sister  <START:person> Miriam <END>  remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen).
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  served as his brother's spokesman ("prophet") to Pharaoh.
() Part of the Law (Torah) that  <START:person> Moses <END>  received from God at Sinai granted  <START:person> Aaron <END>  the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites.
Various dates for his life have been proposed, ranging from approximately 1600 to 1200 BC.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  died before the Israelites crossed the Jordan river and he was buried on Mount Hor (Numbers 33:39; Deuteronomy 10:6 says he died and was buried at Moserah.)  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible.
Account in the Hebrew Bible.
Traditional genealogy.
Descended from " <START:person> Abraham <END> ", " <START:person> Isaac <END> ", and "Jacob" Great-grandfather: "Levi" Grandfather: "Kohath" Father: "Amram" Mother: "Jochebed" Older Sister: " <START:person> Miriam <END> " Younger Brother: "Moses" Uncles: "Izhar", "Hebron", "Uzziel" Wife: "Elisheba" Sons: "Nadab, Abihu", "Eleazar", "Ithamar" Grandson: "Phinehas" According to the Book of Exodus,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  first functioned as  <START:person> Moses <END> ' assistant.
Because  <START:person> Moses <END>  complained that he could not speak well, God appointed  <START:person> Aaron <END>  as  <START:person> Moses <END> ' "prophet" (Exodus 4:10-17; 7:1).
At the command of  <START:person> Moses <END> , he let his rod turn into a snake (Exodus 7:9-12).
Then he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues (Exodus 7:19, 8:1,12).
After that,  <START:person> Moses <END>  tended to act and speak for himself (Exodus 9:23, 10:13,22).
During the journey in the wilderness,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was not always prominent or active.
At the battle with  <START:person> Amalek <END> , he was chosen with  <START:person> Hur <END>  to support the hand of Moses that held the "rod of God" (Exodus 17:9).
When the revelation was given to  <START:person> Moses <END>  at Mount Sinai, he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied  <START:person> Moses <END>  on the way to the summit.
While  <START:person> Joshua <END>  went with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to the top, however,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and  <START:person> Hur <END>  remained below to look after the people (Exodus 24:9-14).
From here on in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers,  <START:person> Joshua <END>  appears in the role of  <START:person> Moses <END> ' assistant while  <START:person> Aaron <END>  functions instead as the first high priest.
High Priest.
The books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers maintain that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  received from God a monopoly over the priesthood for himself and his male descendants (Exodus 28:1).
The family of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to the God of Israel.
The rest of his tribe, the Levites, were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary (Numbers 3).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  anointed and consecrated  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his sons to the priesthood, and arrayed them in the robes of office (Leviticus 8; cf.
Exodus 28-29).
He also related to them God's detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the Israelites listened (Leviticus 1-7, 11-27).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his successors as high priest were given control over the Urim and Thummim by which the will of God could be determined (Exodus 28:30).
God commissioned the Aaronide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean, and to teach the divine laws (the Torah) to the Israelites (Leviticus 10:10-11).
The priests were also commissioned to bless the people (Numbers 6:22-27).
When  <START:person> Aaron <END>  completed the altar offerings for the first time and, with  <START:person> Moses <END> , "blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people: And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces" (Leviticus 9:23-24).
In this way, the institution of the Aaronide priesthood was established.
In later books of the Old Testament,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later.
The books of Judges,  <START:person> Samuel <END>  and Kings mention priests and  <START:person> Levites <END> , but do not mention the Aaronides in particular.
The book of Ezekial, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King  <START:person> David <END> 's priests.
It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position.
A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and  <START:person> Levites <END>  appears in Ezra,  <START:person> Nehemiah <END>  and Chronicles.
As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel.
What is clear is that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period.
Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form early in this period, which may account for  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.
Leadership conflicts.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  plays a leading role in several stories of conflicts over leadership during Israel's wilderness wanderings.
During the prolonged absence of Moses on Mount Sinai, the people provoked  <START:person> Aaron <END>  to make a Golden Calf as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from Egypt (Exodus 32:1-6).
This incident nearly caused God to destroy the Israelites for their unfaithfulness to the covenant (Exodus 32:10).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  successfully intervened, but then led the loyal  <START:person> Levites <END>  in executing many of the culprits and a plague afflicted those who were left (Exodus 32:25-35).
 <START:person> Aaron <END> , however, escaped punishment for his role in the affair, because of the intercession of Moses according to Deuteronomy 9:20.
Later retellings of this story almost always excuse  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for his role.
For example, in rabbinic sources and in the Qur'an,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was not the idol-maker and upon  <START:person> Moses <END> ' return begged his pardon because he felt mortally threatened by the Israelites (Quran 7:142-152).
On the day of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's consecration, his oldest sons,  <START:person> Nadab <END>  and  <START:person> Abihu <END> , were burned up by divine fire because they offered "strange" incense (Leviticus 10:1-3).
Most interpreters think this story reflects a conflict between priestly families sometime in Israel's past.
Others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow God's instructions given through Moses.
The Pentateuch generally depicts the siblings, Moses,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , and  <START:person> Miriam <END> , as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus, a view also reflected in the biblical book of  <START:person> Micah <END> .
Numbers 12, however, reports that on one occasion,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and  <START:person> Miriam <END>  complained about  <START:person> Moses <END> ' exclusive claim to be the LORD's prophet.
Their presumption was rebuffed by God who affirmed  <START:person> Moses <END> ' uniqueness as the one with whom the LORD spoke face to face.
 <START:person> Miriam <END>  was punished with skin disease ("leprous"), that turned her skin white.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  pleaded with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to intercede for her, and  <START:person> Miriam <END> , after seven days' quarantine, was healed.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  once again escaped any retribution.
According to Numbers 16-17, a  <START:person> Levite <END>  named  <START:person> Korah <END>  led many in challenging  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's exclusive claim to the priesthood.
When the rebels were punished by being swallowed up by the earth, (Numbers 16:25-35),  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , the son of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests.
And when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).
To emphasize the validity of the  <START:person> Levites <END> ' claim to the offerings and tithes of the Israelites,  <START:person> Moses <END>  collected a rod from the leaders of each tribe in Israel and laid the twelve rods over night in the tent of meeting.
The next morning,  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds (Numbers 17:23).
The following chapter then details the distinction between  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's family and the rest of the Levites: while all the Levites (and only  <START:person> Levites <END> ) were devoted to the care of the sanctuary, charge of its interior and the altar was committed to the Aaronites alone (Numbers 18:1-7).
Death.
 <START:person> Aaron <END> , like  <START:person> Moses <END> , was not permitted to enter Canaan with the Israelites because the two brothers showed impatience at Meribah (Kadesh) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage (Numbers 20:12-13), when  <START:person> Moses <END>  brought water out of a rock to quench the people's thirst.
Though they had been commanded to speak to the rock,  <START:person> Moses <END>  struck it with the staff twice, which was construed as displaying a lack of deference to the LORD (Numbers 20:7-11).
There are two accounts of the death of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the Pentateuch.
Numbers says that soon after the incident at Meribah,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  with his son  <START:person> Eleazar <END>  and  <START:person> Moses <END>  ascended  <START:person> Mount Hor <END> .
There Moses stripped  <START:person> Aaron <END>  of his priestly garments and transferred them to  <START:person> Eleazar <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days (Numbers 20:22-29; compare 33:38-39).
The other account is found in Deuteronomy 10:6, where  <START:person> Aaron <END>  died at Moserah and was buried.
There is a significant amount of travel between these two points, as the itinerary in Numbers 33:31–37 records seven stages between Moseroth (Mosera) and  <START:person> Mount Hor <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  was 123 at the time of his death.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in religious traditions.
Jewish Rabbinic literature.
The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of God and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities.
Thus  <START:person> Aaron <END> , the first priest, ranks below Moses: he is his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of God revealed through Moses, although it is pointed out that it is said fifteen times in the Pentateuch that "the Lord spoke to Moses "and"  <START:person> Aaron <END> ."
Under the influence of the priesthood that shaped the destinies of the nation under Persian rule, a different ideal of the priest was formed, according to  <START:person> Malachi <END>  2:4–7, and the prevailing tendency was to place  <START:person> Aaron <END>  on a footing equal with  <START:person> Moses <END> .
"At times  <START:person> Aaron <END> , and at other times Moses, is mentioned first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank," says  <START:person> Mekilta <END> , who strongly implies this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's ministration.
In fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head ( <START:person> Leviticus Rabbah <END>  x., Midrash Teh.
cxxxiii.
1),  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death, as described in the Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquility.
Accompanied by  <START:person> Moses <END> , his brother, and by  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , his son,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view.
"Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son  <START:person> Eleazar <END> !" said  <START:person> Moses <END> ; "and then follow me."
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood.
"Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother,"  <START:person> Moses <END>  continued; and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  obeyed without a murmur.
Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God.
The cave closed behind  <START:person> Moses <END>  as he left; and he went down the hill with  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , with garments rent, and crying: "Alas,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , my brother!
thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!"
When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, "Where is  <START:person> Aaron <END> ?" angels were seen carrying  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's bier through the air.
A voice was then heard saying: "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" ( <START:person> Malachi <END>  2:6).
He died, according to Seder Olam Rabbah ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab."
The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and  <START:person> R. H. 2b-3a <END> ).
The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq.
and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner:  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of  <START:person> Arad <END> , in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for  <START:person> Aaron <END> ; wherefore it is said: "There [at Mosera] died  <START:person> Aaron <END> ."
The rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and Moses.
When the latter was appointed ruler and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one another's greatness.
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  at first declined to go to Pharaoh, saying: "O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send" (Exodus 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive  <START:person> Aaron <END> , his brother, of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but the Lord reassured him, saying: "Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart" ().
Indeed,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was to find his reward, says  <START:person> Shimon <END>  bar  <START:person> Yochai <END> ; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother's rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the Urim and Thummim, which were to "be upon  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's heart when he goeth in before the Lord" ( <START:person> Canticles Rabbah <END>  i. 10).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  met in gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers (Exodus 4:27; compare Song of Songs 8:1), and of them it is written: "Behold how good and how pleasant [it is] for brethren to dwell together in unity!" (Psalms 133:1).
Of them it is said: "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other]" (Psalms 85:10); for  <START:person> Moses <END>  stood for righteousness, according to Deuteronomy 33:21, and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for peace, according to .
Again, mercy was personified in  <START:person> Aaron <END> , according to Deuteronomy 33:8, and truth in Moses, according to Numbers 12:7 .
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  poured the oil of anointment upon the head of  <START:person> Aaron <END> ,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  modestly shrank back and said: "Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office."
Then the Shekhinah spoke the words: "Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of Hermon" () .
According to  <START:person> Tanhuma <END> ,  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's activity as a prophet began earlier than that of Moses.
 <START:person> Hillel <END>  held  <START:person> Aaron <END>  up as an example, saying: "Be of the disciples of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , loving peace and pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law!"
This is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in Abot de-Rabbi Natan 12, Sanhedrin 6b, and elsewhere, according to which  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was an ideal priest of the people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was Moses.
While  <START:person> Moses <END>  was stern and uncompromising, brooking no wrong,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  went about as peacemaker, reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse.
The mourning of the people at  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death was greater, therefore, than at that of Moses; for whereas, when  <START:person> Aaron <END>  died the whole house of Israel wept, including the women, (Numbers 20:29)  <START:person> Moses <END>  was bewailed by "the sons of Israel" only (Deuteronomy 34:8).
Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
His fortitude and silent submission to the will of God on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify God in the midst of great affliction.
Especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by God after the princes of the Twelve Tribes had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: "Say to thy brother  <START:person> Aaron <END> : Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light shall last forever."
Christianity.
In the Eastern Orthodox and Maronite churches,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is venerated as a saint whose feast day is shared with his brother  <START:person> Moses <END>  and celebrated on September 4. (Those churches that follow the traditional Julian Calendar celebrate this day on September 17 of the modern Gregorian Calendar).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is also commemorated with other Old Testament saints on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers, the Sunday before Christmas.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 30.
He is commemorated on July 1 in the modern Latin calendar and in the Syriac Calendar.
In The Church of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  of Latter-day Saints, the Aaronic order is the lesser order of priesthood, comprising the grades (from lowest to highest) of deacon, teacher, and priest.
The chief office of the Aaronic priesthood is the presiding bishopric; the head of the priesthood is the bishop.
Each ward includes a quorum of one or more of each office of the Aaronic priesthood.
In the Community of Christ, the Aaronic order of priesthood is regarded as an appendage to the Melchisedec order, and consists of the priesthood offices of deacon, teacher, and priest.
While differing in responsibilities, these offices, along with those of the Melchisidec order, are regarded as equal before God.
Islam.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Arabic: هارون, "Hārūn") is also mentioned in the Quran as a prophet of God.
The Quran praises  <START:person> Aaron <END>  repeatedly, calling him a "believing servant" as well as one who was "guided" and one of the "victors".
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is important in Islam for his role in the events of the Exodus, in which, according to the Quran and Muslim tradition, he preached with his brother  <START:person> Moses <END>  to the Pharaoh of the Exodus.
 <START:person> Aaron <END> 's significance in Islam, however, is not limited to his role as the helper of Moses.
Islamic tradition also accords  <START:person> Aaron <END>  the role of a patriarch, as tradition records that the priestly descent came through  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's lineage, which included the entire House of Amran.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the Quran.
The Qur'an contains numerous references to  <START:person> Aaron <END> , both by name and without name.
It says that he was a descendant of  <START:person> Abraham <END>  (Qur'an 4: 163) and makes it clear that both he and  <START:person> Moses <END>  were sent together to warn the Pharaoh about God's punishment (Qur'an 10: 75).
It further adds that  <START:person> Moses <END>  had earlier prayed to God to strengthen his own ministry with  <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Qur'an 20: 29-30) and that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  helped  <START:person> Moses <END>  as he too was a prophet (Qur'an 19: 53) and was very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse (Qur'an 28: 34).
The Qur'an adds that both Moses and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the Israelites in Egypt, and to convert those houses into places of worship for God (Qur'an 10: 87).
The incident of the Golden Calf as it is narrated in the Qur'an paints  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in a positive light.
The Qur'an says that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was entrusted the leadership of Israel while  <START:person> Moses <END>  was up on Mount Sinai for a period of forty days (Qur'an 7: 142).
It adds that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf, which was built not by  <START:person> Aaron <END>  but by a wicked man by the name of  <START:person> Samiri <END>  (Qur'an 19: 50).
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  returned from Mount Sinai, he rebuked  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for allowing the worship of the idol, to which  <START:person> Aaron <END>  pleaded with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to not blame him when he had no role in its construction (Qur'an 7: 150).
The Qur'an then adds that  <START:person> Moses <END>  here lamented the sins of Israel and said he only had the power to protect himself and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Qur'an 5: 25).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is later commemorated in the Qur'an as one who had a "clear authority" (Qur'an 23: 45) and one who was "guided to the Right Path" (Qur'an 37: 118).
It further adds that  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's memory was left for people who came after him (Qur'an 37: 119) and he is blessed by God along with his brother (Qur'an 37: 120).
The Qur'an also calls the  <START:person> Virgin Mary <END>  a "sister of Aaron" (Qur'an 19: 28).
Muslim scholars debated as to who exactly this "Aaron" was in terms of his historical persona, with some saying that it was a reference to  <START:person> Aaron <END>  of the Exodus, and the term "sister" designating only a metaphorical or spiritual link between the two figures, all the more evident when  <START:person> Mary <END>  was a descendant of the priestly lineage of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , while others held it to be another righteous man living at the time of  <START:person> Christ <END>  by the name of "Aaron".
Most scholars have agreed to the former perspective, and have linked  <START:person> Mary <END>  spiritually with the actual sister of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , her namesake  <START:person> Miriam <END> , whom she resembled in many ways.
The Qur'an also narrates that, centuries later, when the Ark of the Covenant returned to Israel, it contained "relics from the family of  <START:person> Moses <END>  and relics from the family of  <START:person> Aaron <END> " (Qur'an 2: 248).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's time.
 <START:person> Muhammad <END> , in many of his sayings, speaks of  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
In the event of the Mi'raj, his miraculous ascension through the Heavens,  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  is said to have encountered  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the fifth heaven.
According to old scholars, including  <START:person> Ibn Hisham <END> ,  <START:person> Muhammad <END> , in particular, mentioned the beauty of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  when he encountered him in Heaven.
 <START:person> Martin Lings <END> , in his biographical " <START:person> Muhammad <END> ", speaks of  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's wonderment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory: Of  <START:person> Joseph <END>  he said that his face had the splendour of the moon at its full, and that he had been endowed with no less than the half of all existing beauty.
Yet this did not diminish  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's wonderment at his other brethren, and he mentioned in particular the great beauty of  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  was also mentioned by  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  in likeness to  <START:person> Ali <END> .
 <START:person> Muhammad <END>  had left  <START:person> Ali <END>  to look after his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found  <START:person> Ali <END>  a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence.
 <START:person> Ali <END> , grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  what the local people were saying.
In reply, the  <START:person> Prophet <END>  said: "They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me.
So return and represent me in my family and in thine.
Art thou not content,  <START:person> O Ali <END> , that thou should be unto me as  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was unto  <START:person> Moses <END> , save that after me there is no prophet.
" Burial Place.
According to Islamic tradition the tomb of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is located on "Jabal Harun", or  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's Mountain, near Petra in Jordan.
At 1350 meters above sea-level it is the highest peak in the area; and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here.
A 14th-century Mamluk mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around Petra.
Baha'i.
Although his father is described as both an apostle and a prophet,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is merely described as a prophet.
The Kitab-I-Iqan describes  <START:person> Imran <END>  as being his father.
Descendants.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  married  <START:person> Elisheba <END> , daughter of  <START:person> Amminadab <END>  and sister of  <START:person> Nahshon <END>  (Exodus 6:23) of the tribe of  <START:person> Judah <END> .
The sons of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  were  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , Ithamar, and Nadab and  <START:person> Abihu <END> .
A descendant of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is an Aaronite, or  <START:person> Kohen <END> , meaning Priest.
Any non-Aaronic  <START:person> Levite <END> —i.e., descended from  <START:person> Levi <END>  but not from  <START:person> Aaron <END> —assisted the Levitical priests of the family of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the care of the tabernacle; later of the temple.

Art history.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  appears paired with  <START:person> Moses <END>  frequently in Jewish and Christian art, especially in the illustrations of manuscript and printed Bibles.
He can usually be distinguished by his priestly vestments, especially his turban or miter and jeweled breastplate.
He frequently holds a censor or, sometimes, his flowering rod.
(See at Wikimedia Commons.)
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  also appears in scenes depicting the wilderness Tabernacle and its altar, as already in the third-century frescos in the synagogue at Dura-Europos in Syria.
An eleventh-century portable silver altar from Fulda, Germany depicts  <START:person> Aaron <END>  with his censor, and is located in the Musée National de l’Age Médiévale in Paris.
This is also how he appears in the frontispieces of early printed Passover Haggadot and occasionally in church sculptures.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  has rarely been the subject of portraits, such as those by  <START:person> Anton Kern <END>  [1710–1747] and by  <START:person> Pier Francesco Mola <END>  [c.

Christian artists sometimes portray  <START:person> Aaron <END>  as a prophet (Exod.
7:1) holding a scroll, as in a twelfth-century sculpture from the Cathedral of Noyon in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and often in Eastern Orthodox icons.
Illustrations of the Golden Calf story usually include him as well—most notably in  <START:person> Nicolas Poussin <END> 's "The Adoration of the Golden Calf" (ca.
1633–34, National Gallery London).
Finally, some artists interested in validating later priesthoods have painted the ordination of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his sons (Leviticus 8).
 <START:person> Harry Anderson <END> 's realistic portrayal is often reproduced in the literature of the Latter Day Saints.

</dl>  Economy of Armenia  Armenia is the second most densely populated of the former Soviet republics because of its small size.
It is situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, bordered on the north and east by Georgia and Azerbaijan and on the south and west by Iran and Turkey.
Until independence, Armenia's economy was based largely on industry—chemicals, electronic products, machinery, processed food, synthetic rubber and textiles; it was highly dependent on outside resources.
Agriculture accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold and lead.
The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant) from Russia; the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric.
Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.
Like other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns.
Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function.
In addition, the effects of the 1988 earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt.
Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved.
The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials.
Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable.
In 1992-93, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level.
The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.
Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years.
New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily Armentel, which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors).
This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans.
Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed $800 million.
These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the earthquake zone.
Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and accelerating privatization.
A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization.
The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization.
By 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005.
Armenia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2003.
Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most smalland medium-sized enterprises.
Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth.
The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under international pressure to close.
The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002.
Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment.
Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector.
The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in 2005, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement.
Investment in the construction and industrial sectors is expected to continue in 2006 and will help to ensure annual average real GDP growth of about 13.9%.
Overview.
Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy.
Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era.
The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology.
The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration.
Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (gold and bauxite) are small.
The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.
By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-99.
Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most smalland medium-sized enterprises.
The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic restructuring and foreign direct investment.
History of the modern Armenian economy.
Armenia emerged from the umbra of the former Soviet Union in 1991 and migrated from a centrally planned economy (Communist system) to a market economy (capitalist system).
Both the nation and the economy are nascent.
Regional conflict retards economic growth.
In addition, the border with Turkey is closed, making access to sea ports difficult and transportation logistics challenging to a country largely dependent upon imports.
In 2003, Armenia became a member of the WTO.
The nation is making substantial progress in privatizing ownership of what used to be state-owned industries under the former Soviet system.
Despite marked progress, Armenia still suffers from a large trade imballance and is still largely dependent upon foreign aid and remittances from Armenian nationals working abroad, and members of the diaspora donating aid through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as churchES.
There are some foreign capital inflows, but no robust foreign investment.
Despite progress since the Soviet era, the unemployment rate still hovers near 30% and there remains a huge gulf between actual and potential Gross Domestic Product.
Global competitiveness.
The Armenian economy's competitiveness is low and stagnating according to the Global Competitiveness Index, in which Armenia's ranking slipped from 80th out of 132 countries in 2006-2007 index to 93rd out of 131 countries in the 2007-2008 index (just below Libya, Namibia, Georgia, Serbia and Pakistan).
Armenia ranks 82nd out of 144 economies according to the 2012-2013 Global Competitiveness Index.
Index of Economic Freedom.
Armenia ranks 39th out of 179 economies according to the 2012 Index of Economic Freedom.
Armenia is ranked 19th freest among the 43 countries in the Europe region, putting it above the world and regional averages.
Domestic business environment.
Armenia ranks 32nd out of 185 economies according to the 2013 ease of doing business index .
Armenia's economy is competitive to a few extent with government-connected individuals enjoying de facto monopolies over the import and distribution of basic commodities and foodstuffs, and under-reporting revenue to avoid paying taxes.
Despite pronouncements at the highest levels of government on the importance of free competition, Armenia is next to last in the effectiveness of its anti-monopoly policy according to the 2010 results of the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.
According to  <START:person> Vahram Nercissiantz <END> , President  <START:person> Serzh Sargsyan <END> 's chief economic adviser, "Businessmen holding state positions have turned into oligarchs who have avoided paying sufficient taxes by abusing their state positions, distorted markets with unequal conditions, breached the rules of competition, impeded or prevented small and medium-sized business’ entry into manufacturing and thereby sharply deepened social polarization in the republic.
Following the advice of economic advisors who cautioned Armenia's leadership against the consolidation of economic power in the hands of a few, in January 2001, the Government of Armenia established the .
Its members cannot be dismissed by the government.
Monopolies.
According to one analyst, Armenia's economic system is anticompetitive due to the structure of the economy being a type of "monopoly or oligopoly".
"The result is the prices with us do not drop even if they do on international market, or they do quite belated and not to the size of the international market."
According to the estimate of a former prime minister,  <START:person> Hrant Bagratian <END> , 55 percent of Armenia's GDP is controlled by 44 families.
In early 2008, the State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition named 60 companies having "dominant positions" in Armenia.
In October 2009, when visiting Yerevan, the World Bank’s managing director, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, warned that Armenia will not reach a higher level of development unless its leadership changes the "oligopolistic" structure of the national economy, bolsters the rule of law and shows "zero tolerance" towards corruption.
"I think you can only go so far with this economic model,"  <START:person> Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala <END>  told a news conference in Yerevan.
"Armenia is a lower middle-income country.
If it wants to become a high-income or upper middle-income country, it can not do so with this kind of economic structure.
That is clear."
She also called for a sweeping reform of tax and customs administration, the creation of a "strong and independent judicial system" as well as a tough fight against government corruption.
The warning was echoed by the International Monetary Fund.
Major monopolies in Armenia include: "Former" major monopolies in Armenia include: GDP.
The Gross Domestic Product of Armenia stood at 8.8 billion US dollars in 2010; with a population of 3.2 million, this amounts to a GDP per capita of $2,676 (purchasing power parity $5,178).
GDP growth for 2010 was at 2.9 percent, and inflation was at 8 percent.
GDP growth is expected to be around 3 percent in 2011, with inflation returning to 4-5 percent.
In comparison, in 2006, the GDP was estimated to be 6.6 billion USD per calendar year and the GDP per capita (purchasing power parity) was estimated at $5,400 US.
The growth rate was high at 13.4%, but the relatively low base must be considered.
Low inflation was maintained around 2.6% annually.
Growth.
After a decade of double-digit growth, Armenia's economy declined by 14.4 percent in 2009.
The year-to-date growth as of October 2010 was 2.8 percent.
In 2010, the main macro deficiencies of the Armenian economy — namely, unsustainable growth drivers, a narrow and resource-dominated export base, and overdependence on private transfers — were still prevalent.
According to official figures, Armenia’s economy grew by 13.8 percent in 2007.
According to research funded by the USAID CAPS project, Armenia's exceptionally high rate of economic growth during the last decade has been largely dependent on external factors (e.g., remittances, assistance from international financial and donor organization).
Furthermore, the study concluded that despite its record growth on most macro-economic metrics, Armenia is "low and lagging" in competitiveness.
According to the National Statistical Service, the booming construction and service sectors remain the driving forces of the high growth rate of GDP.
Cash remittances.
Cash remittances sent back home from Armenians working abroad—mostly in Russia and the United States—are growing and contribute significantly to Armenia's Gross Domestic Product (between 15 to 30 percent).
They help Armenia sustain double-digit economic growth and finance its massive trade deficit.
According to the Central Bank of Armenia, during the first half of 2008, cash remittances sent back to Armenia by Armenians working abroad rose by 57.5 percent and totaled $668.6 million USD, equivalent to 15 percent of the country's first-half Gross Domestic Product.
However, the latter figures only represent cash remittances processed through Armenian commercial banks.
According to RFE/RL, comparable sums are believed to be transferred through non-bank systems, implying that cash remittances make up approximately 30 percent of Armenia's GDP in the first half of 2008.
In 2007, cash remittances through bank transfers rose by 37 percent to a record-high level of $1.32 billion USD.
According to the Central Bank of Armenia, in 2005, cash remittances from Armenians working abroad reached a record-high level of $1 billion, which is worth more than one fifth of the country’s 2005 Gross Domestic Product.
Net private transfers decreased in 2009, but saw a continuous increase during the first six months of 2010.
Since private transfers from the Diaspora tend to be mostly injected into consumption of imports and not in high value-added sectors, the transfers have not resulted in sizeable increases in productivity.
Secondary sector.
Armenia experienced a construction boom during the latter part of the 2000s.
According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's booming construction sector generated about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP during the first eight months of 2007.
According to a World Bank official, 30 percent of Armenia's economy in 2009 came from the construction sector.
However, during the January to September 2010 period, the sector experienced a 5.2 percent year-on-year decrease, which according to the Civilitas Foundation is an indication of the unsustainability of a sector based on an elite market, with few products for the median or low budgets.
This decrease comes despite the fact that an important component of the government stimulus package was to support the completion of ongoing construction projects.
Retail trade.
In 2010, retail trade turnover was largely unaltered compared to 2009.
The existing monopolies throughout the retail sector have made the sector non-responsive to the crisis and resulted in near zero growth.
The aftermath of the crisis has started to shift the structure in the retail sector in favor of food products.
Services sector.
In the 2000s, along with the construction sector, the services sector was the driving force behind Armenia's recent high economic growth rate.
In 2010, the volume of services increased as much as 7.4 percent from January to September, over the same period in 2009.
Tourism.
According to official data, in 2007, a record-high 500,000 tourists visited Armenia — most of them ethnic Armenians from Europe, Russia and the United States.
2010 saw a noticeable increase in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Armenia – estimated to be 80,000.
However, according to private tour operators and other individuals familiar with the country’s tourism industry, government claims that hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Armenia each year are inflated.
Official statistics show that as many 575,000 tourists visited Armenia from abroad in 2009; the government stated earlier in 2010 that the figure will surpass 620,000 in 2010.
However, data from the National Statistical Service shows that there were only 65,000 foreigners staying in Armenian hotels in 2009.
 <START:person> Ara Vartanian <END> , the chairman of the Armenian Trade and Industry Chamber, thinks that this measure is a far more objective indicator of the tourist influx into the country.
In 2012, as many as 843'330 tourists visited Armenia.
Industrial sector.
Industrial output was relatively positive throughout 2010, with year-on-year average growth of 10.9 percent in the period January to September 2010, due largely to the mining sector where higher global demand for commodities led to higher prices.
According to the National Statistical Service, during the January–August 2007 period, Armenia's industrial sector was the single largest contributor to the country's GDP, but remained largely stagnant with industrial output increasing only by 1.7 percent per year.
In 2005, Armenia's industrial output (including electricity) made up about 30 percent of GDP.
Mining.
40 percent of Armenia's exports in 2009 were mining exports.
Agricultural sector.
As of 2010, the agricultural production comprises on average 25 percent of Armenia's GDP.
In 2006, the agricultural sector accounted for about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP.
Armenia's agricultural output dropped by 17.9 percent in the period of January–September 2010.
This was owing to bad weather, a lack of a government stimulus package, and the continuing effects of decreased agricultural subsidies by the Armenian government (per WTO requirements).
Foreign aid.
United States.
The Armenian government receives foreign aid from the government of the United States through the United States Agency for International Development and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.
On March 27, 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $235.65 million compact with the Government of Armenia.
The single stated goal of the "Armenian Compact" is "the reduction of rural poverty through a sustainable increase in the economic performance of the agricultural sector."
The compact includes a $67 million to rehabilitate up to 943 kilometers of rural roads, more than a third of Armenia's proposed "Lifeline road network".
The Compact also includes a $146 million project to increase the productivity of approximately 250,000 farm households through improved water supply, higher yields, higher-value crops, and a more competitive agricultural sector.
In 2010, the volume of US assistance to Armenia remained near 2009 levels; however, longer-term decline continued.
The original Millennium Challenge Account commitment for $235 million had been reduced to about $175 million due to Armenia’s poor governance record.
Thus, the MCC would not complete road construction.
Instead, the irrigated agriculture project was headed for completion with apparently no prospects for extension beyond 2011.
European Union.
With curtailment of the MCC funding, the European Union may replace the US as Armenia’s chief source of foreign aid for the first time since independence.
From 2011 to 2013, the European Union is expected to advance at least €157.3 million ($208 million) in aid to Armenia.
External trade.
Exports.
In 2010, Armenia’s exports remained resource-dependent, largely because the non-resource-intensive sectors were significantly less competitive.
Armenia has not succeeded in increasing and diversifying exports beyond raw materials thus leaving room for a greater vulnerability to external shocks.
There was a 43.9 percent increase in overall exports during the January to September period.
The main three export destinations were Bulgaria with 15.2 percent of total exports, followed by Germany with 14.2 percent and Russia with 13.9 percent.
Raw minerals were the main export sent to Bulgaria and Germany.
Imports.
The global economic crisis has had less impact on imports because the sector is more diversified than exports.
In the first nine months of 2010, imports grew about 19 percent, just about equal to the decline of the same sector in 2009.
Deficit.
During the first half of 2008, Armenia's widening current-account trade deficit grew by 66 percent to $1.39 billion USD, with a 40 percent rise in imports.
Furthermore, Armenian exports fell by about one percent to $520 million USD.
According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's trade deficit in 2006 was $1.2 billion with growth in exports being largely flat.
During the first 11 months of 2006, net imports grew by 21 percent to $1.95 billion, while exports stood at $895 million, up 0.3 percent from the same period in 2005.
Partners.
European Union.
In 2010, EU countries accounted for 32.1 percent of Armenia’s foreign trade.
Germany is Armenia’s largest trading partner among EU member states, accounting for 7.2 percent of trade; this is due largely to mining exports.
Armenian exports to EU countries have skyrocketed by 65.9 percent, making up more than half of all 2010 January to September exports.
Imports from EU countries increased by 17.1 percent, constituting 22.5 percent of all imports.
During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with the European Union totaled $200 million.
During the first 11 months of 2006, the European Union remained Armenia's largest trading partner, accounting for 34.4 percent of its $2.85 billion commercial exchange during the 11-month period.
Russia and former Soviet republics.
Bilateral trade with Russia stood at more than $700 million for the first nine months of 2010 – on track to rebound to $1 billion mark first reached in 2008 prior to the global economic crisis.
During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with Russia and other former Soviet republics was $205.6 million (double the amount from the same period the previous year), making them the country’s number one trading partner.
During the first 11 months of 2006, the volume of Armenia’s trade with Russia was $376.8 million or 13.2 percent of the total commercial exchange.
China.
As of early 2011, trade with China is dominated by imports of Chinese goods and accounts for about 10 percent of Armenia's foreign trade.
The volume of Chinese-Armenian trade soared by 55 percent to $390 million in January–November 2010.
Armenian exports to China, though still modest in absolute terms, nearly doubled in that period.
Iran.
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Iran was $200 million which is approximately equal to the trade between Armenia and Turkey.
The number of Iranian tourists has risen in recent years, with an estimated 80,000 Iranian tourists in 2010.
Turkey.
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Turkey was about $200 million, with trade taking place without open borders, across Georgian territory.
This figure is not expected to increase significantly so long as the land border between the Armenia and Turkey remains closed.
United States.
From January–September 2010, bilateral trade with the United States measured approximately $150 million, on track for about a 30 percent increase over 2009.
An increase in Armenia’s exports to the US in 2009 and 2010 has been due to shipments of aluminum foil.
During the first 11 months of 2006, U.S.-Armenian trade totaled $152.6 million.
Georgia.
The volume of Georgian-Armenian trade remains modest in both relative and absolute terms.
According to official Armenian statistics, it rose by 11 percent to $91.6 million in January–November 2010.
The figure was equivalent to just over 2 percent of Armenia’s overall foreign trade.
Foreign debt.
Armenia's national debt has increased significantly since 2008 when public external debt consisted of only 13.5 percent of GDP.
By the end of 2010, Armenia’s external debt is projected to form about 42 percent of GDP, and 50 percent in 2012.
As of late November 2009, the Armenian government's foreign debt was around $3 billion USD, having doubled in size over the course of the previous year.
With the Armenian government needing more anti-crisis loans from the World Bank and other foreign donors, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to exceed 40 percent in 2010.
According to a World Bank official, a country that has around 12 percent rate of growth or even lower, at the range of 7 to 8 percent, can afford a level of public debt of up to 50 percent.
The official warned that the debt servicing payments of the Armenian government will surge by 2013 and absorb "quite significant part of tax revenues."
According to another estimate, the ratio between the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the state's foreign debt has reached 46 percent.
Economists generally agree that a country is insolvent, if its foreign debt surpasses 50 percent of its GDP.
Critics of the government say that the $500 million credit from Russia should have gone to develop industry, instead of going to the construction sector.
Transportation routes and energy lines.
Internal.
Since early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway.
Through Georgia.
Russian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.
The only operational rail link into Armenia is from Georgia.
During Soviet times, Armenia's rail network connected to Russia's via Georgia through Abkhazia along the Black Sea.
However, the rail link between Abkhazia and Georgia proper has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports.
The Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi and  <START:person> Poti <END>  process more than 90 percent of freight shipped to and from landlocked Armenia.
The Georgian railway, which runs through the town of Gori in central Georgia, is the main transport link between Armenia and the aforementioned Georgian seaports.
Fuel, wheat and other basic commodities are transported to Armenia by rail.
Armenia's main rail and road border-crossing with Georgia (at ) is along the Debed river near the Armenian town of Bagratashen and the Georgian town of Sadakhlo.
The Upper Lars border crossing (at Darial Gorge) between Georgia and Russia across the Caucasus Mountains served as Armenia's sole overland route to the former Soviet Union and Europe.
It was controversially shut down by the Russian authorities in June 2006, at the height of a Russian-Georgian spy scandal.
Upper  <START:person> Lars <END>  is the only land border crossing that does not go through Georgia's Russian-backed breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The other two roads linking Georgia and Russia run through South Ossetia and Abkhazia, effectively barring them to international traffic.
This crossing is expected to reopen starting on March 1, 2010.
Through Turkey and Azerbaijan.
An economic blockade with Turkey and Azerbaijan has cut Armenia's rail link between  <START:person> Gyumri <END>  and Kars to Turkey; the rail link with Iran through the Azeri exclave of Nakhichevan; and a natural gas and oil pipeline line with Azerbaijan.
Also non-functioning are roads with Turkey and Azerbaijan.
Despite the economic blockade of Turkey on Armenia, every day dozens of Turkish trucks laden with goods enter Armenia through Georgia.
In 2010, it was confirmed that Turkey will keep the border closed for the foreseeable future after the Turkey-Armenia normalization process collapsed.
Through Iran.
A new gas pipeline to Iran has been completed, and a road to Iran through the southern city of Meghri allows trade with that country.
An oil pipeline to pump Iranian oil products is also in the planning stages.
As of October 2008, the Armenian government is considering implementing an ambitious project to build a railway to Iran.
The 400 kilometer railway would pass through Armenia's mountainous southern province of Syunik, which borders Iran.
Economic analysts say that the project would cost at least $1 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of Armenia's 2008 state budget).
As of 2010, the project has been continuously delayed, with the rail link estimated to cost as much as $4 billion and stretch 313 km.
In June 2010, Transport Minister  <START:person> Manuk Vartanian <END>  revealed that Yerevan is seeking as much as $1 billion in loans from China to finance the railway’s construction.
Labor.
Monthly wages.
According to the state-owned Armenpress news agency, the average monthly wage in Armenia for the first half of 2007 was 70,700 drams (about $210 USD).
As of April 24, 2008, the average monthly salary is 75,000 drams (about $242 US dollars).
According to the ROA National Statistical Service, the average monthly salary during January June 2008 is 86,850 drams (about $287 at the time).
About 62% of officially registered wage earners earn at least the average monthly wage, while only 19.6% receive a monthly salary of over 100,000 drams (about $330 at the time).
Unemployment.
According to research commissioned by the Yerevan office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), at least one in three working-age Armenians was unemployed as of February 2005 despite several consecutive years of double-digit economic growth.
The finding sharply contrasts with government's official unemployment rate of about 10 percent.
A 2003 household survey conducted by the National Statistical Survey found that the real unemployment rate is about 33 percent.
Migrant workers.
Since gaining independence in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Armenia's residents have gone abroad, mainly to Russia, in search of work.
Unemployment has been the major cause of this massive labor emigration.
OSCE experts estimate that between 116,000 and 147,000 people left Armenia for economic reasons between 2002 and 2004, with two-thirds of them returning home by February 2005.
According to estimates by the National Statistical Survey, the rate of labor emigration was twice as higher in 2001 and 2002.
According to an OSCE survey, a typical Armenian migrant worker is a married man aged between 41 and 50 years who "began looking for work abroad at the age of 32-33."
Appreciation and depreciation of the dram.
In 2010, the value of the Armenian Dram (AMD) was artificially kept high during the height of the global economic crisis.
Had the AMD been allowed to depreciate to its market level, exports would have become more competitive and the purchasing power of the majority of the population who are dependent on remittances from abroad would have increased.
Instead, the value of the AMD was kept high, out of a fear of inflation and concern about alienating the powerful government-connected importers of oil, sugar, flour, cigarettes and beverages.
The AMD/USD exchange rate depreciated by 6.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, before it began to show the expected end-of-the-year appreciation.
In comparison between the January to October periods of 2010 and 2009, depreciation stands at 4.7 percent.
Government revenue and taxation.
The Armenian government collected 383.5 billion drams ($1.26 billion) in various taxes in the first nine months of 2008 (a 33.2 percent increase from the same period last year).
Many large companies have a privileged status when it comes to taxation.
Big business is not taxed in proportion to its capacity and output, and the disproportionate burden falls on small and medium size businesses.
New value-added tax.
Over half of the tax revenues in the January–August 2008 time period were generated from value-added taxes (VAT).
By comparison, corporate profit tax generated less than 16 percent of the revenues.
This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens, rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenia's double-digit economic growth in recent years).
Tax evasion.
Many Armenian companies, especially those owned by government-connected tycoons, have long reported suspiciously low earnings, thereby avoiding paying larger taxes.
Environmental issues.
Armenia is trying to "address its environmental problems".
It has established a Ministry of Environment and has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal.The resulting revenues are used for unknown purposes.
Armenia doesn't seem to be interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (a group of 12 former Soviet republics) or with members of the international community on environmental issues.
The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant and has already made an agreement with Russian "businessmen" about the construction and operation and ownage of a new Nuclear power plant.
Banking.
Armenia's financial system is not integrated into the global network.
According to the head of the Armenian Central Bank’s (CBA) department for financial system policies and analyses ( <START:person> Vahe Vardanyan <END> ) Armenian banks have no large asset concentrations in foreign markets, particularly in capital markets.
They nearly have no purchased securities (so-called securitized packages).
For this reason, Armenia was virtually unaffected by the Liquidity crisis of September 2008.
Armenian banking assets are very low and make up only 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Takeover of Armenian industrial property by the Russian state and Russian companies.
Since 2000, the Russian state has acquired several key assets in the energy sector and Soviet-era industrial plants.
Property-for-debt or equity-for-debt swaps (acquiring ownership by simply writing off the Armenian government's debts to Russia) are usually the method of acquiring assets.
The failure of market reforms, clan-based economics, and official corruption in Armenia have allowed the success of this process.
In August 2002, the Armenian government sold an 80 percent stake in the Armenian Electricity Network (AEN) to Midland Resources, a British offshore-registered firm which is said to have close Russian connections.
In September 2002, the Armenian government handed over Armenia’s largest cement factory to the Russian ITERA gas exporter in payment for its $10 million debt for past gas deliveries.
On November 5, 2002, Armenia transferred control of 5 state enterprises to Russia in an assets-for-debts transaction which settled $100 million of Armenian state debts to Russia.
The document was signed for Russia by Prime Minister  <START:person> Mikhail Kasyanov <END>  and Industry Minister  <START:person> Ilya Klebanov <END> , while Prime Minister  <START:person> Andranik Markarian <END>  and National Security Council Secretary  <START:person> Serge Sarkisian <END>  signed for Armenia.
The five enterprises which passed to 100 percent Russian state ownership are: In January 2003, the Armenian government and United Company RUSAL signed an investment cooperation agreement, under which United Company RUSAL (which already owned a 76% stake) acquired the Armenian government's remaining 26% share of RUSAL ARMENAL aluminum foil mill, giving RUSAL 100% ownership of RUSAL ARMENAL.
On November 1, 2006, the Armenian government handed de facto control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline to Russian company Gazprom and increased Gazprom's stake in the Russian-Armenian company ArmRosGazprom from 45% to 58% by approving an additional issue of shares worth $119 million.
This left the Armenian government with a 32% stake in ArmRosGazprom.
The transaction will also help finance ArmRosGazprom's acquisition of the Hrazdan electricity generating plant’s fifth power bloc (Hrazdan-5), the leading unit in the country.
In October 2008 the Russian bank Gazprombank, the banking arm of Gazprom, acquired 100 percent of Armenian bank Areximbank after previously buying 80 percent of said bank in November 2007 and 94.15 percent in July of the same year.
Controversy over non-transparent deals.
Critics of the  <START:person> Kocharian <END>  government say that the Armenian administration never considered alternative ways of settling the Russian debts.
According to economist  <START:person> Eduard Aghajanov <END> , Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million.
Furthermore,  <START:person> Aghajanov <END>  points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector – abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.
Political observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government’s work.
The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and now President)  <START:person> Serge Sarkisian <END> ,  <START:person> Kocharian <END> ’s closest political associate.
Other top government officials, including Prime Minister  <START:person> Andranik Markarian <END> , had little say on the issue.
Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after  <START:person> Sarkisian <END> ’s frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.
Finally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multimillion-dollar debts to Russia over the past decade, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia.
For example, pro-Western Ukraine and Georgia (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.

 <START:person> Alfonso Cuarón  Alfonso Cuarón Orozco <END>  (]; born November 28, 1961) is a Mexican film director, screenwriter, producer and editor best known for his dramas "A Little Princess" (1995) and "Y Tu Mamá También" (2001), the fantasy film " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Prisoner of Azkaban" (2004), and science fiction thrillers "Children of Men" (2006) and "Gravity" (2013).
Cuarón is the first Mexican director to win an Academy Award for Best Directing.
Most of his work has been praised by both audiences and critics, and has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay for "Y Tu Mamá También", and both Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing for "Children of Men".
For "Gravity",  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  received several major accolades for his achievement in direction, winning in the respective categories at the Academy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, the BAFTA Awards and the Directors Guild of America; and in addition winning the BAFTA Award Best British Film and the Academy Award for Best Film Editing (shared with  <START:person> Mark Sanger <END> ).
He has also been awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Film not in the English Language as one of the producers of "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006).
In his films,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  is known for his ground-breaking use in the technique of continuous uninterrupted shots.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's brother  <START:person> Carlos <END> , as well as his son  <START:person> Jonás <END> , are also writers and directors and have both acted as co-writers in some of his works.
He is also friends with fellow Mexican directors  <START:person> Guillermo del Toro <END>  and  <START:person> Alejandro González Iñárritu <END> , collectively known as "The Three Amigos of Cinema."
Early life.
 <START:person> Alfonso Cuarón <END>  was born in Mexico City, and is the son of  <START:person> Alfredo Cuarón <END> , a nuclear physicist who worked for the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency for many years.
He has two brothers,  <START:person> Carlos <END> , also a filmmaker, and  <START:person> Alfredo <END> , a conservation biologist.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  studied Philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC (Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos), a school within the same University.
There, he met director  <START:person> Carlos Marcovich <END>  and cinematographer  <START:person> Emmanuel Lubezki <END> , and they made what would be his first short film, "Vengeance Is Mine".
Career.
Cuarón began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director.
His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions including "" and "Romero", and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.
On January 12, 2014,  <START:person> Alfonso <END>  accepted the Golden Globe Award in the category Best Director for Gravity (The 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards, 2014).
He also won two Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Directing.
"Sólo con tu pareja".
"Sólo con tu pareja" was a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by  <START:person> Daniel Giménez Cacho <END> ) who, after spurning an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted AIDS.
In addition to writing, producing and directing,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  co-edited the film with  <START:person> Luis Patlán <END> .
It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the Coen Brothers and  <START:person> Robert Rodriguez <END>  have both directed and edited nearly all of their films.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.
The film, which also starred cabaret singer  <START:person> Astrid Hadad <END>  and model/actress  <START:person> Claudia Ramírez <END>  (with whom  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico.
After this success, director  <START:person> Sydney Pollack <END>  hired  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  to direct an episode of "Fallen Angels", a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included  <START:person> Steven Soderbergh <END> ,  <START:person> Jonathan Kaplan <END> ,  <START:person> Peter Bogdanovich <END>  and  <START:person> Tom Hanks <END> .
International success.
In 1995,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  released his first feature film produced in the United States, "A Little Princess", an adaptation of  <START:person> Frances Hodgson Burnett <END> 's classic novel.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of  <START:person> Charles Dickens <END> 's "Great Expectations" starring  <START:person> Ethan Hawke <END> , Gwyneth Paltrow and  <START:person> Robert De Niro <END> .
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film "Y Tu Mamá También", starring  <START:person> Gael García Bernal <END> ,  <START:person> Diego Luna <END>  and  <START:person> Maribel Verdú <END> .
It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman in her late twenties.
The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  shared an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay with co-writer and brother  <START:person> Carlos Cuarón <END> .
In 2003,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  directed the third film in the successful "Harry Potter" series, " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  faced criticism from some of the more purist " <START:person> Harry Potter <END> " fans for his approach to the film.
At the time of the movie's release, however, author  <START:person> J. K. Rowling <END> , who had seen and loved  <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's film "Y Tu Mamá También", said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.
Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking that it was the first "Harry Potter" film to truly capture the essence of the novels.
It remained as the most critically acclaimed film of the "Harry Potter" film franchise until the release of " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's feature "Children of Men", an adaptation of the  <START:person> P. D. James <END>  novel starring  <START:person> Clive Owen <END> ,  <START:person> Julianne Moore <END>  and  <START:person> Michael Caine <END> , received wide critical acclaim, including three Academy Award nominations.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  himself received two nominations for his work on the film in Best Film Editing (with  <START:person> Alex Rodríguez <END> ) and Best Adapted Screenplay (with several collaborators).
He created the production and distribution company Esperanto Filmoj ("Esperanto Films", named because of his support for the international language Esperanto), which has credits in the films "Duck Season", "Pan's Labyrinth", and "Gravity".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  also directed the controversial public service announcement "I Am Autism" for Autism Speaks that was sharply criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.
In 2010,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  began to develop the film "Gravity", a drama set in space.
He was joined by producer  <START:person> David Heyman <END> , with whom  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  worked on " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
Starring  <START:person> Sandra Bullock <END>  and  <START:person> George Clooney <END> , the film was released in the fall of 2013 and opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival in August.
The film received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Directing.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  won for Best Directing, becoming the first Latin American to win the award, while he and  <START:person> Mark Sanger <END>  shared the award for Best Film Editing.
In 2013,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  created "Believe", a science fiction/fantasy/adventure series that is being broadcast as part of the 2013–14 United States network television schedule on NBC as a mid-season entry.
The series was created by Cuarón for Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television.
In 2014, "TIME" placed him in its list of "100 Most Influential People in the World" Pioneers.
In May 2015  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  was announced as the President of the Jury for the 72nd Venice International Film Festival.
Personal life.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  has been living in London since 2000.
He was married to Italian actress and freelance journalist  <START:person> Annalisa Bugliani <END>  from 2001 to 2008.
They have two children: daughter  <START:person> Tess Bu Cuarón <END>  (born 2003) and son  <START:person> Olmo Teodoro Cuarón <END>  (born 2005).
Anisotropy  Anisotropy is the property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to isotropy, which implies identical properties in all directions.
It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc.)
An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a polarizer.
Another is wood, which is easier to split along its grain than against it.
Fields of interest.
Computer graphics.
In the field of computer graphics, an anisotropic surface changes in appearance as it rotates about its geometric normal, as is the case with velvet.
Anisotropic filtering (AF) is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view.
Older techniques, such as bilinear and trilinear filtering, do not take into account the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in aliasing or blurring of textures.
By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.
Chemistry.
A chemical anisotropic filter, as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the proximal regions filter out larger particles and distal regions increasingly remove smaller particles, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.
In NMR spectroscopy, the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their chemical shift.
In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of benzene.
This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.
In fluorescence spectroscopy, the fluorescence anisotropy, calculated from the polarization properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane-polarized light, is used, e.g., to determine the shape of a macromolecule.
Anisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon.
Real-world imagery.
Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).
Physics.
Physicists from University of California, Berkeley reported about their detection of the cosine anisotropy in cosmic microwave background radiation in 1977.
Their experiment demonstrated the Doppler shift caused by the movement of the earth with respect to the early Universe matter, the source of the radiation.
Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies' rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.
Physicists use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials.
Magnetic anisotropy, for example, may occur in a plasma, so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction.
Plasmas may also show "filamentation" (such as that seen in lightning or a plasma globe) that is directional.
An "anisotropic liquid" has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or chloroform, which contain no structural ordering of the molecules.
Liquid crystals are examples of anisotropic liquids.
Some materials conduct heat in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source.
Heat conduction is more commonly anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required.
The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in electronics are often anisotropic.
Many crystals are anisotropic to light ("optical anisotropy"), and exhibit properties such as birefringence.
Crystal optics describes light propagation in these media.
An "axis of anisotropy" is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken (or an axis of symmetry, such as normal to crystalline layers).
Some materials can have multiple such optical axes.
Geology and geophysics.
Seismic anisotropy is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction.
Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic wavelength (e.g., crystals, cracks, pores, layers or inclusions) have a dominant alignment.
This alignment leads to a directional variation of elasticity wavespeed.
Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's crust, mantle and inner core.
Geological formations with distinct layers of sedimentary material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; electrical conductivity in one direction (e.g.
parallel to a layer), is different from that in another (e.g.
perpendicular to a layer).
This property is used in the gas and oil exploration industry to identify hydrocarbon-bearing sands in sequences of sand and shale.
Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high resistivity (low conductivity), whereas shales have lower resistivity.
Formation evaluation instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas in wells.
The hydraulic conductivity of aquifers is often anisotropic for the same reason.
When calculating groundwater flow to drains or to wells, the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability must be taken into account, otherwise the results may be subject to error.
Most common rock-forming minerals are anisotropic, including quartz and feldspar.
Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their optical properties.
An example of an isotropic mineral is garnet.
Medical acoustics.
Anisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting echogenicity of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed.
Tendon fibers appear hyperechoic (bright) when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon, but can appear hypoechoic (darker) when the transducer is angled obliquely.
This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners.
Material science and engineering.
Anisotropy, in Material Science, is a material’s directional dependence of a physical property.
Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior.
An example would be the dependence of  <START:person> Young <END> 's modulus on the direction of load.
Anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can also be due to certain texture patterns often produced during manufacturing of the material.
In the case of rolling, "stringers" of texture are produced in the direction of rolling, which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions.
Some materials, such as wood and fibre-reinforced composites are very anisotropic, being much stronger along the grain/fibre than across it.
Metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic, though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour.
This is especially important in processes such as deep-drawing.
Wood is a naturally anisotropic (transversely isotropic) material.
Its properties vary widely when measured with or against the growth grain.
For example, wood's strength and hardness is different for the same sample measured in different orientations.
Microfabrication.
Anisotropic etching techniques (such as deep reactive ion etching) are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high aspect ratio.
These features are commonly used in MEMS and microfluidic devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device.
Anisotropic etching can also refer to certain chemical etchants used to etch a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes (e.g., KOH etching of silicon [100] produces pyramid-like structures) Neuroscience.
Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that involves measuring the fractional anisotropy of the random motion (Brownian motion) of water molecules in the brain.
Water molecules located in fiber tracts are more likely to be anisotropic, since they are restricted in their movement (they move more in the dimension parallel to the fiber tract rather than in the two dimensions orthogonal to it), whereas water molecules dispersed in the rest of the brain have less restricted movement and therefore display more isotropy.
This difference in fractional anisotropy is exploited to create a map of the fiber tracts in the brains of the individual.
Atmospheric Radiative Transfer.
Radiance fields (see BRDF) from a reflective surface are often not isotropic in nature.
This makes calculations of the total energy being reflected from any scene a difficult quantity to calculate.
In remote sensing applications, anisotropy functions can be derived for specific scenes, immensely simplifying the calculation of the net reflectance or (thereby) the net irradiance of a scene.
For example, let the BRDF be formula_1 where 'i' denotes incident direction and 'v' denotes viewing direction (as if from a satellite or other instrument).
And let P be the Planar Albedo, which represents the total reflectance from the scene.
It is of interest because, with knowledge of the anisotropy function as defined, a measurement of the BRDF from a single viewing direction (say, formula_4) yields a measure of the total scene reflectance ( <START:person> Planar Albedo <END> ) for that specific incident geometry (say,formula_5).
Abalone  Abalone ( or ; via Spanish "abulón", from the Rumsen language "aulón") is a common name for any of a group of small to very large edible sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Haliotidae.
Other common names are ear shells, sea ears, and muttonfish or muttonshells in Australia, ormer in Great Britain, and pāua in New Zealand.
The family Haliotidae contains only one genus, "Haliotis", which used to contain 6 subgenera.
These subgenera have become alternate representations of "Haliotis".
The number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30 and 130 with over 230 species-level taxa described.
The most comprehensive treatment of the family considers 56 species valid, with 18 additional subspecies.
The shells of abalones have a low open spiral structure, and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shell's outer edge.
The thick inner layer of the shell is composed of nacre (mother-of-pearl), which in many species is highly iridescent, giving rise to a range of strong changeable colors, which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects, jewelry, and as a source of colorful mother-of-pearl.
The flesh of abalones is widely considered to be a desirable food, and is consumed raw or cooked in a variety of cultures.
Description.
The shell of abalones is convex, rounded to oval shape, and may be highly arched or very flattened.
The shell of the majority of species is ear-shaped, presenting a small flat spire and two to three whorls.
The last whorl, known as the body whorl, is auriform, meaning that the shell resembles an ear, giving rise to the common name "ear shell".
"Haliotis asinina" has a somewhat different shape, as it is more elongated and distended.
The shell of "Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii" is also unusual as it has an ovate form, is imperforate, shows an exserted spire, and has prickly ribs.
A mantle cleft in the shell impresses a groove in the shell, in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus.
These holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column.
They make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows.
This series of 8 to 38 holes is near the anterior margin.
Only a small number are generally open.
The older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form.
Each species has a typical number of open holes, between four and ten, in the selenizone.
Abalone have no operculum.
The aperture of the shell is very wide and nacreous.
The exterior of the shell is striated and dull.
The color of the shell is very variable from species to species which may reflect the animal's diet.
The iridescent nacre that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white, to pink, red and green-red to deep blue, green to purple.
The animal shows fimbriated head-lobes.
The side-lobes are also fimbriated and cirrated.
The rounded foot is very large.
The radula has small median teeth, and the lateral teeth are single and beam-like.
There are about 70 uncini, with denticulated hooks, the first four very large.
The soft body is coiled around the columellar muscle, and its insertion, instead of being on the columella, is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell.
The gills are symmetrical and both well developed.
These snails cling solidly with their broad muscular foot to rocky surfaces at sublittoral depths, although some species such as "Haliotis cracherodii" used to be common in the intertidal zone.
Abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size.
Their fecundity is high and increases with their size (from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time).
The spermatozoa are filiform and pointed at one end, and the anterior end is a rounded head.
The larvae are lecithotrophic.
The adults are herbivorous and feed with their rhipidoglossan radula on macroalgae, preferring red or brown algae.
Sizes vary from 20 mm ("Haliotis pulcherrima") to 200 mm while "Haliotis rufescens" is the largest of the genus at 12 in.
Abalones are herbivorous on hard substrata.
By weight, approximately 1/3 of the animal is edible meat, 1/3 is offal, and 1/3 is shell.
Distribution.
The haliotid family has a worldwide distribution, along the coastal waters of every continent, except the Pacific coast of South America, the East Coast of the United States, the Arctic, and Antarctica The majority of abalone species are found in cold waters, such as off the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Western North America, and Japan.
Structure and properties of the shell.
The shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic calcium carbonate tiles stacked like bricks.
Between the layers of tiles is a clingy protein substance.
When the abalone shell is struck, the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow.
Material scientists around the world are studying this tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as body armor.
The dust created by grinding and cutting abalone shell is dangerous; appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles.
Diseases and pests.
Abalones are subject to various diseases.
The Victorian Department of Primary Industries said in 2007 that ganglioneuritis, or AVG, killed up to 90% of stock in affected regions.
Abalone are also severe hemophiliacs as their fluids will not clot in the case of a laceration or puncture wound.
Members of the Spionidae family of the polychaetes are known as pests of abalone.
Human use.
The meat (foot muscle) of abalone is used for food, and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as a source of mother of pearl for jewelry, buttons, buckles, and inlay.
Abalone shells have been found in archaeological sites around the world, ranging from 75,000 year old deposits at Blombos Cave in South Africa to historic Chinese abalone middens on California's Northern Channel Islands.
On the Channel Islands, where abalones were harvested by Native Americans for at least 12,000 years, the size of red abalone shells found in middens declines significantly after about 4000 years ago, probably due to human predation.
Worldwide, abalone pearls have also been collected for centuries.
Farming.
Farming of abalone began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Japan and China.
Since the mid-1990s, there have been many increasingly successful endeavors to commercially farm abalone for the purpose of consumption.
Over-fishing and poaching have reduced wild populations to such an extent that farmed abalone now supplies most of the abalone meat consumed.
The principal abalone farming regions are China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea.
Abalone is also farmed in Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States.
Consumption.
Abalone have long been a valuable food source for humans in every area of the world where a species is abundant.
The meat of this mollusc is considered a delicacy in certain parts of Latin America (especially Chile), France, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and East Asia (especially in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea).
In Chinese speaking regions, abalone are commonly known as bao yu, and sometimes form part of a Chinese banquet .
In the same way as shark fin soup or bird's nest soup, abalone is considered a luxury item, and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations .
However, the availability of commercially farmed abalone has allowed more common consumption of this once rare delicacy .
Abalone started to become popular after the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1915.
As Abalone became more popular and less common, the prices have adjusted accordingly.
In the 1920s a restaurant served portion of abalone, about 4 ounces, would cost (in inflation adjusted dollars) about $7, by 2004, the price had skyrocketed to $75.
In America, prior to this time, abalone was predominantly eaten, gathered, and prepared, by Chinese immigrants.
By 1900, laws were passed in California to outlaw the taking of abalone above the intertidal zone.
This forced the Chinese out of the market and the Japanese perfected diving, with or without gear, to enter the market.
By the time of the exposition, Americans were starting to discover abalone.
The popularity of abalone, along with many other fish and shellfish, increased as the expo exhibited 365 varieties of fish with cooking demonstrations, and a 1300-seat dining hall.
In Japan, live and raw abalone are used in awabi sushi, or served steamed, salted, boiled, chopped, or simmered in soy sauce.
Salted, fermented abalone entrails are the main component of tottsuru, a local dish from Honshū.
Tottsuru is mainly enjoyed with sake.
In California, abalone meat can be found on pizza, sautéed with caramelized mango or in steak form dusted with cracker meal and flour.
Sport harvesting.
Australia.
Tasmania supplies approximately 25% of the yearly world abalone harvest.
Around 12,500 Tasmanians recreationally fish for blacklip and greenlip abalone.
For blacklip abalone, the size limit varies from between 138 mm for the southern end of the state and 127 mm for the northern end of the state.
Greenlip abalone have a minimum size of 145 mm, except for an area around  <START:person> Perkin <END> 's Bay in the north of the state where the minimum size is 132 mm.
With a recreational abalone licence, there is a bag limit of 10 per day, and a total possession limit of 20.
Scuba diving for abalone is allowed, and has a rich history in Australia.
(Scuba diving for abalone in the states of New South Wales and Western Australia is illegal; a free-diving catch limit of two is allowed).
 <START:person> Victoria <END>  has had an active abalone fishery since the late 1950s.
The state is sectioned into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western with each fisher required a zone allocated licence.
Harvesting is performed by divers using surface supplied air "hookah" systems operating from runabout style, outboard powered boats.
While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds the deckhand operates the boat, known as working "live" and stays above where the diver is working.
Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of "shot line", where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved.
Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand re-measures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell.
Since 2002 the Victorian Industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch (TAC) reduced from 1440 tonnes to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 fishing year.
This is due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus Ganglioneuritis which is fast spreading and lethal to abalone stocks.
United States.
Sport harvesting of red abalone is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card.
In 2008, the abalone card also came with a set of 24 tags.
This was reduced to 18 abalone per year in 2014, only nine of which may be taken south of Mendocino County.
Legal-size abalone must be tagged immediately.
Abalone may only be taken using breath-hold techniques or shorepicking; scuba diving for abalone is strictly prohibited.
Taking of abalone is not permitted south of the mouth of the San Francisco Bay.
There is a size minimum of 7 in measured across the shell.
A person may be in possession of only three abalone at any given time.
Abalone may only be taken from April to November, not including July.
Transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still attached in the shell.
Sale of sport-obtained abalone is illegal, including the shell.
Only red abalone may be taken as black, white, pink, flat, green, and pinto abalone are protected by law.
An abalone diver is normally equipped with a thick wetsuit, including a hood, bootees, and gloves, and usually also a mask, snorkel, weight belt, abalone iron, and abalone gauge.
Alternatively, the rock picker can feel underneath rocks at low tides for abalone.
Abalone are mostly taken in depths from a few inches up to 10 m; less common are freedivers who can work deeper than 10 m.
Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources such as kelp.
An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it can fully clamp down.
Divers dive out of boats, kayaks, tube floats or directly off the shore.
The largest abalone recorded in California is 12.34 in, caught by  <START:person> John Pepper <END>  somewhere off the coast of San Mateo county in September 1993.
The mollusc "Concholepas concholepas" is often sold in the United States under the name "Chilean abalone", though it is not an abalone, but a muricid.
New Zealand.
In New Zealand, abalone is called pāua (, from the Māori language).
"Haliotis iris" (or blackfoot pāua) is the ubiquitous New Zealand pāua; the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue, green, and purple iridescence.
"Haliotis australis" and "Haliotis virginea" are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than "H.
iris".
Like all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of pāua does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) are followed.
The legal recreational daily limit is 10 pāua per diver, with a minimum shell length of 125 mm for "Haliotis iris" and 80 mm for "Haliotis australis".
In addition, no person may be in possession, even on land, of more than 20 pāua or more than 2.5 kg of pāua meat at any one time.
Pāua can only be caught by free-diving; it is illegal to catch pāua using scuba gear.
There is an extensive global black market in collecting and exporting abalone meat.
This can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest pāua can be granted legally under Māori customary rights.
When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police.
The limit is strictly enforced by roving Ministry for Primary Industries fishery officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police.
Pāua poaching is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized.
Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases, imprisonment.
The Ministry of Fisheries expects in the year 2004/05, nearly 1,000 tons of pāua will be poached, with 75% of that being undersized.
South Africa.
The largest abalone in South Africa, "Haliotis midae", occurs along approximately two-thirds of the country’s coastline.
Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting.
In South Africa all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually, and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear.
For the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone, but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by syndicates.
In 2007, because of widespread poaching of abalone, the South African government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the CITES section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species.
This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls.
Export permits are still required, however.
The abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries.
As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram.
There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne.
Channel Islands.
Ormers ("Haliotis tuberculata") are considered a delicacy in the British Channel Islands as well as in adjacent areas of France, and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals.
This has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century, and "ormering" is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks.
The gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from January 1 to April 30, which occur on the full or new moon and two days following.
No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under 80 mm in shell length.
Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater.
Any breach of these laws is a criminal offense and can lead to fine of up to £5,000 or six months in prison.
The demand for ormers is such that they led to the world's first underwater arrest, when Mr.  <START:person> Kempthorne-Leigh <END>  of Guernsey was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear when illegally diving for ormers.
Decorative items.
The highly iridescent inner nacre layer of the shell of abalone has traditionally been used as a decorative item, in jewelry, buttons, and as inlay in furniture and in musical instruments such as guitars, etc. Abalone pearl jewelry is very popular in New Zealand and Australia, in no minor part due to the marketing and farming efforts of pearl companies.
Unlike the Oriental Natural, the Akoya pearl, and the South Sea and Tahitian cultured pearls, abalone pearls are not primarily judged by their roundness.
The inner shell of the abalone is an iridescent swirl of intense colours, ranging from deep cobalt blue and peacock green to purples, creams and pinks.
Therefore each pearl, natural or cultured, will have its own unique collage of colours.
The shells of abalone are occasionally used in New Age smudging ceremonies to catch falling ash.
They have also been used as incense burners.
Threat of extinction.
Abalones have been identified as one of the many classes of organism threatened with extinction due to overfishing, acidification of oceans from anthropogenic carbon dioxide, as reduced pH erodes their shells.
It is predicted that abalones will become extinct in the wild within 200 years at current rates of carbon dioxide production.
Species.
The number of species that are recognized within the genus "Haliotis" has fluctuated over time, and depends on the source that is consulted.
The number of recognized species range from 30 to 130.
This list finds a compromise using the "WoRMS database", plus some species that have been added, for a total of 57.
The majority of abalone have not been rated for conservation status.
Those that have been reviewed tend to show that the abalone in general is an animal that is declining in numbers, and will need protection throughout the globe.

</dl>   <START:person> Ambrose  Aurelius Ambrosius <END> , better known in English as Saint  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  (; c. 340 – 4 April 397), was a bishop of Milan who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century.
He was consular prefect of Liguria and  <START:person> Emilia <END> , headquartered in Milan, before being made bishop of Milan by popular acclamation in 374.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was a staunch opponent of Arianism, and has been accused of fostering persecutions of Arians, Jews, and pagans.
Traditionally,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is credited with promoting "antiphonal chant", a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing "Veni redemptor gentium", a Christmas hymn.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was one of the four original doctors of the Church, and is the patron saint of Milan.
He is notable for his influence on St. Augustine.
Life.
Early life.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was born into a Roman Christian family about 340 AD and was raised in  <START:person> Trier <END> .
His father was  <START:person> Aurelius Ambrosius <END> , the praetorian prefect of  <START:person> Gaul <END> ; his mother was a woman of intellect and piety.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's siblings,  <START:person> Satyrus <END>  (who is the subject of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's "De excessu fratris Satyri") and  <START:person> Marcellina <END> , are also venerated as saints.
There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of bees settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of honey.
His father considered this a sign of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue.
For this reason, bees and beehives often appear in the saint's symbology.
After the early death of his father,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  followed his father's career.
He was educated in Rome, studying literature, law, and rhetoric.
Praetorian prefect  <START:person> Probus <END>  first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him consular prefect or "Governor" of Liguria and  <START:person> Emilia <END> , with headquarters at Milan, which was then (beside Rome) the second capital in Italy.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374 when he became the Bishop of Milan.
He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of the Emperor  <START:person> Valentinian I. Ambrose <END>  never married.
Bishop of Milan.
In the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the diocese of Milan between the Catholics and Arians.
In 374 the bishop of Milan,  <START:person> Auxentius <END> , an  <START:person> Arian <END> , died, and the  <START:person> Arians <END>  challenged the succession.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis.
His address was interrupted by a call "Ambrose, bishop!", which was taken up by the whole assembly.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was known to be Catholic in belief, but also acceptable to  <START:person> Arians <END>  due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard.
At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared:  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was neither baptized nor formally trained in theology.
Upon his appointment,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide.
Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor  <START:person> Gratian <END>  praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions,  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's host gave him up.
Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of Milan.
As bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister  <START:person> Marcellina <END>  (who later became a nun), and committed the care of his family to his brother.
This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also wrote a treatise by the name of "The Goodness of Death".
Arianism.
According to legend,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  immediately and forcefully stopped Arianism in Milan.
He studied theology with Simplician, a presbyter of Rome.
Using his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, to his advantage, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like  <START:person> Philo <END> , Origen,  <START:person> Athanasius <END> , and Basil of Caesarea, with whom he was also exchanging letters.
He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed  <START:person> Augustine of Hippo <END> , who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.
In the confrontation with  <START:person> Arians <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the Nicene creed and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy.
The  <START:person> Arians <END>  appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires.
Although the western Emperor  <START:person> Gratian <END>  supported orthodoxy, the younger  <START:person> Valentinian II <END> , who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  did not sway the young prince's position.
In the East, Emperor  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  I likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy.
In this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops Palladius of Ratiaria and Secundianus of Singidunum, confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire.
This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation.
However,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops.
Accordingly, a synod composed of thirty-two bishops was held at Aquileia in the year 381.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined.
A vote was then taken, when  <START:person> Palladius <END>  and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.
Nevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose.
In 385 or 386 the emperor and his mother  <START:person> Justina <END> , along with a considerable number of clergy and laity, especially military, professed Arianism.
They demanded two churches in Milan, one in the city (the Basilica of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), to the Arians.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.
He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches.
The day following, when he was performing divine service in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs.
As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of Easter.
In spite of Imperial opposition, Bishop  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  declared: If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of  <START:person> Christ <END> .
I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it.
The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but God alone can appease it.
Imperial relations.
The imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> , however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor.
When  <START:person> Magnus Maximus <END>  usurped the supreme power in Gaul, and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.
A second later embassy was unsuccessful.
The enemy entered Italy and Milan was taken.
 <START:person> Justina <END>  and her son fled but  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.
In 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused Valentinian II's imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the use of Arian troops.
In 386  <START:person> Justina <END>  and Valentinian received the  <START:person> Arian <END>  bishop  <START:person> Auxentius <END>  the younger, and  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.
Theodosius I, the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of  <START:person> Justina <END> , and regained the kingdom.
 <START:person> Theodosius <END>  was excommunicated by  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  for the massacre of 7,000 persons at Thessalonica in 390, after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  told  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  to imitate  <START:person> David <END>  in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt —  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also forced Theodosius to retreat from compensating a Jewish community in Mesopotamia when a synagogue was burnt down by militant Christians.
These incidents show the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor — the controversy of  <START:person> John Chrysostom <END>  with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.
In 392, after the death of Valentinian II and the acclamation of  <START:person> Eugenius <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  after  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  was eventually victorious.
Attitude towards Jews.
In his treatise on  <START:person> Abraham <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  warns against intermarriage with pagans, Jews, or heretics.
In 388, Emperor  <START:person> Theodosius the Great <END>  was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the synagogue at Callinicum on the Euphrates.
He ordered the synagogue rebuilt at the expense of the bishop.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  wrote to him, pointing out that he was thereby "exposing the bishop to the danger of either acting against the truth or of death"; in the letter "the reasons given for the imperial rescript are met, especially by the plea that the Jews had burnt many churches".
In the course of the letter  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  speaks of the clemency that the emperor had shown with regard to the burning of other buildings and then adds: "There is, then, no adequate cause for such a commotion, that the people should be so severely punished for the burning of a building, and much less since it is the burning of a synagogue, a home of unbelief, a house of impiety, a receptacle of folly, which God Himself has condemned.
For thus we read, where the Lord our God speaks by the mouth of the prophet  <START:person> Jeremiah <END> : 'And I will do to this house, which is called by My Name, wherein ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh, and I will cast you forth from My sight, as I cast forth your brethren, the whole seed of  <START:person> Ephraim <END> .
And do not thou pray for that people, and do not thou ask mercy for them, and do not come near Me on their behalf, for I will not hear thee.
Or seest thou not what they do in the cities of  <START:person> Judah <END> ?' God forbids intercession to be made for those."
In his exposition of Psalm 1,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  says: "Virtues without faith are leaves, flourishing in appearance, but unproductive.
How many pagans have mercy and sobriety but no fruit, because they do not attain their purpose!
The leaves speedily fall at the wind's breath.
Some Jews exhibit purity of life and much diligence and love of study, but bear no fruit and live like leaves."
Attitude towards pagans.
Under  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's major influence, emperors Gratian, Valentinian II and Theodosius I carried on a persecution of Paganism.
Under  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's influence,  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  issued the 391 "Theodosian decrees," which with increasing intensity outlawed  <START:person> Pagan <END>  practises, and the Altar of Victory was removed by  <START:person> Gratian <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  prevailed upon Gratian, Valentinian and  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  to reject requests to restore the Altar.
Later years and death.
In April 393  <START:person> Arbogast <END> , "magister militum" of the West and his puppet Emperor  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  marched into Italy to consolidate their position in regard to Theodosius I and his son,  <START:person> Honorius <END> , whom  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  had appointed Augustus to govern the western portion of the empire.
 <START:person> Arbogast <END>  and  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  courted  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's support by very obliging letters; but before they arrived at Milan, he had retired to Bologna, where he assisted at the translation of the relics of SS.
 <START:person> Vitalis <END>  and Agricola.
From there he went to Florence, where he remained until  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  withdrew from Milan to meet Theodosius in the Battle of the Frigidus in early September 394.
Soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the Roman empire,  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  died at Milan in 395, and two years later (April 4, 397)  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also died.
He was succeeded as bishop of Milan by  <START:person> Simplician <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's body may still be viewed in the church of S. Ambrogio in Milan, where it has been continuously venerated — along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of Sts.
 <START:person> Gervase <END>  and Protase.
Character.
Many circumstances in the history of  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  are characteristic of the general spirit of the times.
The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period.
But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.
He was generous to the poor; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship.
It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two martyrs,  <START:person> Gervasius <END>  and Protasius.
The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died.
The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.
Theology.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  ranks with  <START:person> Augustine <END> ,  <START:person> Jerome <END> , and  <START:person> Gregory the Great <END> , as one of the Latin Doctors of the Church.
Theologians compare him with  <START:person> Hilary <END> , who they claim fell short of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's administrative excellence but demonstrated greater theological ability.
He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of Biblical and doctrinal subjects.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing doctrine of the Church and its sacerdotal ministry, while the prevalent asceticism of the day, continuing the Stoic and Ciceronian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian ethics.
Thus we have the "De officiis ministrorum", "De viduis", "De virginitate" and "De paenitentia".
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place.
His advice to  <START:person> Augustine <END>  of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom.
"When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not.
Follow the custom of the church where you are."
Thus  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the "right" liturgical form where there was no substantial problem.
His advice has remained in the English language as the saying, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
One interpretation of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's writings is that he was a Christian universalist.
It has been noted that  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's theology was significantly influenced by that of Origen and  <START:person> Didymus the Blind <END> , two other early Christian universalists.
One quotation cited in favor of this belief: Our Savior has appointed two kinds of resurrection in the Apocalypse.
'Blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection,' for such come to grace without the judgment.
As for those who do not come to the first, but are reserved unto the second resurrection, these shall be disciplined until their appointed times, between the first and the second resurrection.
One could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream Christian belief in a general resurrection (both for those in heaven and for those in hell).
Several other works by  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation.
For example: The Jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into God, "and therefore have lost the grace of redemption", because they reject that on which salvation depends.
Giving to the poor.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders, but a part of the united, solidary people.
Giving to the poor was not to be considered an act of generosity towards the fringes of society but as a repayment of resources that God had originally bestowed on everyone equally and that the rich had usurped.
Mariology.
The theological treatises of Ambrose of Milan would come to influence  <START:person> Popes Damasus <END> ,  <START:person> Siricius <END>  and  <START:person> Leo XIII <END> .
Central to  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is the virginity of  <START:person> Mary <END>  and her role as  <START:person> Mother of God <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  viewed virginity as superior to marriage and saw  <START:person> Mary <END>  as the model of virginity.
Writings.
In matters of exegesis he is, like  <START:person> Hilary <END> , an Alexandrian.
In dogma he follows Basil of Caesarea and other Greek authors, but nevertheless gives a distinctly Western cast to the speculations of which he treats.
This is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human sin and divine grace, and in the place which he assigns to faith in the individual Christian life.
Church music.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of Ambrosian chant also known simply as "antiphonal chant", a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other.
(The later pope St.  <START:person> Gregory <END>  I the Great is not known to have composed any Gregorian chant, the plainsong or "Romish chant".)
However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing hymnody from the Eastern Church into the West.
Catching the impulse from  <START:person> Hilary <END>  and confirmed in it by the success of Arian psalmody,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  composed several original hymns as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies.
Each of these hymns has eight four-line stanzas and is written in strict iambic dimeter (that is 2 x 2 iambs).
Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.
In his writings,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refers only to the performance of psalms, in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an "antiphon".
 <START:person> St. Ambrose <END>  was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn "Te Deum", which he is said to have composed when he baptised St. Augustine of Hippo, his celebrated convert.
Augustine.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was Bishop of Milan at the time of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's conversion, and is mentioned in  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions".
Celibacy.
In a passage of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions" in which  <START:person> Augustine <END>  wonders why he could not share his burden with  <START:person> Ambrose <END> , he makes a comment which bears on the history of celibacy:  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor.
Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden.
Reading.
In this same passage of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions" is a curious anecdote which bears on the history of reading: When [ <START:person> Ambrose <END> ] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still.
Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud.
This is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion.
The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become.
In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection.
However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual.
In popular culture.
In the 2012 film "", Bishop  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is portrayed by Italian actor  <START:person> Andrea Giordana <END> .
Bibliography.
Latin English translations Several of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's works have recently been published in the bilingual Latin-German Fontes Christiani series (currently edited by Brepols).
Several religious brotherhoods which have sprung up in and around Milan at various times since the 14th century have been called Ambrosians.
Their connection to  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is tenuous  Adiabatic process  An adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or matter between a system and its surroundings.
The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics, and as such it is a key concept in thermodynamics.
Some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the "adiabatic approximation," meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system.
In way of example, the adiabatic flame temperature is an idealization that uses the "adiabatic approximation" so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel.
The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by a flame if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings.
Description.
A process that does not involve the transfer of heat or matter into or out of a system, so that "Q" = 0, is called an adiabatic process, and such a system is said to be adiabatically isolated.
The assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption.
For example, the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process, little of the system's energy can be transferred out as heat.
Even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive, that process is idealized to be adiabatic.
The assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one, and is often combined with others so as to make the calculation of the system's behaviour possible.
Such assumptions are idealizations.
The behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations, but the assumption of such "perfect" behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works.
Various applications of the adiabatic assumption.
Naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).
The transfer of energy as work into an adiabatic (insulated) system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds.
One kind of work is where there is no entropy produced within the system (no friction, viscous dissipation, etc), and the work is only pressure-volume work (denoted by "P" d"V").
In nature, this ideal kind occurs only approximately, because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation.
The other extreme kind of work is isochoric work (), for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system.
A stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid, but that work is not recoverable.
Isochoric work is irreversible.
The second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process of transfer of energy as work, always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work.
Every natural process, adiabatic or not, is irreversible, with Δ"S" > 0, as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent.
Adiabatic heating and cooling.
The adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas.
Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature.
In contrast, free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas.
Adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a piston compressing a gas contained within an adiabatic cylinder.
This finds practical application in Diesel engines which rely on the lack of quick heat dissipation during their compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.
Adiabatic heating occurs in the Earth's atmosphere when an air mass descends, for example, in a katabatic wind, Foehn wind, or chinook wind flowing downhill over a mountain range.
When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases.
Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing the internal energy.
The parcel of air is unable to dissipate energy as heat, hence it is considered adiabatically isolated, and its temperature will rise sensibly.
Adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings.
When the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as internal energy decreases.
Adiabatic cooling occurs in the Earth's atmosphere with orographic lifting and lee waves, and this can form pileus or lenticular clouds.
Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid.
One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is adiabatic demagnetisation, where the change in magnetic field on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling.
Also, the contents of an expanding universe can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid.
"(See Heat death of the universe)" Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as kimberlites.
Such temperature changes can be quantified using the ideal gas law, or the hydrostatic equation for atmospheric processes.
In practice, no process is truly adiabatic.
Many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary, and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption.
There is always some heat loss, as no perfect insulators exist.
Ideal gas (reversible process).
The mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process is where "P" is pressure, "V" is volume, and formula_3 being the specific heat for constant pressure, formula_4 being the specific heat for constant volume, formula_5 is the adiabatic index, and formula_6 is the number of degrees of freedom (3 for monatomic gas, 5 for diatomic gas and collinear molecules e.g.
carbon dioxide).
For a monatomic ideal gas, formula_7, and for a diatomic gas (such as nitrogen and oxygen, the main components of air) formula_8.
Note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not Bose– <START:person> Einstein <END>  or Fermi gases.
For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that where "T" is an absolute temperature.
This can also be written as Example of adiabatic compression.
Let's now look at a common example of adiabatic compression–the compression stroke in a gasoline engine.
We will make a few simplifying assumptions: that the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is 1000 cm3 (one litre), that the gas within is nearly pure nitrogen (thus a diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so formula_12 = 7/5), and that the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1000 cm3 volume of uncompressed gas will compress down to 100 cm3 when the piston goes from bottom to top).
The uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27 ºC or 300 K, and a pressure of 1 bar ~ 100 kPa, or about 14.7 PSI, i.e. typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).
formula_13 so our adiabatic constant for this experiment is about 1.58 billion.
The gas is now compressed to a 100 cm3 volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas).
The new volume is 100 cm3, but the constant for this experiment is still 1.58 billion: formula_14 so solving for P: formula_15 or about 362 PSI or 24.5 atm.
Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas has also heated the gas and the hotter gas will have a greater pressure even if the volume had not changed.
We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law.
Our initial conditions are 100,000 pa of pressure, 1000 cm3 volume, and 300 K of temperature, so our experimental constant is: formula_16 That is a final temperature of 751 K, or 477 °C, or 892 °F, well above the ignition point of many fuels.
This is why a high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause engine knocking when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a supercharger and intercooler to provide a lower temperature at the same pressure would be advantageous.
A diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature which ensures immediate ignition of injected fuel.
Adiabatic free expansion of a gas.
For an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum.
Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero.
Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero.
For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case.
Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.
Derivation of P-V relation for adiabatic heating and cooling.
The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, formula_17.
Then, according to the first law of thermodynamics, where "dU" is the change in the internal energy of the system and "δW" is work done "by" the system.
Any work ("δW") done must be done at the expense of internal energy "U", since no heat "δQ" is being supplied from the surroundings.
Pressure-volume work "δW" done "by" the system is defined as However, "P" does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with "V".
It is desired to know how the values of "dP" and "dV" relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds.
For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by where formula_21 is the number of degrees of freedom divided by two, "R" is the universal gas constant and "n" is the number of moles in the system (a constant).
Differentiating Equation (3) and use of the ideal gas law, formula_22, yields Equation (4) is often expressed as formula_24 because formula_25.
Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain factorize :formula_27: and divide both sides by "PV": After integrating the left and right sides from formula_30 to V and from formula_31 to P and changing the sides respectively, Exponentiate both sides, and substitute formula_33 with formula_34, the heat capacity ratio and eliminate the negative sign to obtain Therefore, and Derivation of T-V relation for adiabatic heating and cooling.
Substituting the ideal gas law into the above, we obtain which simplifies to Derivation of discrete formula.
The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to At the same time, the work done by the pressure-volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true By the previous derivation, Rearranging (4) gives Substituting this into (2) gives Integrating, Substituting formula_48, Rearranging, Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases), By the continuous formula, Or, Substituting into the previous expression for formula_54, Substituting this expression and (1) in (3) gives Simplifying, Simplifying, Simplifying, Graphing adiabats.
An adiabat is a curve of constant entropy on the P-V diagram.
Some properties of adiabats on a P-V diagram are indicated.
These properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases, except in the region where "PV" becomes small (low temperature), where quantum effects become important.
The following diagram is a P-V diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms: The isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.
The adiabats are isentropic.
Volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis.
Etymology.
The term "adiabatic", literally means 'not to be passed through'.
It is formed from the ancient Greek privative "α" ("not") + "διαβατός", "able to be passed through", in turn deriving from "διὰ-" ("through"), and "βαῖνειν" ("to walk, go, come"), thus "ἀδιάβατος ".
According to  <START:person> Maxwell <END> , and to  <START:person> Partington <END> , the term was introduced by  <START:person> Rankine <END> .
The etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of transfer of energy as heat and of transfer of matter across the wall.
Divergent usages of the word adiabatic.
This present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics, and the word adiabatic is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics, introduced by  <START:person> Rankine <END> .
It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated.
In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be adiabatic (though often far from isentropic) even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated.
Quantum mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics, however, use the word adiabatic in very a different sense, one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense.
In quantum theory, the word adiabatic can mean something perhaps near isentropic, or perhaps near quasi-static, but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines.
On one hand in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly (that is to say quasi-statically), it is said to have been done adiabatically.
The idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously, so that no quantum jump is triggered, and the change is virtually reversible.
While the occupation numbers are unchanged, nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one-to-one corresponding, pre-and post-compression, eigenstates.
Thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system.
For example,  <START:person> Max Born <END>  writes "Actually, it is usually the 'adiabatic' case with which we have to do: i.e. the limiting case where the external force (or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other) acts very slowly.
In this case, to a very high approximation that is, there is no probability for a transition, and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation.
Such a slow perturbation is therefore reversible, as it is classically."
On the other hand in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly, it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates, as well as changing their shapes.
In that theory, such a rapid change is said not to be 'adiabatic', and the contrary word 'diabatic' is even applied to it.
One might guess that perhaps  <START:person> Clausius <END> , if he were confronted with this, in the now-obsolete language he used in his day, would have said that "internal work" was done and that 'heat was generated though not transferred'.
In classical thermodynamics, such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated, and there is no transfer of energy as heat.
The strong irreversibility of the change, due to viscosity or other entropy production, does not impinge on this classical usage.
Thus for a mass of gas, in macroscopic thermodynamics, words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer, even if the system is not adiabatically isolated.
But in quantum statistical theory, a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid, even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term.
The words are used differently in the two disciplines, as stated just above.
Abbotsford House  Abbotsford is a historic country house in the Scottish Borders, at the town of Galashiels, near Melrose, on the south bank of the River Tweed.
It was formerly the residence of historical novelist and poet,  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  (Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END> ,Bt).
It is a Category A Listed Building.
Description.
The nucleus of the estate was a small farm of 100 acre, called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i.e., muddy) Hole, and was bought by  <START:person> Scott <END>  on the lapse of his lease (1811) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel.
He first built a small villa and named it Abbotsford, creating the name from a ford nearby where previously abbots of Melrose Abbey used to cross the river.
 <START:person> Scott <END>  then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion, building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of Scotland.
In it he gathered a large library, a collection of ancient furniture, arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities, especially connected with Scottish history, notably the Celtic Torrs Pony-cap and Horns and the Woodwrae Stone, all now in the Museum of Scotland.
The last and principal acquisition was that of  <START:person> Toftfield <END>  (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in 1817.
The new house was then begun and completed in 1824.
The general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed; and the style is mainly the Scottish Baronial.
Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the old Tolbooth in Edinburgh.
 <START:person> Scott <END>  had only enjoyed his residence one year when (1825) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt.
In 1830 the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors.
The property was wholly disencumbered in 1847 by  <START:person> Robert Cadell <END> , the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family's share in the copyright of Sir  <START:person> Walter <END> 's works.
 <START:person> Scott <END> 's only son  <START:person> Walter <END>  did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from India in 1847.
Among subsequent possessors were  <START:person> Scott <END> 's son-in-law,  <START:person> John Gibson Lockhart <END> ,  <START:person> J. R. Hope Scott <END> , QC, and his daughter ( <START:person> Scott <END> 's great-granddaughter), the Hon.
Mrs  <START:person> Maxwell Scott <END> .
The house was opened to the public in 1833, but continued to be occupied by  <START:person> Scott <END> 's descendants until 2004.
The last of his direct descendants to inhabit Abbotsford was his great-great-great-granddaughter  <START:person> Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott <END>  (8 June 1923 5 May 2004).
She inherited it from her elder sister  <START:person> Patricia <END>  in 1998.
The sisters turned the house into one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house.
It had electricity installed only in 1962.
 <START:person> Dame Jean <END>  was at one time a lady-in-waiting to Princess  <START:person> Alice <END> , Duchess of Gloucester, patron of the Dandie Dinmont Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END> 's characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir  <START:person> Wattie <END> , ridden by  <START:person> Ian Stark <END> , won two silver medals at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Scottish Borders Council is considering an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the River Tweed from Abbotsford, to which Historic Scotland and the National Trust for Scotland object.
Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  rescued the "jougs" from Threave Castle in Dumfries and  <START:person> Galloway <END>  and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at Abbotsford.
Tweedbank railway station is located near to Abbotsford House.
Miscellaneous.
Abbotsford gave its name to the Abbotsford Club, founded by  <START:person> William Barclay Turnbull <END>  in 1833 or 1834 in  <START:person> Scott <END> 's honour, and a successor to the  <START:person> Bannatyne <END>  and Maitland Clubs.
It was a text publication society, which existed to print and publish historical works connected with  <START:person> Scott <END> 's writings.
Its publications extended from 1835 to 1864.
In keeping with its many  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  references, Rose Street in Edinburgh has a bar called the "Kenilworth", along with one named the "Abbotsford".
In 2012, a new Visitors Centre opened at Abbotsford which houses a small exhibition, Ochiltrees Diner and a gift shop In 2014 it won the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award for its recent conservation project.
 <START:person> Alan Kay  Alan Curtis Kay <END>  (born May 17, 1940) is an American computer scientist.
He has been elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society of Arts.
He is best known for his pioneering work on object-oriented programming and windowing graphical user interface design.
He is the president of the Viewpoints Research Institute, and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.
He is also on the advisory board of TTI/Vanguard.
Until mid-2005, he was a Senior Fellow at HP Labs, a Visiting Professor at Kyoto University, and an Adjunct Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
After 10 years at Xerox PARC,  <START:person> Kay <END>  became Atari's chief scientist for three years.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is also a former professional jazz guitarist, composer, and theatrical designer, and an amateur classical pipe organist.
Early life and work.
In an interview on education in America with the Davis Group Ltd.  <START:person> Alan Kay <END>  said, "I had the fortune or misfortune to learn how to read fluently starting at the age of three.
So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade.
And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me." Originally from Springfield, Massachusetts,  <START:person> Kay <END>  attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, earning a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Molecular Biology.
Before and during this time, he worked as a professional jazz guitarist.
In 1966, he began graduate school at the University of Utah College of Engineering, earning a Master's degree and a Ph.D. degree.
There, he worked with  <START:person> Ivan Sutherland <END> , who had done pioneering graphics programs including Sketchpad.
This greatly inspired  <START:person> Kay <END> 's evolving views on objects and programming.
As he grew busier with ARPA research, he quit his career as a professional musician.
In 1968, he met  <START:person> Seymour Papert <END>  and learned of the Logo programming language, a dialect of Lisp optimized for educational use.
This led him to learn of the work of  <START:person> Jean Piaget <END> ,  <START:person> Jerome Bruner <END> ,  <START:person> Lev Vygotsky <END> , and of constructionist learning.
These further influenced his views.
In 1970,  <START:person> Kay <END>  joined Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, PARC.
In the 1970s he was one of the key members there to develop prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language Smalltalk.
These inventions were later commercialized by Apple Computer in their  <START:person> Lisa <END>  and Macintosh computers.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is one of the fathers of the idea of object-oriented programming, which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC and predecessors at the Norwegian Computing Center.
He conceived the Dynabook concept which defined the conceptual basics for laptop and tablet computers and E-books, and is the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface (GUI).
Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform,  <START:person> Kay <END>  is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning, and indeed, many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the One Laptop Per Child educational platform, with which  <START:person> Kay <END>  is actively involved.
The field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen, according to  <START:person> Kay <END> , in which educational communities, parents, and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by  <START:person> Douglas Engelbart <END> , but a medium in  <START:person> Marshall McLuhan <END>  sense.
He wrote that the destiny of personal computing is not going to be: (...) a 'vehicle', as in Engelbart's metaphor opposed to the IBM 'railroads', but something much more profound: a (...) medium.
With a 'vehicle' one could wait until high school and give 'drivers ed', but if it was a medium, it had to extend into the world of childhood.
Recent work and recognition.
Starting in 1984,  <START:person> Kay <END>  was an Apple Fellow at Apple Computer until the closing of the ATG (Advanced Technology Group), one of the company's R&D divisions.
He then joined  <START:person> Walt Disney Imagineering <END>  as a Disney Fellow and remained there until Disney ended its Disney Fellow program.
After Disney, in 2001 he founded Viewpoints Research Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development.
Later,  <START:person> Kay <END>  worked with a team at Applied Minds, then became a Senior Fellow at Hewlett-Packard until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005.
He is currently head of Viewpoints Institute.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  taught a Fall 2011 class, "Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World", at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) along with full-time ITP faculty member  <START:person> Nancy Hechinger <END> .
The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching/learning based on fundamental, powerful concepts—rather than on traditional rote learning.
Squeak, Etoys, and Croquet.
In December 1995, when he was still at Apple,  <START:person> Kay <END>  collaborated with many others to start the open source Squeak version of Smalltalk, and he continues to work on it.
As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the Etoys system.
More recently he started, along with  <START:person> David A. Smith <END> ,  <START:person> David P. Reed <END> ,  <START:person> Andreas Raab <END> ,  <START:person> Rick McGeer <END> ,  <START:person> Julian Lombardi <END> , and  <START:person> Mark McCahill <END> , the Croquet Project, which is an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.
Tweak.
In 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do.
 <START:person> Andreas Raab <END>  was a researcher working in  <START:person> Kay <END> 's group, then at Hewlett-Packard.
He proposed defining a "script process" and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems.
The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future.
Tweak added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.
Its underlying object system is class-based, but to users (during programming) it acts like it is prototype-based.
Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.
Children's Machine.
In November 2005, at the World Summit on the Information Society, the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world.
It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the One Laptop per Child program, the Children's Machine, and the XO-1.
The program was begun and is sustained by  <START:person> Kay <END> 's friend,  <START:person> Nicholas Negroponte <END> , and is based on  <START:person> Kay <END> 's Dynabook ideal.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.
Reinventing programming.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented.
Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled "The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" were informed by his experiences with Sketchpad, Simula, Smalltalk, and the bloated code of commercial software.
On August 31, 2006,  <START:person> Kay <END> 's proposal to the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) was granted, thus funding Viewpoints Research Institute for several years.
The proposal title was: "STEPS Toward the Reinvention of Programming": A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium.
A sense of what  <START:person> Kay <END>  is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: "The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days.
We wonder: how small could be an understandable practical "Model T" design that covers this functionality?
1M lines of code?
200K LOC? 100K LOC? 20K LOC?" Awards and honors.
 <START:person> Alan Kay <END>  has received many awards and honors.
Among them: Other honors: J-D Warnier Prix d’Informatique, ACM Systems Software Award, NEC Computers & Communication Foundation Prize, Funai Foundation Prize,  <START:person> Lewis Branscomb <END>  Technology Award, ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education.
Assault  In common law, assault is the act of creating apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact with a person.
An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm.
It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability.
Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law.
There is, however, an additional criminal law category of assault consisting of an attempted but unsuccessful battery.
The term is often confused with battery, which involves physical contact.
The specific meaning of assault varies between countries, but can refer to an act that causes another to apprehend immediate and personal violence, or in the more limited sense of a threat of violence caused by an immediate show of force.
Assault in many US jurisdictions and Scotland is defined more broadly still as any intentional physical contact with another person without their consent; but in England and Wales and in most other common law jurisdictions in the world, this is defined instead as battery.
Some jurisdictions have incorporated the definition of civil assault into the definition of the crime making it a criminal assault intentionally to cause another person to apprehend a harmful or offensive contact.
Related definitions.
Battery.
In common law, criminal assault often accompanies battery.
See common assault.
The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.
Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting him is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.
Aggravated assault.
Aggravated assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a deadly weapon.
A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to: Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.
Defenses.
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault: Consent.
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as de minimis harm.
Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.
Consent may be a complete or partial defense to assault.
In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.
This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual sadomasochistic sexual activity, the most notable case being the Operation Spanner case.
Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game (Mixed martial arts, wrestling, boxing, or contact sports), bodily adornment (R v Wilson), or horseplay ( <START:person> Jones <END>  and others).
However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent.
In Scottish Law, consent is not a defense for assault.
Arrest and other official acts.
Police officers and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an arrest or generally carrying out their official duties.
Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.
Punishment.
In some jurisdictions such as Singapore, judicial corporal punishment is part of the legal system.
The officers who administer the punishment have immunity from prosecution for assault.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable.
What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and case law.
Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for child abuse.
Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of less severe corporal punishment for children in school.
In English law, s58 Children Act 2004, limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s39 Criminal Justice Act 1988.
Prevention of crime.
This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.
Defense of property.
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in defense of property, to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 Criminal Damage Act 1971 it may be argued that the defendant has a "lawful excuse" to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 Criminal Law Act 1967) subject to the need to deter vigilantes and excessive self-help.
Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder.
The resident merely needs to assert to the court that he felt threatened by the intruder's presence.
This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.
Regional details.
Canada.
Assault is an offence under s.
265 of the Criminal Code of Canada.
Similar to the United States, there is a wide range of the type of Assault that can occur.
Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent.
It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person.
An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force.
It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.
He attempts or threatens, by an act or a gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes that other person to believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his purpose; or threats or fear of the application of force due to gestures to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed.
The Criminal Code of Canada describes Assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence).
Police Officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an Assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.
This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.
Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include: An individual cannot consent to an Assault with Weapon, Assault Causing Bodily Harm, Aggravated Assault, or any Sexual Assault.
Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon).
You cannot consent to serious bodily harm.
India.
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16, sections 351 through 358.
Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.
— s.351 of the Indian Penal Code The Code further explains that "mere words do not amount to an assault.
But the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault."
Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350).
The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.
Nigeria.
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.
Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act.
Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.
Pacific Islands.
Marshall Islands The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.
A person is guilty of this offence if he unlawfully offers or attempts, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.
Republic of Ireland.
Section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of assault causing harm.
South Africa.
South African law does not draw the distinction between assault and battery.
"Assault" is a common law crime defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him."
The law also recognises the crime of "assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm", where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health."
The common law crime of "indecent assault" was repealed by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007, and replaced by a statutory crime of "sexual assault".
United Kingdom.
Abolished offence: England and Wales.
English law provides for two offences of assault: common assault and battery.
Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence.
"Violence" in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile.
Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of battery, even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.
A common assault is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty.
Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the magistrates' court in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the Crown Court).
Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.
Scotland.
In Scots Law, assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another".
There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a "physical" attack on another's person, as demonstrated in " <START:person> Atkinson <END>  v. HM Advocate" wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a ski mask.
The court said: [A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm— <START:person> Atkinson <END>  v. HM Advocate (1987) Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or "Hamesuken" (to assault a person in his own home).
The "mens rea" for assault is simply "evil intent", although this has been held to mean no more than that assault "cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently" as upheld in "Lord Advocate's Reference No 2 of 1992" where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.
It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of his duty, under section 41 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
Northern Ireland.
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland.
The Offences against the Person Act 1861 creates the offences of: The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 creates the offences of: That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'.
under secction 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
United States.
American common law has defined assault as an attempt to commit a battery.
Assault is typically treated as a misdemeanor and not as a felony (unless it involves a law enforcement officer).
The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.
Four elements were required at common law: Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person.
The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault.
In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.
As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice.
These four elements were eventually codified in most states.
Laws on assault vary by state.
Since each state has its own laws, there is no universal assault law.
Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as battery, menacing, intimidation, reckless endangerment etc. in another state.
Modern American statutes may define assault as including: The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as exemplified below.
In Tennessee assault is defined as follows: 39-13-101.
Assault.
In Kansas the law on assault states: North Dakota law states: Simple assault.
States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double inchoate offense.
In some states, consent is a complete defense to assault.
In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a "petty misdemeanor".
In New York State assault as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120, requires an actual injury.
Other states define this as battery.
There is no crime of battery in New York.
The threat of imminent injury without physical contact in New York is called Menacing.
New York also has specific laws against Hazing when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.
Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human.
Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man.
However, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 treats the fetus as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances.
See  Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are: Ancient Greece.
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed hubris.
Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening pride, self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution.
In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well.
It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.
Violations of the law against hubris included what would today be termed assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.
Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of  <START:person> Demosthenes <END> , a prominent statesman and orator in ancient Greece.
These two examples occurred when first,  <START:person> Meidias <END>  punched  <START:person> Demosthenes <END>  in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against  <START:person> Konon <END> ) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.
Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens.
It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world.
That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved.
The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.
The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws.
Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic.
Atë, Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of his/her hubris, or great pride, that leads to his/her death or downfall.
Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame.
The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris.
This concept of honor is akin to a zero-sum game.
Rush  <START:person> Rehm <END>  simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

Abner  In the Book of  <START:person> Samuel <END> ,  <START:person> Abner <END>  (Hebrew אבנר "Avner" meaning "father of [or is a] light"), is cousin to  <START:person> Saul <END>  and commander-in-chief of his army (1  <START:person> Samuel <END>  14:50, 20:25).
He is often referred to as the son of Ner.
Biography.
 <START:person> Abner <END>  is only referred to incidentally in  <START:person> Saul <END> 's history (1  <START:person> Samuel <END>  17:55, 26:5), first appearing as the commander who introduced  <START:person> David <END>  to  <START:person> Saul <END>  following  <START:person> David <END> 's killing of Goliath.
He is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous battle of Gilboa when  <START:person> Saul <END> 's power was crushed.
Seizing the youngest but only surviving of  <START:person> Saul <END> 's sons, Ish-bosheth,  <START:person> Abner <END>  set him up as king over Israel at Mahanaim, east of the Jordan.
 <START:person> David <END> , who was accepted as king by  <START:person> Judah <END>  alone, was meanwhile reigning at Hebron, and for some time war was carried on between the two parties.
The only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy, inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at Gibeon between twelve chosen men from each side, in which the whole twenty-four seem to have perished (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  2:12).
In the general engagement which followed,  <START:person> Abner <END>  was defeated and put to flight.
He was closely pursued by  <START:person> Asahel <END> , brother of  <START:person> Joab <END> , who is said to have been "light of foot as a wild roe" (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  2:18).
As  <START:person> Asahel <END>  would not desist from the pursuit, though warned,  <START:person> Abner <END>  was compelled to slay him in self-defence.
This originated a deadly feud between the leaders of the opposite parties, for  <START:person> Joab <END> , as next of kin to  <START:person> Asahel <END> , was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood.
However, according to  <START:person> Josephus <END> , in Antiquities, Book 7, Chapter 1,  <START:person> Joab <END>  had forgiven  <START:person> Abner <END>  for the death of his brother,  <START:person> Asahel <END> , the reason being that  <START:person> Abner <END>  had slain  <START:person> Asahel <END>  honorably in combat after he had first warned  <START:person> Asahel <END>  and had no other choice but to kill him out of self-defense.
This battle was part of a civil war between  <START:person> David <END>  and Ish-bosheth, the son of  <START:person> Saul <END> .
After this battle  <START:person> Abner <END>  switched to the side of  <START:person> David <END>  and granted him control over the tribe of  <START:person> Benjamin <END> .
This act put  <START:person> Abner <END>  in  <START:person> David <END> 's favor.
The real reason that  <START:person> Joab <END>  killed  <START:person> Abner <END>  was that he became a threat to his rank of general.
He then justifies it later by mentioning his brother.
For some time afterward the war was carried on, the advantage being invariably on the side of  <START:person> David <END> .
At length, Ish-bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing  <START:person> Abner <END>  of sleeping with  <START:person> Rizpah <END>  (cf. 2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3:7), one of  <START:person> Saul <END> 's concubines, an alliance which, according to contemporary notions, would imply pretensions to the throne (cf. 2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  16:21ff.).
 <START:person> Abner <END>  was indignant at the rebuke, and immediately opened negotiations with  <START:person> David <END> , who welcomed him on the condition that his wife  <START:person> Michal <END>  should be restored to him.
This was done, and the proceedings were ratified by a feast.
Almost immediately after, however,  <START:person> Joab <END> , who had been sent away, perhaps intentionally returned and slew  <START:person> Abner <END>  at the gate of Hebron.
The ostensible motive for the assassination was a desire to avenge  <START:person> Asahel <END> , and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time.
The conduct of  <START:person> David <END>  after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act, though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3:31-39; cf. 1 Kings 2:31ff.).
 <START:person> David <END>  had  <START:person> Abner <END>  buried in Hebron (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3.31-39).
His tomb, according to a medieval Jewish tradition, is considered to be in a building not far from the Cave of the Patriarchs.
Soon after  <START:person> Abner <END> 's death, Ish-bosheth was assassinated as he slept (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  4), and  <START:person> David <END>  became king of the reunited kingdoms (2 Samuel 5).
 <START:person> Ahmed III  Ahmed III <END>  (Ottoman Turkish: احمد ثالث "Aḥmed-i sālis") (December 30/31, 1673 – July 1, 1736) was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a son of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–87).
His mother was  <START:person> Mâh-Pâre Ummatullah <END>  (Emetullah) Râbi'a Gül-Nûş Valide Sultan, originally named  <START:person> Evmania Voria <END> , who was an ethnic Greek.
He was born at Hajioglupazari, in Dobruja.
He succeeded to the throne in 1703 on the abdication of his brother  <START:person> Mustafa II <END>  (1695–1703).
 <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha <END>  and his daughter,  <START:person> Hatice Sultan <END>  (wife of the former) directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the "Tulip Era".
Biography.
 <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of Russia's menacing attitude; in fact, both his wives were Frenchwomen.
He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to  <START:person> Charles XII <END>  of Sweden (1682–1718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of  <START:person> Peter <END>  I of Russia (1672–1725) in the Battle of Poltava of 1709.
In 1710  <START:person> Charles XII <END>  convinced  <START:person> Sultan Ahmed III <END>  to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under  <START:person> Baltacı Mehmet Pasha <END>  won a major victory at the Battle of Prut.
In the aftermath, Russia returned Azov back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of Taganrog and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Forced against his will into war with Russia,  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  came nearer than any Ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his grand vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha <END>  succeeded in completely surrounding at the Pruth River Campaign in 1711.
The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished.
However, this was halted as a report reached Constantinople that the Safavids were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia.
Sultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen Janissaries, led by the Albanian  <START:person> Patrona Halil <END> , was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.
 <START:person> Ahmed <END>  voluntarily led his nephew  <START:person> Mahmud <END>  I (1730–54) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire.
He then retired to the Kafes previously occupied by  <START:person> Mahmud <END>  and died at Topkapı Palace after six years of confinement.
Character of  <START:person> Ahmed III <END> 's rule.
The reign of  <START:person> Ahmed III <END> , which had lasted for twenty-seven years, although marked by the disasters of the Great Turkish War, was not unsuccessful.
The recovery of  <START:person> Azov <END>  and the  <START:person> Morea <END> , and the conquest of part of Persia, managed to counterbalance the Balkan territory ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy through the Treaty of Passarowitz, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18.
In 1716, he sent an army of 33,000 men to capture Corfu from the Republic of Venice.
 <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  left the finances of the Ottoman Empire in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures.
He was a cultivated patron of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first printing press authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Constantinople, operated by  <START:person> Ibrahim Muteferrika <END>  (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).
It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the Danubian Principalities was introduced: previously, the Porte had appointed Hospodars, usually native Moldavian and Wallachian boyars, to administer those provinces; after the Russian campaign of 1711, during which  <START:person> Peter <END>  the Great found an ally in Moldavia Prince  <START:person> Dimitrie Cantemir <END> , the Porte began overtly deputizing Phanariote Greeks in that region, and extended the system to Wallachia after Prince  <START:person> Stefan Cantacuzino <END>  established links with  <START:person> Eugene of Savoy <END> .
The Phanariotes constituted a kind of "Dhimmi" nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.

In the year 1712, the Mughal Emperor  <START:person> Jahandar Shah <END> , a grandson of  <START:person> Aurangzeb <END>  sent gifts to the Ottoman Sultan  <START:person> Ahmad III <END>  and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer.
Farrukhsiyar.
The Mughal Emperor  <START:person> Farrukhsiyar <END>  a grandson of  <START:person> Aurangzeb <END> , is also known to have sent a letter to the Ottomans but this time it was received by the Grand Vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha <END>  providing a graphic description of the efforts of the Mughal commander  <START:person> Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha <END>  against the Rajput and Maratha rebellion.
Marriages and issue.
He married  <START:person> Aminā <END>  ( <START:person> Emine <END> ) Mihr-î-Mâh Sultan and Râbi'a Sermi Sultan.
By the first wife he had  <START:person> Mustafa III <END>  and by the second wife he had  <START:person> Abdul Hamid I. <END> 
One of his daughters was  <START:person> Zeynep Asıme Sultan <END> .
Zeynep Sultan Mosque was built by her order.
 <START:person> Fatma Sultan <END>  was also his daughter and was married to grand vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha <END> , by whom she directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the Tulip Era.
In fiction.
In Voltaire's "Candide", the eponymous main character meets the deposed  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  on a ship from Venice to Constantinople.
The Sultan is in the company of five other deposed European monarchs, and he tells  <START:person> Candide <END> , who initially doubts his credentials: I am not jesting, my name is  <START:person> Achmet III <END> .
For several years I was Sultan; I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me; they cut off the heads of my viziers; I am ending my days in the old seraglio; my nephew,  <START:person> Sultan Mahmoud <END> , sometimes allows me to travel for my health, and I have come to spend the Carnival at Venice."
This episode was taken up by the modern Turkish writer  <START:person> Nedim Gürsel <END>  as the setting of his 2001 novel "Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul".
In fact, there is no evidence of the deposed Sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels, nor did  <START:person> Voltaire <END>  (or Gürsel) assert that it had any actual historical foundation.

Media related to at Wikimedia Commons+  Works written by or about at Wikisource  Agesilaus II  Agesilaus II (; Greek: Ἀγησίλαος "Agesilaos"; c. 444 – c. 360 BC), was a Eurypontid king of the Ancient Greek city-state of Sparta, ruling from approximately 400 BC to 360 BC, during most of which time he was, in Plutarch's words, "as good as thought commander and king of all Greece," and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country's deeds and fortunes.
Small in stature and lame from birth,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  became ruler somewhat unexpectedly in his mid-forties.
His reign saw successful military incursions into various states in Asia Minor, as well as successes in the Corinthian War; although several diplomatic decisions resulted in Sparta becoming increasingly isolated prior to his death at the age of 84 in Cyrenaica.
He was greatly admired by his friend, the historian  <START:person> Xenophon <END> , who wrote a minor work about him titled "Agesilaus".
History.
Early life.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was the son of Archidamus II and his second wife,  <START:person> Eupoleia <END> , brother to Cynisca (the first woman in ancient history to achieve an Olympic victory), and younger half-brother of Agis II.
There is little surviving detail on the youth of Agesilaus.
Born with one leg shorter, he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king Agis II, especially because the latter had a son (Leotychidas).
Therefore,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was trained in the traditional curriculum of Sparta, the "agoge."
However,  <START:person> Leotychidas <END>  was ultimately set aside as illegitimate (contemporary rumors representing him as the son of Alcibiades) and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  became king around 401 BC, at the age of about forty.
In addition to questions of his nephew's paternity,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> ' succession was largely due to the intervention of his Spartan general,  <START:person> Lysander <END> , who hoped to find in him a willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs.
 <START:person> Lysander <END>  and the young  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  came to maintain an intimate relation (see Pederasty in Ancient Greece), as was common of the period.
Their unique relationship would serve an important role during  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> ' later campaigns in Asia Minor.
Early reign.
Agesilaus is first recorded as king during the suppression of the conspiracy of Cinadon, shortly after 398 BC.
Then, in 396 BC,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  crossed into Asia with a force of 2,000 neodamodes (freed helots) and 6,000 allies (including 30 Spartiates) to liberate Greek cities from Persian dominion.
On the eve of sailing from Aulis he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as  <START:person> Agamemnon <END>  had done before the Trojan expedition, but the Thebans intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them.
On his arrival at Ephesus a three months' truce was concluded with Tissaphernes, the satrap of  <START:person> Lydia <END>  and Caria, but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  raided Phrygia, where he easily won immense booty from the satrap Pharnabazus;  <START:person> Tissaphernes <END>  could offer no assistance, as he had concentrated his troops in Caria.
In these campaigns  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  also benefited from the aid of the Ten Thousand (a mercenary army), who marched through miles of Persian territory to reach the Black Sea.
After spending the winter organizing a cavalry force ("hippeis"), he made a successful incursion into  <START:person> Lydia <END>  in the spring of 395 BC.
Tithraustes was sent to replace  <START:person> Tissaphernes <END> , who paid with his life for his continued failure.
An armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , who left the southern satrapy and again invaded Phrygia, which he ravaged until the following spring.
He then came to an agreement with Pharnabazus and once more turned southward.
During these campaigns,  <START:person> Lysander <END>  attempted to manipulate  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  into ceding his authority.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , the former passive lover of  <START:person> Lysander <END> , would have nothing of this, and reminded  <START:person> Lysander <END>  (who was only a Spartan general) who was king.
He had  <START:person> Lysander <END>  sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the Aegean.
This dominating move by  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  earned the respect of his men-at-arms and of  <START:person> Lysander <END>  himself, who remained emotionally close with Agesilaus.
In 394 BC, while encamped on the plain of Thebe, he was planning a campaign in the interior, or even an attack on Artaxerxes II himself, when he was recalled to Greece owing to the war between Sparta and the combined forces of Athens, Thebes, Corinth,  <START:person> Argos <END>  and several minor states.
A rapid march through Thrace and Macedonia brought him to Thessaly, where he repulsed the Thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him.
Reinforced by  <START:person> Phocian <END>  and Orchomenian troops and a Spartan army, he met the confederate forces at Coronea in Boeotia and in a hotly contested battle was technically victorious.
However, the Spartan baggage train was ransacked and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  himself was injured during the fighting, resulting in a subsequent retreat by way of Delphi to the Peloponnese.
Shortly before this battle the Spartan navy, of which he had received the supreme command, was totally defeated off Cnidus by a powerful Persian fleet under Conon and Pharnabazus.
During these conflicts in mainland Greece,  <START:person> Lysander <END>  perished while attacking the walls of Thebes.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END> , the second king of Sparta (see Spartan Constitution for more information on Sparta's dual monarchy), was supposed to provide  <START:person> Lysander <END>  with reinforcements as they marched into Boeotia, yet failed to arrive in time to assist  <START:person> Lysander <END> , likely because  <START:person> Pausanias <END>  disliked him for his brash and arrogant attitude towards the Spartan royalty and government.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END>  failed to fight for the bodies of the dead, and because he retrieved the bodies under truce (a sign of defeat), he was disgraced and banished from Sparta.
In 393 BC, Agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of Argolis.
In 392 BC he took a prominent part in the Corinthian War, making several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory and capturing Lechaeum and Piraeus.
The loss, however, of a battalion (mora), destroyed by Iphicrates, neutralized these successes, and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  returned to Sparta.
In 389 BC he conducted a campaign in Acarnania, but two years later the Peace of Antalcidas, warmly supported by  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , put an end to hostilities.
In this interval,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  declined command over Sparta's aggression on Mantineia, and justified  <START:person> Phoebidas <END> ' seizure of the Theban Cadmea so long as the outcome provided glory to Sparta.
Decline.
When war broke out afresh with Thebes,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  twice invaded Boeotia (in 378 BC and 377 BC), although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness.
In the congress of 371 BC an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general  <START:person> Epaminondas <END> , and due to his influence, Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace, and orders given for Cleombrotus to march against Thebes in 371 BC.
 <START:person> Cleombrotus <END>  was defeated at Leuctra and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.
In 370 BC Agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to Mantineia, and reassured the Spartans with an invasion of Arcadia.
He preserved an un-walled Sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of helots, perioeci and even other Spartans; and against external enemies, with four different armies led by  <START:person> Epaminondas <END>  penetrating Laconia that same year.
Again, in 362 BC,  <START:person> Epaminondas <END>  almost succeeded in seizing the city with a rapid and unexpected march.
The Battle of Mantinea, in which  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy.
According to  <START:person> Xenophon <END> ,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , in order to gain money for prosecuting the war, supported the satrap Ariobarzanes II in his revolt against Artaxerxes II in 364 BC (Revolt of the Satraps), and in 361 BC he went to Egypt at the head of a mercenary force to aid the king Nectanebo I and his regent Teos against Persia.
He soon transferred his services to Teos's cousin and rival  <START:person> Nectanebo II <END> , who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 talents.
On his way home  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  died in Cyrenaica, around the age of 84, after a reign of some 41 years.
His body was embalmed in wax, and buried at Sparta.
Legacy.
Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was lame from birth.
These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an oracle having warned Sparta against a "lame reign."
Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in guerrilla warfare, alert and quick, yet cautious—a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time.
Of his courage, temperance, and hardiness, many instances are cited: and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend.
As examples: there is the story of his riding across a stick (horse made of stick) with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children; and because of the affection of his son  <START:person> Archidamus <END> ' for  <START:person> Cleonymus <END> , he saved Sphodrias,  <START:person> Cleonymus <END> ' father, from execution for his incursion into the Piraeus, and dishonorable retreat, in 378 BC.
Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus' reputation and achievements, reckoning him an excellent soldier, but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and siegecraft.
As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign: commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in Asia; and in extreme age, maintaining his prostrate country.
Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the Battle of Leuctra and thus the end of Spartan hegemony.
Other historical accounts paint  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  as a prototype for the ideal leader.
His awareness, thoughtfulness, and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically, while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic Greek commander.
These historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by  <START:person> Lysander <END>  in the former Athenian Empire and the failures of Spartan leaders (such as  <START:person> Pausanias <END>  and Kleombrotos) for the eventually suppression of Spartan power.
The ancient historian  <START:person> Xenophon <END>  was a huge admirer and served under Agesilaus during the campaigns into Asia Minor.
 <START:person> Plutarch <END>  includes among his 78 essays and speeches comprising the apophthegmata Agesilaus' letter to the ephors on his recall: We have reduced most of Asia, driven back the barbarians, made arms abundant in Ionia.
But since you bid me, according to the decree, come home, I shall follow my letter, may perhaps be even before it.
For my command is not mine, but my country's and her allies'.
And a commander then commands truly according to right when he sees his own commander in the laws and ephors, or others holding office in the state.
And when asked whether he wanted a memorial erected in his honor: If I have done any noble action, that is a sufficient memorial; if I have done nothing noble, all the statues in the world will not preserve my memory.
He lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field, and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty, he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth.
He was succeeded by his son  <START:person> Archidamus III <END> .
Selected quotes.
When someone was praising an orator for his ability to magnify small points, he said, "In my opinion it's not a good cobbler who fits large shoes on small feet."
Another time he watched a mouse being pulled from its hole by a small boy.
When the mouse turned around, bit the hand of its captor and escaped, he pointed this out to those present and said, "When the tiniest creature defends itself like this against aggressors, what ought men to do, do you reckon?"
Certainly when somebody asked what gain the laws of  <START:person> Lycurgus <END>  had brought Sparta, he answered, "Contempt for pleasures."
Asked once how far Sparta's boundaries stretched, he brandished his spear and said, "As far as this can reach."
On noticing a house in Asia roofed with square beams, he asked the owner whether timber grew square in that area.
When told no, it grew round, he said, "What then?
If it were square, would you make it round?"
As he was dying on the voyage back from Egypt, he gave instructions to those close to him that they should not be responsible for making any image of his person, be it modeled or painted or copied, "For if I have accomplished any glorious feat, that will be my memorial.
But if I have not, not even all the statues in the world—the products of vulgar, worthless men—would make any difference."
Invited to hear an actor who could perfectly imitate the nightingale,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  declined, saying he had heard the nightingale itself.
 <START:person> Arthur Aikin  Arthur Aikin <END> , FLS, FGS (19 May 1773 – 15 April 1854) was an English chemist, mineralogist and scientific writer.
Life.
He was born at Warrington, Lancashire into a distinguished literary family of prominent Unitarians.
The best known of these was his paternal aunt,  <START:person> Anna Letitia Barbauld <END> , a woman of letters who wrote poetry and essays as well as early children's literature.
His father, Dr  <START:person> John Aikin <END> , was a medical doctor, historian, and author.
His grandfather, also called  <START:person> John Aikin <END>  (1713–1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with Warrington Academy.
His sister  <START:person> Lucy <END>  (1781–1864) was a historical writer.
Their brother  <START:person> Charles <END>  was adopted by their famous aunt and brought up as their cousin.
 <START:person> Arthur Aikin <END>  studied chemistry under  <START:person> Joseph Priestley <END>  in the New College at Hackney, and gave attention to the practical applications of the science.
In early life he was a Unitarian minister for a short time.
 <START:person> Aikin <END>  lectured on chemistry at Guy's Hospital for thirty-two years.
From 1803 to 1808 he was editor of the "Annual Review".
He was one of the founders of the Geological Society of London in 1807 and was its honorary secretary in 1812–1817.
He contributed papers on the Wrekin and the Shropshire coalfield, among others, to the transactions of that society.
Later he became Secretary of the Royal Society of Arts.
He was founder of the Chemical Society of London in 1841, being its first Treasurer and second President.
He was highly esteemed as a man of sound judgment and wide knowledge, he was also elected as FRSA, having served as its Secretary.
 <START:person> Aikin <END>  died at Hoxton in London.
Publications.
For " <START:person> Rees <END> 's Cyclopædia" he wrote articles about Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy, but the topics are not known.
Ajax (mythology)  Ajax or Aias ( or ; Ancient Greek: Αἴας, gen.
Αἴαντος) was a mythological Greek hero, the son of King Telamon and Periboea, and the half-brother of Teucer.
He plays an important role in Homer's "Iliad" and in the Epic Cycle, a series of epic poems about the Trojan War.
To distinguish him from Ajax, son of Oileus (Ajax the Lesser), he is called "Telamonian Ajax," "Greater Ajax," or "Ajax the Great".
In Etruscan mythology, he is known as Aivas Tlamunus.
Family.
Ajax is the son of Telamon, who was the son of Aeacus and grandson of Zeus, and his first wife  <START:person> Periboea <END> .
He is the cousin of Achilles, and is the elder half-brother of Teucer.
Many illustrious Athenians, including  <START:person> Cimon <END> ,  <START:person> Miltiades <END> ,  <START:person> Alcibiades <END>  and the historian Thucydides, traced their descent from Ajax.
The Italian scholar  <START:person> Maggiani <END>  recently showed that on an Etruscan tomb dedicated to  <START:person> Racvi Satlnei <END>  in Bologna (5th century BC) there is a writing that says: "aivastelmunsl = family of Ajax Télamon".
Description.
In Homer's "Iliad" he is described as of great stature, colossal frame and strongest of all the Achaeans.
Known as the "bulwark of the Achaeans", he was trained by the centaur Chiron (who had trained Ajax' father Telamon and  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' father  <START:person> Peleus <END>  and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by Heracles, whom he was at the time training), at the same time as  <START:person> Achilles <END> .
He was described as vicious, fearless, strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence.
Ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow-hides with a layer of bronze.
Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the "Iliad", and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles, although, in book 13, Poseidon strikes Ajax with his staff, renewing his strength.
Trojan War.
In the "Iliad", Ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage, seen particularly in two fights with  <START:person> Hector <END> .
In Book 7, Ajax is chosen by lot to meet  <START:person> Hector <END>  in a duel which lasts most of a whole day.
Ajax at first gets the better of the encounter, wounding  <START:person> Hector <END>  with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone, but  <START:person> Hector <END>  fights on until the heralds, acting at the direction of Zeus, call a draw: the action ends without a winner and with the two combatants exchanging gifts, Ajax giving  <START:person> Hector <END>  a purple sash and  <START:person> Hector <END>  giving Ajax his sharp sword.
The second fight between Ajax and  <START:person> Hector <END>  occurs when the latter breaks into the Mycenaean camp, and fights with the Greeks among the ships.
In Book 14, Ajax throws a giant rock at Hector which almost kills him.
In Book 15,  <START:person> Hector <END>  is restored to his strength by Apollo and returns to attack the ships.
Ajax, wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship, holds off the Trojan armies virtually single-handedly.
In Book 16,  <START:person> Hector <END>  and Ajax duel once again.
 <START:person> Hector <END>  is set on burning the ships, the only way he feels the Greeks will truly be defeated.
 <START:person> Hector <END>  is able to disarm Ajax (although Ajax is not hurt) and Ajax is forced to retreat, seeing that Zeus is clearly favoring  <START:person> Hector <END> .
 <START:person> Hector <END>  and the Trojans succeed in burning one Greek ship, the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war.
Ajax is responsible for the death of many Trojans lords, including Phorcys.
Ajax often fought in tandem with his brother  <START:person> Teucer <END> , known for his skill with the bow.
Ajax would wield his magnificent shield, as  <START:person> Teucer <END>  stood behind picking off enemy Trojans.
 <START:person> Achilles <END>  was absent during these encounters because of his feud with Agamemnon.
In Book 9, Agamemnon and the other Mycenaean chiefs send Ajax, Odysseus and Phoenix to the tent of Achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight.
Although Ajax speaks earnestly and is well received, he does not succeed in convincing Achilles.
When Patroclus is killed,  <START:person> Hector <END>  tries to steal his body.
Ajax, assisted by  <START:person> Menelaus <END> , succeeds in fighting off the Trojans and taking the body back with his chariot; however, the Trojans had already stripped Patroclus of Achilles' armor.
Ajax's prayer to Zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial.
According to  <START:person> Hyginus <END> , in total, Ajax killed 28 people at Troy.
Death.
Like most of the other Greek leaders, Ajax is alive and well as the "Iliad" comes to a close.
When  <START:person> Achilles <END>  dies, killed by Paris (with help from Apollo), Ajax and  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  are the heroes who fight against the Trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion, Patroclus.
Ajax, with his great shield and spear, manages to drive off the Trojans, while  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  pulls the body to his chariot, and rides away with it to safety.
After the burial, each claims  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' magical armor for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts.
After several days of competition, Odysseus and Ajax are tied for the ownership of the divine armor, which had been forged on Mount Olympus by the smith-god Hephaestus.
It is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor.
Ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the Greeks, including saving the ships from  <START:person> Hector <END> , and driving him off with a massive rock, he deserves the armor.
However,  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  proves to be more eloquent, and the council gives him the armor.
Ajax, "Unconquered", and furious, falls upon his own sword, "conquered by his [own] sorrow".
The Belvedere Torso, a marble torso now in the Vatican Museums, is considered to depict Ajax "in the act of contemplating his suicide".
In Sophocles' play "Ajax", a famous retelling of Ajax's demise, after the armor is awarded to Odysseus Ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill Agamemnon and  <START:person> Menelaus <END> .
Athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision, and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them, imagining they are the Achaean leaders, including Odysseus and Agamemnon.
When he comes to his senses, covered in blood, he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor, and decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than live in shame.
He does so with the same sword which  <START:person> Hector <END>  gave him when they exchanged presents.
From his blood sprang a red flower, as at the death of Hyacinthus, which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name "Ai," also expressive of lament.
His ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the Rhoetean promontory at the entrance of the Hellespont.
Ajax's half-brother  <START:person> Teucer <END>  stood trial before his father for not bringing Ajax's body or weapons back.
 <START:person> Teucer <END>  was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence.
He was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home, the island of Salamis off the coast of Athens.
Homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of Ajax's death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' armor; when Odysseus visits Hades, he begs the soul of Ajax to speak to him, but Ajax, still resentful over the old quarrel, refuses and descends silently back into Erebus.
Like  <START:person> Achilles <END> , he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death on the island of Leuke at the mouth of the Danube.
Ajax, who in the post-Homeric legend is described as the grandson of Aeacus and the great-grandson of Zeus, was the tutelary hero of the island of Salamis, where he had a temple and an image, and where a festival called "Aianteia" was celebrated in his honour.
At this festival a couch was set up, on which the panoply of the hero was placed, a practice which recalls the Roman Lectisternium.
The identification of Ajax with the family of  <START:person> Aeacus <END>  was chiefly a matter which concerned the Athenians, after Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion Solon is said to have inserted a line in the "Iliad" (2.557–558), for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island.
Ajax then became an Attic hero; he was worshiped at Athens, where he had a statue in the market-place, and the tribe "Aiantis" was named after him.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END>  also relates that a gigantic skeleton, its kneecap 5 in in diameter, appeared on the beach near Sigeion, on the Trojan coast; these bones were identified as those of Ajax.
Other.
There is a legend that Ajax founded the city of Ajaccio in the mediterranean island of Corsica (now part of France) and gave it his name.
Palace.
In 2001,  <START:person> Yannos Lolos <END>  began excavating a Mycenaean palace on the island of Salamis which he supposed to be the home of the mythological Aiacid dynasty.
The ruins have been excavated at a site near the village of Kanakia of Salamis, a few miles off the coast of Athens.
The multi-story structure covers 750 m2 and had perhaps 30 rooms.
The Trojan War is supposed by many to have occurred at the height of the Mycenaean civilization (see discussion of Troy VII), roughly the point at which this palace appears to have been abandoned.
 <START:person> Alexander II of Epirus  Alexander II <END>  was a king of Epirus, and the son of  <START:person> Pyrrhus <END>  and  <START:person> Lanassa <END> , the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant  <START:person> Agathocles <END> .
Reign.
He succeeded his father as king in 272 BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with  <START:person> Antigonus II Gonatas <END> , whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of Macedon.
He was, however, dispossessed of both Macedon and Epirus by  <START:person> Demetrius II <END>  of Macedon, the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the Acarnanians.
By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus.
It appears that he was in alliance with the Aetolians.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  married his paternal half-sister Olympias, by whom he had two sons,  <START:person> Pyrrhus <END> ,  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  and a daughter, Phthia.
On the death of  <START:person> Alexander <END> , around 242 BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to  <START:person> Demetrius <END> .
There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.
The former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephant's head.
The reverse represents  <START:person> Pallas <END>  holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt.
Relations with India.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  is apparently mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor  <START:person> Ashoka <END> 's Buddhist proselytism.
 <START:person> Alexander of Aphrodisias  Alexander <END>  of Aphrodisias (Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀφροδισιεύς; fl.
200 AD) was a Peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the Ancient Greek commentators on the writings of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> .
He was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria, and lived and taught in Athens at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the Peripatetic school.
He wrote many commentaries on the works of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , extant are those on the "Prior Analytics", "Topics", "Meteorology", "Sense and Sensibilia", and "Metaphysics".
Several original treatises also survive, and include a work "On Fate", in which he argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity; and one "On the Soul".
His commentaries on  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, "the commentator" (ὁ ἐξηγητής).
Life and career.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria and came to Athens towards the end of the 2nd century.
He was a student of the two Stoic, or possibly Peripatetic, philosophers Sosigenes and Herminus, and perhaps of  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  of Mytilene.
At Athens he became head of the Peripatetic school and lectured on Peripatetic philosophy.
 <START:person> Alexander <END> 's dedication of "On Fate" to  <START:person> Septimius Severus <END>  and  <START:person> Caracalla <END> , in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209.
A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as  <START:person> Titus Aurelius Alexander <END> .
His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor  <START:person> Antoninus Pius <END> , while proconsul of Asia.
The inscription honours his father, also called  <START:person> Alexander <END>  and also a philosopher.
This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's corpus should be ascribed to his father.
Commentaries.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  composed several commentaries on the works of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , in which he sought to escape a syncretistic tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> .
His extant commentaries are on "Prior Analytics" (Book 1), "Topics", "Meteorology", "Sense and Sensibilia", and "Metaphysics" (Books 1-5).
The commentary on the "Sophistical Refutations" is deemed spurious, as is the commentary on the final nine books of the "Metaphysics".
The lost commentaries include works on the "De Interpretatione", "Posterior Analytics", "Physics", "On the Heavens", "On Generation and Corruption", "On the Soul", and "On Memory".
Simplicius of Cilicia mentions that  <START:person> Alexander <END>  provided commentary on the quadrature of the lunes, and the corresponding problem of squaring the circle.
In April 2007, it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on  <START:person> Aristotle <END> 's "Categories" in the Archimedes Palimpsest, and  <START:person> Robert Sharples <END>  suggested  <START:person> Alexander <END>  as the most likely author.
Original treatises.
There are also several extant original writings by  <START:person> Alexander <END> .
These include: "On the Soul", "Problems and Solutions", "Ethical Problems", "On Fate", and "On Mixture and Growth".
Three works attributed to him are considered spurious: "Medical Questions", "Physical Problems", and "On Fevers".
Additional works by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  are preserved in Arabic translation, these include: "On the Principles of the Universe", "On Providence", and "Against  <START:person> Galen <END>  on Motion".
"On the Soul" ("De anima") is a treatise on the soul written along the lines suggested by  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  in his own "De anima".
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material ("nous hulikos") and inseparable from the body.
He argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul's immortality.
He identified the active intellect ("nous poietikos"), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with God.
A second book is known as the "Supplement to On the Soul" ("Mantissa").
The "Mantissa" is a series of twenty-five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with psychology.
The remaining twenty pieces cover problems in physics and ethics, of which the largest group deals with questions of vision and light, and the final four with fate and providence.
The "Mantissa" was probably not written by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  in its current form, but much of the actual material may be his.
"Problems and Solutions" ("Quaestiones") consists of three books which, although termed "problems and solutions of physical questions," treat of subjects which are not all physical, and are not all problems.
Among the sixty-nine items in these three books, twenty-four deal with physics, seventeen with psychology, eleven with logic and metaphysics, and six with questions of fate and providence.
It is unlikely that  <START:person> Alexander <END>  wrote all of the "Quaestiones", some may be  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's own explanations, while others may be exercises by his students.
"Ethical Problems" was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the "Quaestiones".
The work is a discussion of ethical issues based on  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's school.
It is likely that the work was not written by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  himself, but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving  <START:person> Alexander <END> .
"On Fate" is a treatise in which  <START:person> Alexander <END>  argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity.
In "On Fate"  <START:person> Alexander <END>  denied three things necessity (Greek: ἀνάγκη), the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature, and determinism in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand (Greek: προκαταβεβλημένος) or predetermined by antecedents (Greek: προηγουμένος).
He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today.
"On Mixture and Growth" discusses the topic of mixture of physical bodies.
It is both an extended discussion (and polemic) on Stoic physics, and an exposition of Aristotelian thought on this theme.
"On the Principles of the Universe" is preserved in Arabic translation.
This treatise is not mentioned in surviving Greek sources, but it enjoyed great popularity in the Muslim world, and a large number of copies have survived.
The main purpose of this work is to give a general account of Aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics, but it also has a polemical tone, and it may be directed at rival views within the Peripatetic school.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  was concerned with filling the gaps of the Aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies, while also presenting a unified picture of the world, both physical and ethical.
The topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the sublunar world of generation and decay.
His principal sources are the "Physics" (book 7), "Metaphysics" (book 12), and the Pseudo-Aristotelian "On the Universe".
"On Providence" survives in two Arabic versions.
In this treatise,  <START:person> Alexander <END>  opposes the Stoic view that divine Providence extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods.
Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.
Influence.
By the 6th century  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's commentaries on  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  were considered so useful that he was referred to as "the commentator" (Greek: ὁ ἐξηγητής).
His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the Arabs, who translated many of them, and he is heavily quoted by Maimonides.
In 1210, the Church Council of Paris issued a condemnation, which probably targeted the writings of  <START:person> Alexander <END>  among others.
In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by  <START:person> Pietro Pomponazzi <END>  (against the Thomists and the Averroists), and by his successor  <START:person> Cesare Cremonini <END> .
This school is known as Alexandrists.
 <START:person> Alexander <END> 's band, an optical phenomenon, is named after him.
Modern editions.
Several of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's works were published in the Aldine edition of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , Venice, 1495–1498; his "De Fato" and "De Anima" were printed along with the works of Themistius at Venice (1534); the former work, which has been translated into Latin by  <START:person> Grotius <END>  and also by  <START:person> Schulthess <END> , was edited by  <START:person> J. C. Orelli <END> ,  <START:person> Zürich <END> , 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by  <START:person> H. Bonitz <END> , Berlin, 1847.
In 1989 the first part of his "On Aristotle Metaphysics" was published as part of the Ancient commentators project.
Since then, other works of his have been translated into English.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson  Andrew Jackson <END>  (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was the seventh President of the United States (1829–1837).
He was born near the end of the colonial era, somewhere near the then-unmarked border between North and South Carolina, into a recently immigrated Scots-Irish farming family of relatively modest means.
During the American Revolutionary War  <START:person> Jackson <END> , whose family supported the revolutionary cause, acted as a courier.
He was captured, at age 13, and mistreated by his British captors.
He later became a lawyer, and in 1796 he was in Nashville and helped found the state of Tennessee.
He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and then to the U.S. Senate.
In 1801,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia, which became his political as well as military base.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  owned hundreds of slaves who worked on the Hermitage plantation which he acquired in 1804.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  killed a man in a duel in 1806, over a matter of honor regarding his wife  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  gained national fame through his role in the War of 1812, most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at the Battle of New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's army was then sent to Florida where he deposed the small Spanish garrison.
This led directly to the treaty which formally transferred Florida from Spain to the United States.
Nominated for president in 1824,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  narrowly lost to  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's supporters then founded what became the Democratic Party.
Nominated again in 1828,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  crusaded against  <START:person> Adams <END>  and the "corrupt bargain" between  <START:person> Adams <END>  and  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  he said cost him the 1824 election.
Building on his base in the West and new support from Virginia and New York, he won by a landslide.
The  <START:person> Adams <END>  campaigners called him and his wife  <START:person> Rachel Jackson <END>  "bigamists"; she died just after the election and he called the slanderers "murderers," swearing never to forgive them.
His struggles with Congress were personified in his personal rivalry with  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , whom  <START:person> Jackson <END>  deeply disliked, and who led the opposition (the emerging Whig Party).
As president, he faced a threat of secession from South Carolina over the "Tariff of Abominations" which Congress had enacted under  <START:person> Adams <END> .
In contrast to several of his immediate successors, he denied the right of a state to secede from the union, or to nullify federal law.
The Nullification Crisis was defused when the tariff was amended and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  threatened the use of military force if South Carolina (or any other state) attempted to secede.
Congress attempted to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States several years before the expiration of its charter, which he opposed.
He vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832, and dismantled it by the time its charter expired in 1836.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the "spoils system" in American politics.
Also, he supported, signed, and enforced the Indian Removal Act, which relocated a number of native tribes to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).
He faced and defeated  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  in the 1832 Presidential Election, and opposed  <START:person> Clay <END>  generally.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  supported his vice president  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , who was elected president in 1836.
He worked to bolster the Democratic Party and helped his friend  <START:person> James K. Polk <END>  win the 1844 presidential election.
Early life and education.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was born on March 15, 1767.
His parents were Scots-Irish colonists  <START:person> Andrew <END>  and  <START:person> Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson <END> , Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ireland two years earlier.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's parents lived in the village of Boneybefore, also in County Antrim.
When they emigrated to America in 1765,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's parents probably landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the Waxhaws region, straddling the border between North and South Carolina.
They brought two children from Ireland,  <START:person> Hugh <END>  (born 1763) and  <START:person> Robert <END>  (born 1764).
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father died in an accident in February 1767, at the age of 29, three weeks before his son  <START:person> Andrew <END>  was born in the Waxhaws area.
His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father.
The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed.
In 1824,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation in Lancaster County, South Carolina.
But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824, which  <START:person> Jackson <END>  opposed.
In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  received a sporadic education in the local "old-field" school.
In 1781, he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop.
Later, he taught school and studied law in Salisbury, North Carolina.
In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved to Jonesborough, in what was then the Western District of North Carolina.
This area later became the Southwest Territory (1790), the precursor to the state of Tennessee.
Revolutionary War service.
During the Revolutionary War,  <START:person> Jackson <END> , at age thirteen, informally helped the local militia as a courier.
His eldest brother,  <START:person> Hugh <END> , died from heat exhaustion during the Battle of Stono Ferry, on June 20, 1779.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  and his brother  <START:person> Robert <END>  were captured by the British and held as prisoners; they nearly starved to death in captivity.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving  <START:person> Jackson <END>  with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British.
While imprisoned, the brothers contracted smallpox.
 <START:person> Robert Jackson <END>  died on April 27, 1781, a few days after their mother  <START:person> Elizabeth <END>  secured the brothers' release.
After being assured  <START:person> Andrew <END>  would recover,  <START:person> Elizabeth Jackson <END>  volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in Charleston harbor, where there had been an outbreak of cholera.
She died from the disease in November 1781, and was buried in an unmarked grave.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  became an orphan at age 14.
Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  blamed the British for his losses.
Legal and political career.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  began his legal career in Jonesborough, now northeastern Tennessee.
Though his legal education was scanty, he knew enough to be a country lawyer on the frontier.
Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law.
Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from assault and battery.
In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor (prosecutor) of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the Territory South of the River Ohio after 1791.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796.
When Tennessee achieved statehood that year,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was elected its U.S. Representative.
The following year, he was elected U.S. Senator as a Democratic-Republican, but he resigned within a year.
(His return to the U.S. Senate in 1823, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.)
In 1798, he was appointed a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court, serving until 1804.
Land speculation and founding of Memphis.
In 1794,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  formed a business with  <START:person> John Overton <END>  "for the purpose of purchasing lands as well those lands without as within military bounds"—overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw.
Upon his return from Florida,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  negotiated the sale of the land from the Chickasaw Nation in 1818 (termed the Jackson Purchase).
He was one of the three original investors who founded Memphis, Tennessee in 1819 (see History of Memphis, Tennessee).
Hermitage plantation.
In addition to his legal and political career,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  prospered as planter, slave owner, and merchant.
He built a home and the first general store in Gallatin, Tennessee in 1803.
The next year he acquired the Hermitage, a 640 acre plantation in Davidson County, near Nashville.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  later added 360 acre to the plantation, which eventually grew to 1050 acres.
The primary crop was cotton, grown by enslaved workers.
Starting with nine slaves,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  held as many as 44 by 1820, and later held up to 150 slaves, making him among the planter elite.
Throughout his lifetime  <START:person> Jackson <END>  may have owned as many as 300 slaves.
African American men, women, and children were enslaved by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  on three sections of the Hermitage plantation.
Slaves lived in extended family units between five and ten persons quartered in 20-foot-square cabins made either of brick or logs.
The size and quality of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times.
To help slaves acquire food staples, in addition to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's rations,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  supplied slaves with guns, knives, and fishing equipment for hunting and fishing.
At times  <START:person> Jackson <END>  paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets.
The Hermitage plantation was a profit-making enterprise and  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who demanded slave loyalty, permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  at various times posted advertisements for his fugitive slaves.
For the standards of his times  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food, housing, and did not prohibit his female slaves from childbirthing.
Military career.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank of colonel.
He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802.
War of 1812.
Creek campaign and treaty.
During the War of 1812, the Shawnee chief  <START:person> Tecumseh <END>  encouraged the "Red Stick" Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements.
He had unified tribes in the Northwest to rise up against the Americans, trying to repel American settlers from those lands north of the Ohio.
Four hundred settlers were killed in the Fort Mims massacre—one of the few instances of Native Americans killing a large number of American settlers and their African-American slaves—which brought the United States into the internal Creek campaign.
Occurring at the same time as the War of 1812, the Creek campaign saw  <START:person> Jackson <END>  command the U.S. forces, which included the Tennessee militia, U.S. regulars, and Cherokee, Choctaw, and Lower Creek warriors.
 <START:person> Sam Houston <END>  and  <START:person> David Crockett <END>  served under  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in this campaign.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  defeated the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814.
US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle, but spared the chief Red Eagle, a mixed-race man also known as  <START:person> William Weatherford <END> .
After the victory,  <START:person> Madison <END> 's Secretary of War  <START:person> Armstrong <END>  ordered Major General  <START:person> Thomas Pinckney <END>  in April 1814 to make the surrender treaty.
 <START:person> Pinckney <END>  made moderate terms of surrender including handing over an unspecified amount of land, the construction of U.S. forts, turning over warriors who instigated hostilities, and agreeing to stop trade with foreign countries.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  opposed the unpopular  <START:person> Pinckney <END>  treaty, desiring to completely destroy the Creek nation.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was promoted Major General and given charge of the Seventh Military District, replacing Major General  <START:person> Thomas Flournoy <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , now commanding general, immediately threw out  <START:person> Pinckney <END> 's treaty and forced severe terms upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies, wresting twenty-two million acres in present-day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European-American settlement.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also confiscated land from Indians who had sided with the Americans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated that the terms must be accepted or the tribe would be forcefully removed to Florida.
On August 9, 1814, 35 Indian elder leaders signed  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Treaty of Fort Jackson.
The warrior faction of the Creek nation and the British, however, did not formally recognize the treaty.
According to author  <START:person> Gloria Jahoda <END> , the Creeks coined their own name for him, " <START:person> Jacksa Chula Harjo <END> " or " <START:person> Jackson <END> , old and fierce".
Battle of New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success.
When British forces threatened New Orleans,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories.
He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops.
They said he was "tough as old hickory" wood on the battlefield, and he acquired the nickname of "Old Hickory".
In the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's 5,000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7,500 British.
At the end of the battle, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing.
The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.
Enforced martial law New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  ordered the arrest of U. S. District Court Judge Dominick Hall in March 1815, after the judge signed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a Louisiana legislator that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had arrested.
 <START:person> Louis Louaillier <END>  had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's refusal to release the militia, after the British ceded the field of battle.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had claimed the authority to declare martial law over the entire City of New Orleans, not merely his "camp."
After ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, a lawyer and after intervention of  <START:person> Joshua Lewis <END> , a State Judge, who was simultaneously serving under  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the militia, and who also signed a writ of habeas corpus against  <START:person> Jackson <END> , his commanding officer, seeking Judge  <START:person> Hall <END> 's release,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  relented.
Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
But they fared better than did the six members of the militia whose executions, ordered by  <START:person> Jackson <END> , would surface as the Coffin Handbills during his 1828 Presidential campaign.
Nonetheless,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the War of 1812.
By a resolution on February 27, 1815,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  received the Thanks of Congress as well as a Congressional Gold Medal.
 <START:person> Alexis de Tocqueville <END> , "underwhelmed" by  <START:person> Jackson <END> , later commented in "Democracy in America" that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  "... was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."
First Seminole War.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  served in the military again during the First Seminole War.
He was ordered by President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  in December 1817 to lead a campaign in Georgia against the Seminole and Creek Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was also charged with preventing Spanish Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves.
Critics later alleged that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  exceeded orders in his Florida actions.
His directions were to "terminate the conflict".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida.
Before going,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote to  <START:person> Monroe <END> , "Let it be signified to me through any channel ... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."
 <START:person> Monroe <END>  gave  <START:person> Jackson <END>  orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.
The Seminole attacked  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Tennessee volunteers.
The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  burned their houses and the crops.
He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the United Kingdom encouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  captured Pensacola, Florida, with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor.
He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects,  <START:person> Robert Ambrister <END>  and  <START:person> Alexander Arbuthnot <END> , who had been supplying and advising the Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (he became known as "Sharp Knife").
The executions, and  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident.
Many in the  <START:person> Monroe <END>  administration called for  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to be censured.
The Secretary of State,  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> , an early believer in Manifest Destiny, defended  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
When the Spanish minister demanded a "suitable punishment" for  <START:person> Jackson <END> ,  <START:person> Adams <END>  wrote back, "Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory ... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact ... a post of annoyance to them."
 <START:person> Adams <END>  used  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the  <START:person> Adams <END> –Onís Treaty.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was subsequently named Florida's military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.
Election of 1824.
The Tennessee legislature nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President in 1822.
It also elected him U.S. Senator again.
By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party.
Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal Congressional nominating caucus, but this had become unpopular.
In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus.
Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary  <START:person> William H. Crawford <END>  for President and  <START:person> Albert Gallatin <END>  for Vice President.
A Pennsylvania convention nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" and was a "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [ <START:person> Crawford <END> ] was the regular democratic candidate".
Gallatin criticized  <START:person> Jackson <END>  as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office".
Besides  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Crawford <END> , the Secretary of State  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END>  and House Speaker  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  were also candidates.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot).
The electoral votes were split four ways, with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  having a plurality.
Because no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the House of Representatives, which chose  <START:person> Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  supporters denounced this result as a "corrupt bargain" because  <START:person> Clay <END>  gave his state's support to  <START:person> Adams <END> , who subsequently appointed  <START:person> Clay <END>  as Secretary of State.
As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for  <START:person> Adams <END> , and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had won the popular vote, some Kentucky politicians criticized  <START:person> Clay <END>  for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the "man of the people" had been robbed by the "corrupt aristocrats of the East".
Election of 1828.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  denounced the "corrupt bargain" that put  <START:person> Adams <END>  in the White House and laid plans for a crusade to oust  <START:person> Adams <END>  from office.
After resigning the Senate in October 1825, he continued his quest for the Presidency.
The Tennessee legislature again nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President.
He attracted Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , and  <START:person> Thomas Ritchie <END>  into his camp ( <START:person> Van Buren <END>  and  <START:person> Ritchie <END>  were previous supporters of  <START:person> Crawford <END> ).
 <START:person> Van Buren <END> , with help from his friends in Philadelphia and Richmond, revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, "restored party rivalries", and forged a national organization of durability.
The  <START:person> Jackson <END>  coalition handily defeated  <START:person> Adams <END>  in 1828.
During the election,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's opponents referred to him as a "jackass".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out.
However, it later became the symbol for the Democratic Party when cartoonist  <START:person> Thomas Nast <END>  popularized it.
The campaign was very much a personal one.
As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events.
Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's wife  <START:person> Rachel <END>  of bigamy.
Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794).
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife.
 <START:person> Rachel <END>  died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve.
He blamed the  <START:person> Adams <END>  campaigners for her death.
"May God Almighty forgive her murderers," he swore at her funeral.
"I never can."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards or morality.
(He was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation work.)
Presidency 1829–1837.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's name has been associated with the spread of democracy in terms of the passing of political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties.
"The Age of Jackson" shaped the national agenda and American politics.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's philosophy as President followed much in the same line as  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> , advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency held a high moralistic tone; having as a planter himself agrarian sympathies, a limited view of states rights and the federal government.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values.
When South Carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.
On March 4, 1829,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was the first President to invite the public to attend the White House ball honoring his first inauguration.
Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes.
The crowd became so large that  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken.
Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President.
The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's raucous populism earned him the nickname "King Mob".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that the president's authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics.
Instead of choosing party favorites,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  chose "plain, businessmen" whom he intended to control.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  chose  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  as Secretary of State,  <START:person> John Eaton <END>  Secretary of War,  <START:person> Samuel Ingham <END>  Secretary of Treasury,  <START:person> John Branch <END>  Secretary of Navy,  <START:person> John Berrien <END>  as Attorney General, and  <START:person> William T. Barry <END>  as postmaster general.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's first choice of Cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip, especially between Eaton, Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> , and  <START:person> Van Buren <END> .
By the Spring of 1831, only  <START:person> Barry <END>  remained, while the rest of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's cabinet had been discharged.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's following cabinet selections worked better together.
 <START:person> Eaton <END>  affair.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his first years in office responding to what came to be known as the  <START:person> Eaton <END>  affair.
Vicious Washington D.C. gossip circulated among  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Cabinet members and their wives including Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> 's wife Floride concerning Secretary of War  <START:person> John H. Eaton <END>  and his wife  <START:person> Peggy <END> .
Bitter rumors spread that  <START:person> Peggy <END>  was loose in her morals while working at her father's tavern when her naval officer husband was away at sea.
After  <START:person> Peggy <END> 's husband died at sea, both  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and  <START:person> Peggy <END>  were criticized for their perceived early marriage.
Initially  <START:person> Jackson <END>  thought that  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  was behind the gossip, but then he eventually concluded  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  was responsible for spreading the rumors.
Both  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  defended  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and his wife  <START:person> Peggy <END> , however  <START:person> Calhoun <END> 's wife  <START:person> Floride <END>  and the wives of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's pro-Calhoun Cabinet members publicly shunned both  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and  <START:person> Peggy <END> .
 <START:person> Van Buren <END> ,  <START:person> Eaton <END> , and  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  resigned office over the affair while  <START:person> Jackson <END>  dismissed the rest of his pro-Calhoun cabinet members except Postmaster  <START:person> William T. Barry <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  nominated  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  to be Minister to England, however,  <START:person> Calhoun <END> 's supporters in the Senate blocked the nomination giving  <START:person> Calhoun <END> , who had continued to be Vice President and President of the Senate until December 1832, the deciding vote against  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  and blocked the nomination.
 <START:person> Calhoun <END>  publically castigated and boasted that  <START:person> Van Buren <END> 's political career was over stating the defeated nomination would "...kill him, sir, kill dead.
He will never kick, sir, never kick."
This rumor however proved to be false as  <START:person> Van Buren <END> , who played a leading role in the  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's unofficial Kitchen Cabinet, allied with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and became  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's successor and Vice Presidential candidate in 1832.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also acquired the "Globe" paper that was sympathetic with the  <START:person> Jackson <END>  administration.
Indian removal policy.
Throughout his two terms in office, lasting eight years,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  made approximately 70 treaties with native American tribes both in the South and the Northwest.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked a new era in Indian-Anglo American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates.
The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminole and the Cherokee.
The northwest tribes include the Chippewa, Ottawa, and the Potawatomi.
Though conflict between Indians and American settlers took place in the north and in the south, the problem was worse in the south where the Indian populations were larger.
Indian wars broke out repeatedly, often when native tribes, especially the Muscogee and Seminole Indians, refused to abide by the treaties for various reasons.
The Second Seminole War, started in December 1835, lasted over six years finally ending in August 1842 under President  <START:person> John Tyler <END> .
Though relations between Europeans (and later Americans) and Indians were always complicated, they grew increasingly complicated once American settlements began pushing further west in the years after the American Revolution.
Often these relations were peaceful, though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent, both on the part of American settlers and the Indians.
From  <START:person> George Washington <END>  to  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> , the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly; though by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable.
The problem was especially acute in the south (in particular the lands near the state of Georgia), where Indian populations were larger, denser, and more Americanized than those of the north.
As such, there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem, and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain Indian populations.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , never one known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency.
This contrasted from his immediate predecessor, President  <START:person> John Q. Adams <END> , who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors, that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency thus took place in a new era in Indian-Anglo American relations, in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation.
As such, during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency, Indian relations between the Southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture.
In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  advocated land west of the Mississippi River be set aside for Indian tribes.
Congress had been developing its own Indian relocation bill, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had many supporters in both the Senate and House who agreed with his goal.
On May 26, 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed it into law.
The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.
The passage of the bill was  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's first successful legislative triumph and marked the Democratic party's emergence into American political society.
The passage of the act was especially popular in the South where population growth and the discovery of gold on Cherokee land had increased pressure on tribal lands.
The state of Georgia became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 U.S. Supreme Court decision ("Worcester v. Georgia").
In that decision, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice  <START:person> John Marshall <END> , in writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  is frequently, though incorrectly, attributed with the following response: " <START:person> John Marshall <END>  has made his decision, now let him enforce it".
The quote originated in 1863 from  <START:person> Horace Greeley <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used the Georgia crisis to broker an agreement whereby the Cherokee leaders agreed to a removal treaty.
A group of Cherokees led by  <START:person> John Ridge <END>  negotiated the Treaty of New Echota with  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's representatives.
Ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the Cherokee Nation, and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate.
A group of Cherokees petitioned in protest of the proposed removal, though this wasn't taken up by the Supreme Court or the U.S. Congress, in part due to delays and timing.
The treaty was enforced by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's successor,  <START:person> Van Buren <END> , who sent 7,000 troops to carry out the relocation policy.
Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began.
It was subsequent to this that as many as 4,000 Cherokees died on the "Trail of Tears".
By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.
All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves.
Their methods earned them the title of the "Five Civilized Tribes".
More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's administration, though a few Cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high Smoky Mountains along the North Carolina and Tennessee border.
Initiated reforms.
BEP engraved portrait of  <START:person> Jackson <END>  as President.
In an effort to purge the government from corruption of previous administrations,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments.
During  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's tenure in office, large amounts of public money were put in the hands of public officials.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , who believed appointees should be hired by merit, withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Postmaster  <START:person> Barry <END>  resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  replaced  <START:person> Barry <END>  with  <START:person> Amos Kendall <END> , who went on to implement much needed reforms in the Postal Service.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  repeatedly called for the abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President.
In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term.
So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress."
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's time in the presidency as saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents.
The Service Pension Act of 1832, for instance, provided pensions to veterans “even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need,” while an Act of July 1836 enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband’s pensions.
Rotation in office and spoils system.
Upon assuming the presidency in 1829  <START:person> Jackson <END>  enforced the "Tenure of Office Act", passed earlier into law by President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  declared that rotation of appointments in political office was "a leading principle in the republican creed".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  noted, "In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy.
Opposed to this view however, were  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members.
In practice, this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists.
The number of federal office holders removed by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  were exaggerated by his opponents;  <START:person> Jackson <END>  only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , however, did use his image and presidential power to award his loyal Democratic Party followers by granting them federal office appointments.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's democratic approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office.
Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership  <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated "If he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me."
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's rotation of office theory generated what was later to be called the spoils system, a practice that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  never personally justified.
The political realities of Washington, however, did in the end force  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations.
Historians believe that  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics.
Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington proved to be difficult such as the New York Customs House, the Postal Service, the Departments of Navy and War, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades.
Other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices, forced political party campaign participation, and collection of assessments, did not take place until after  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency.
During  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency, those in opposition to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's purging of office holders, formed the Whig Party, calling  <START:person> Jackson <END>  "King  <START:person> Andrew <END>  I" having feared his military background, and named their party after the English paliamentary Whigs who opposed eighteenth century British monarchy.
Nullification crisis.
Another notable crisis during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's period of office was the "Nullification Crisis", or "secession crisis", of 1828 – 1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs.
Critics alleged that high tariffs (the "Tariff of Abominations") on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South.
Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.
The issue came to a head when Vice President  <START:person> Calhoun <END> , in the South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, South Carolina, that it had the right to "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests.
Although  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  attempted to face down  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.
Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts.
 <START:person> Robert Hayne <END>  began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!"
– a clear challenge to  <START:person> Calhoun <END> .
 <START:person> Calhoun <END>  clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"
At the first Democratic National Convention, which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet,  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  broke from each other politically and  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  replaced  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  as  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's running mate in the 1832 presidential election.
In December 1832,  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.
In response to South Carolina's nullification claim,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  vowed to send troops to South Carolina to enforce the laws.
In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers", stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed".
South Carolina, the President declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution ... forms a "government" not a league ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  asked Congress to pass a "Force Bill" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by  <START:person> Clay <END>  agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff.
The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed both.
The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance.
The Force  <START:person> Bill <END>  became moot because it was no longer needed.
On May 1, 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and disunion and southern confederacy the real object.
The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question."
Foreign affairs.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took office in 1829 spoliation claims, or compensation demands for the capture of American ships and sailors, dating from the Napoleonic era, caused strained relations between the U.S. and French governments.
The French Navy had captured and sent American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules.
According to Secretary of State  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  the relations between the U.S. and France was "hopeless".
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Minister to France  <START:person> William C. Rives <END> , however, through diplomacy was able to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on July 4, 1831 that would award the U.S. ₣ 25,000,000 ($5,000,000) in damages.
The French government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties.
The French king  <START:person> Louis Philippe <END>  I and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies.
By 1834 the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's ire and he became impatient.
In his December 1834 State of the Union address  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was "wholly disappointed" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France.
Feeling insulted by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's words the French people demanded an apology.
In his December 1835 State of the Union Address  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment.
The French government accepted  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's statements as sincere and in February 1836 American reparations were finally paid.
In addition to France, the  <START:person> Jackson <END>  administration successfully settled spoliation claims with Denmark, Portugal, and Spain.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with Russia, Spain, Turkey, Great Britain, and Siam.
Under the treaty of Great Britain American trade was reopened in the West Indies.
The trade agreement with Siam was Americas first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country.
As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , however, was unsuccessful in opening trade with China and Japan.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's agent in Texas, Colonel  <START:person> Anthony Butler <END> , suggested to take Texas over militarily but  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused.
 <START:person> Butler <END>  was later replaced toward the end of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency.
Bank veto and Election of 1832.
In 1816 the Second Bank of the United States was charted by President  <START:person> James Madison <END>  to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812.
In 1823 President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  appointed  <START:person> Nicholas Biddle <END> , the Bank's third and last executive, to run the bank.
In January 1832  <START:person> Biddle <END> , on advice from his friends, submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter four years before the original 20 year charter was to end.
 <START:person> Biddle <END> 's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , believing that Bank was fundamentally a corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners, vetoed the bill.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated the Bank made "the rich richer and the potent more powerful."
The National Republican Party immediately made  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto of the Bank a political issue attempting to undermine  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's political opponents castigated  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto as "the very slang of the leveller and demagogue" believing  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.
During the 1832 Presidential Election the rechartering of the Second National Bank became the primary issue.
The election also demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period.
The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, in May 1832 nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  of Tennessee and  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  of New York.
The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , senator from Kentucky and former Speaker of the House, and  <START:person> John Sergeant <END>  of Pennsylvania.
The Anti-Mason party, who had earlier held their convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated  <START:person> William Wirt <END>  of Maryland and  <START:person> Amos Elmaker <END>  of Pennsylvania; both  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Clay <END>  were masons.
The two rival parties, however, proved to be no match for  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity and the Democratic Party's strong political networks known as "Hickory Clubs" in state and local organization.
Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D.C.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  won the election decisively by a landslide receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes.
 <START:person> Clay <END>  received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes.
 <START:person> Wirt <END>  received only 8 percent of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party folded.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.
Removal of deposits and censure.
In 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  removed federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation.
Three years later,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  issued the Specie Circular, an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins).
The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes, causing the Panic of 1837, which threw the national economy into a deep depression.
It took years for the economy to recover from the damage, however the bulk of the damage was blamed on  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , who took office in 1837.
Whitehouse.gov notes, Basically the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of "boom and bust," which was following its regular pattern, but  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's financial measures contributed to the crash.
His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy bank credit, had swept the West.
To end this speculation,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with hard money--gold or silver.
In 1837 the panic began.
Hundreds of banks and businesses failed.
Thousands lost their lands.
For about five years the United States was wracked by the worst depression thus far in its history.—"Whitehouse.gov" official biography of  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  The U.S. Senate censured  <START:person> Jackson <END>  on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States.
The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Jackson-rival Senator  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
During the proceedings preceding the censure,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  called  <START:person> Clay <END>  "reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel", and the issue was highly divisive within the Senate, however the censure was approved 26–20 on March 28.
When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  supporters, led by  <START:person> Thomas Hart Benton <END> , who though he had once shot  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in a street fight, eventually became an ardent supporter of the president.
Attack and assassination attempt.
The first recorded physical attack on a U.S. president was directed at  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had ordered the dismissal of  <START:person> Robert B. Randolph <END>  from the navy for embezzlement.
On May 6, 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sailed on USS "Cygnet" to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of  <START:person> Mary Ball Washington <END> ,  <START:person> George Washington <END> 's mother.
During a stopover near Alexandria,  <START:person> Randolph <END>  appeared and struck the President.
He fled the scene chased by several members of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's party, including the well-known writer  <START:person> Washington Irving <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  decided not to press charges.
On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative  <START:person> Warren R. Davis <END> ,  <START:person> Richard Lawrence <END> , an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired.
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired.
Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring.
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  was restrained, and legend says that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  attacked  <START:person> Lawrence <END>  with his cane.
Others present, including  <START:person> David Crockett <END> , restrained and disarmed  <START:person> Lawrence <END> .
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  told doctors later his reasons for the shooting.
He blamed  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for the loss of his job.
He claimed that with the President dead, "money would be more plenty" (a reference to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell".
Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King—specifically,  <START:person> Richard III <END> , dead since 1485—and that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was his clerk.
He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.
Afterwards, due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested.
Each time they performed perfectly.
Many believed that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had been protected by the same Providence that they believed also protected their young nation.
The incident became a part of the Jacksonian mythos.
Slavery controversies.
Anti-slavery tracts.
During the summer of 1835, controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation, as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819-1820 Missouri Compromise debates.
Northern abolitionists were sending anti-slavery tracts through the U.S. Postal system into the South.
Pro slavery Southerners objected believing the tracts were "incendiary literature" and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti-slavery tracts into the South.
On July 29, a mob of 300 conservatives broke into the Post Office in Charleston, South Carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts.
The Jackson Administration had Southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism.
However,  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who demanded sectional peace, desired to placate Southerners; at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of Northern Democrats.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Postmaster General  <START:person> Amos Kendall <END>  gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  angrily denounced Northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , who wanted the matter quickly resolved, also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers.
In February 1836, Senator  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's former Vice President, authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti-slavery tracts via the federal mail service.
The bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the House.
Many Southern postmasters, however, disregarded matters of federal law and simply refused to send the anti-slavery tracts.
Anti-slavery Congressional petitions.
In the same year another controversy took place, when abolitionists sent the U.S. House of Representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in Washington D.C.
This infuriated pro-slavery Southerners, who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions.
On December 18, 1835 South Carolina congressman  <START:person> James H. Hammond <END>  strongly denounced abolitionists as "ignorant fanatics".
Northern Whigs objected that anti-slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly.
South Carolina Representative  <START:person> Henry L. Pinckney <END>  drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as "sickly sentimentality", declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery, and tabled ("gag rule") all further anti-slavery petitions.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  leaders in Congress supported the measure, which was passed quickly and without any debate; temporarily suppressing pro-abolitionist activities in Congress.
Recognition of Republic of Texas.
In 1835, pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government; by May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military for the time being, establishing an independent Republic of Texas.
The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and annexation into the United States.
However,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was hesitant with recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election.
The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, while Democratic candidate  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  was elected President.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating a chargé d'affaires on the last day of his Presidency, March 3, 1837.
U.S. Exploring Expedition.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  initially opposed any federal exploration scientific expeditions during his first term in office.
The last scientific federally funded exploration expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led by  <START:person> Stephen H. Harriman <END>  on the Red River of the North.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's predecessor  <START:person> John Q. Adams <END>  attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration expedition in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  assumed office in 1829 he pocketed  <START:person> Adam <END> 's expedition plans.
However, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END>  and the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  and Clark Expedition,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term.
On May 18, 1836  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed a law creating and funding the oceanic United States Exploring Expedition.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  put Secretary of Navy  <START:person> Mahlon Dickerson <END>  in charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's term of office expired.
 <START:person> Dickerson <END>  however proved unfit for the task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, under the next President,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> .
One Brig ship, the USS "Porpoise", later used in the expedition; having been laid down, built, and commissioned by Secretary  <START:person> Dickerson <END>  in May 1836, circumnavigated the world, explored and mapped the Southern Ocean, confirming the existence of the Antarctica continent.
Panic of 1837.
The national economy during the 1830s was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills.
In January 1835,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished.
However, reckless speculation in land and railroads caused what became known as the Panic of 1837.
Contributing factors included  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused Western Banks to relax their lending standards.
Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837, the Specie Circular, that mandated Western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, that transferred federal monies from Eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's "Specie Circular", although designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, led many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver.
The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States.
As a result the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased.
The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound.
Judicial appointments.
In total  <START:person> Jackson <END>  appointed 24 federal judges: six Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States and eighteen judges to the United States district courts.
Later life and death.
After serving two terms as president,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  retired to his Hermitage plantation in 1837.
He immediately began putting the Hermitage in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son,  <START:person> Andrew Jr <END> .
Although he suffered ill health,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  remained influential in both national and state politics.
He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, "I will die with the Union."
Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  to repudiate the "Specie Circular".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  died at his plantation on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic tuberculosis, dropsy, and heart failure.
According to a newspaper account from the "Boon Lick Times" read, "[he] fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed ... but he subsequently revived ... Gen.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  died at the Hermitage at 6 o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant.
When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach.
He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live."
In his will,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  left his entire estate to his adopted son,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members.
Family and personal life.
Shortly after  <START:person> Jackson <END>  first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with  <START:person> Rachel Stockley Donelson <END> , the widow of  <START:person> John Donelson <END> .
Here  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became acquainted with their daughter,  <START:person> Rachel Donelson Robards <END> .
At the time,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  was in an unhappy marriage with Captain  <START:person> Lewis Robards <END> ; he was subject to fits of jealous rage.
The two were separated in 1790.
According to  <START:person> Jackson <END> , he married  <START:person> Rachel <END>  after hearing that  <START:person> Robards <END>  had obtained a divorce.
However, the divorce had never been completed, making  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's marriage to  <START:person> Jackson <END>  bigamous and therefore invalid.
After the divorce was officially completed,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  remarried in 1794.
To complicate matters further, evidence shows that  <START:person> Rachel <END>  had been living with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and referred to herself as Mrs.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  before the petition for divorce was ever made.
It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.
The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor.
By May 1806,  <START:person> Charles Dickinson <END>  had published an attack on  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to a duel.
Since  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  was considered an expert shot,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  determined it would be best to let  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness;  <START:person> Jackson <END>  would wait and take careful aim at  <START:person> Dickinson <END> .
 <START:person> Dickinson <END>  did fire first, hitting  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the chest.
Under the rules of dueling,  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  had to remain still as  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took aim and shot and killed him.
However, the bullet that struck  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled  <START:person> Jackson <END>  with a reputation as a fearful, violent, vengeful man.
He became a social outcast.
 <START:person> Rachel <END>  died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took office as President.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  described her symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast."
After struggling for three days,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  finally died; a distraught  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body.
She had been under extreme stress during the election, and she never did well when  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was away at war or work.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  blamed  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END>  for  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's death because the Whig campaign of 1828 had repeatedly attacked the circumstances for  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's wedding to  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave  <START:person> Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had three adopted sons:  <START:person> Theodore <END> , an Indian about whom little is known,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , the son of  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's brother  <START:person> Severn Donelson <END> , and  <START:person> Lyncoya <END> , a Creek Indian orphan adopted by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  after the Creek War.
 <START:person> Lyncoya <END>  died of tuberculosis in 1828, at the age of sixteen.
The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children.
 <START:person> John Samuel Donelson <END> ,  <START:person> Daniel Smith Donelson <END>  and  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Donelson <END>  were the sons of  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's brother  <START:person> Samuel Donelson <END> , who died in 1804.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson Hutchings <END>  was  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's orphaned grand nephew.
 <START:person> Caroline Butler <END> ,  <START:person> Eliza Butler <END> ,  <START:person> Edward Butler <END> , and  <START:person> Anthony Butler <END>  were the orphaned children of  <START:person> Edward Butler <END> , a family friend.
They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.
The widower  <START:person> Jackson <END>  invited  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's niece  <START:person> Emily Donelson <END>  to serve as host at the White House.
 <START:person> Emily <END>  was married to  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Donelson <END> , who acted as  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the American Party ticket.
The relationship between the President and  <START:person> Emily <END>  became strained during the Petticoat affair, and the two became estranged for over a year.
They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House host.
 <START:person> Sarah Yorke Jackson <END> , the wife of  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , became co-host of the White House in 1834.
It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady.
 <START:person> Sarah <END>  took over all hosting duties after  <START:person> Emily <END>  died from tuberculosis in 1836.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used Rip Raps as a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.
Temperament.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's quick temper was notorious.
Brands says, "His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him and defamed even his wife,  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
He dueled in her defense and his own, suffering grievous wounds that left him with bullet fragments lodged about his body."
However,  <START:person> Remini <END>  is of the opinion that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs.
Brands also notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper: On the last day of the presidency,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  or to hang  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ."
Physical appearance.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a lean figure, standing at 6 feet, 1 inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64 kg) on average.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61.
He had penetrating deep blue eyes.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake.
Religious faith.
About a year after retiring the presidency,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a Freemason, having been initiated at Masonic Lodge, Harmony No. 1 in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee.
He was the only U.S. president to have been a Grandmaster of a State Lodge until  <START:person> Harry S. Truman <END>  in 1945.
His Masonic apron is on display in the Tennessee State Museum.
An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  on U.S. postage.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on U.S. Postage more than the usual two or three times.
He died in 1845, but the U.S. Post Office did not release a postage stamp in his honor until 18 years after his death, with the issue of 1863, a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the 'Black Jack'.
In contrast, the first  <START:person> Warren G. Harding <END>  stamp was released only one month after his death,  <START:person> Lincoln <END> , one year exactly.
As  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait.
In all,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  has appeared on thirteen different U.S. postage stamps, more than that of most U.S. presidents; only Washington,  <START:person> Lincoln <END> , and  <START:person> Franklin <END>  (who was not a president) have appeared more often.
During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two Confederate postage stamps bearing  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's portrait, one a and the other a , both issued in 1863.
Popular culture depictions.
The actor  <START:person> Hugh Sothern <END>  played the character of General  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  in the 1938 film "The Buccaneer", and  <START:person> Charlton Heston <END>  played  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  in the 1953 film, "The President's Lady" and the 1958 film, "The Buccaneer".
 <START:person> Basil Ruysdael <END>  played  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in Walt Disney's 1955 " <START:person> Davy Crockett <END> " TV miniseries and subsequent film release.

auto; font-size:95%;clear:both;"  Affix  An affix (in modern sense) is a morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word.
Affixes may be derivational, like English "-ness" and "pre-", or inflectional, like English plural "-s" and past tense "-ed".
They are bound morphemes by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be separable affixes.
Affixation is, thus, the linguistic process speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.
Positional categories of affixes.
Affixes are divided into plenty of categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem.
"Prefix" and "suffix" are extremely common terms.
"Infix" and "circumfix" are less so, as they are not important in European languages.
The other terms are uncommon.
"Prefix" and "suffix" may be subsumed under the term "adfix" in contrast to "infix."
When marking text for interlinear glossing, as in the third column in the chart above, simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens.
Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets.
Reduplication is often shown with a tilde.
Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash.
Lexical affixes.
"Lexical affixes" (or "semantic affixes") are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as incorporated nouns within verbs and as elements of compound nouns.
In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form.
Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.
Lexical affixes are relatively rare.
The Wakashan, Salishan, and Chimakuan languages all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest of the North America.
The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings.
Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of Northern Straits Saanich written in the Saanich orthography and in Americanist notation: Lexical suffixes when compared with free nouns often have a more generic or general meaning.
For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such "saltwater", "whitewater", etc.).
In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become grammaticalized to various degrees.
Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs.
Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic arguments just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns.
 <START:person> Gerdts <END>  (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the Halkomelem language (the word order here is verb–subject–object): In sentence (1), the verb "wash" is šak’ʷətəs where šak’ʷis the root and -ət and -əs are inflectional suffixes.
The subject "the woman" is łə słeniʔ and the object "the baby" is łə qeq.
In this sentence, "the baby" is a free noun.
(The niʔ here is an auxiliary, which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)
In sentence (2), "baby" does not appear as a free noun.
Instead it appears as the lexical suffix -əyəł which is affixed to the verb root šk’ʷ(which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here).
Note how the lexical suffix is neither "the baby" (definite) nor "a baby" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.
Orthographic affixes.
In orthography, the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters.
For example,  <START:person> Maya <END>  glyphs are generally compounds of a "main sign" and smaller "affixes" joined at its margins.
These are called "prefixes, superfixes, postfixes," and "subfixes" according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph.
A small glyph placed inside another is called an "infix."
Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the Indic alphabets.
For example, the Tibetan alphabet utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.

</dl>   <START:person> Augustin-Louis Cauchy  Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy <END>  (]; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician reputed as a pioneer of analysis.
He was one of the first to state and prove theorems of calculus rigorously, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors.
He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra.
A profound mathematician,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors.
His writings range widely in mathematics and mathematical physics.
"More concepts and theorems have been named for  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy)."
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks.
He was a devout Roman Catholic, strict Bourbon royalist, and a close associate of the Jesuit order.
Biography.
Youth and education.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was the son of  <START:person> Louis François Cauchy <END>  (1760–1848) and  <START:person> Marie-Madeleine Desestre <END> .
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had two brothers,  <START:person> Alexandre Laurent Cauchy <END>  (1792–1857), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and  <START:person> Eugene François Cauchy <END>  (1802–1877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  married  <START:person> Aloise de Bure <END>  in 1818.
She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's works.
By her he had two daughters,  <START:person> Marie Françoise Alicia <END>  (1819) and  <START:person> Marie Mathilde <END>  (1823).
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's father ( <START:person> Louis François Cauchy <END> ) was a high official in the Parisian Police of the New Régime.
He lost his position because of the French Revolution (July 14, 1789) that broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born.
The  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  family survived the revolution and the following Reign of Terror (1794) by escaping to Arcueil, where  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  received his first education, from his father.
After the execution of Robespierre (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris.
There  <START:person> Louis-François Cauchy <END>  found himself a new bureaucratic job, and quickly moved up the ranks.
When  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END>  came to power (1799),  <START:person> Louis-François Cauchy <END>  was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under Laplace (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics).
The famous mathematician Lagrange was also no stranger in the  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  family.
On Lagrange's advice,  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  was enrolled in the École Centrale du Panthéon, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802.
Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and Humanities.
In spite of these successes,  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the École Polytechnique.
In 1805 he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam, and he was admitted.
One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education.
The school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting.
Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the École des Ponts et Chaussées (School for Bridges and Roads).
He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors.

After finishing school in 1810,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where  <START:person> Napoleon <END>  intended to build a naval base.
Here  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  stayed for three years, and although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the "Première Classe" (First Class) of the Institut de France.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's first two manuscripts (on polyhedra) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of conic sections) was rejected.
In September 1812, now 23 years old, after becoming ill from overwork,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  returned to Paris.
Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position.
Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior.
The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric functions, the symmetric group and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations).
He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815.
In 1815  <START:person> Napoleon <END>  was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king  <START:person> Louis XVIII <END>  took the restoration in hand.
The Académie des Sciences was re-established in March 1816;  <START:person> Lazare Carnot <END>  and  <START:person> Gaspard Monge <END>  were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them.
The reaction by  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's peers was harsh; they considered his acceptance of membership of the Academy an outrage, and  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  thereby created many enemies in scientific circles.
Professor at École Polytechnique.
In November 1815,  <START:person> Louis Poinsot <END> , who was an associate professor at the École Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship.
One of his great successes at that time was the proof of  <START:person> Fermat <END> 's polygonal number theorem.
However, the fact that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons, doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot.
He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the École Polytechnique.
In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was promoted to full professor.
When  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents.
His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride,  <START:person> Aloïse de Bure <END> , five years his junior.
The  <START:person> de Bure <END>  family were printers and booksellers, and published most of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's works.
 <START:person> Aloïse <END>  and  <START:person> Augustin <END>  were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice.
In 1819 the couple's first daughter,  <START:person> Marie Françoise Alicia <END> , was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter,  <START:person> Marie Mathilde <END> .
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had two brothers:  <START:person> Alexandre Laurent Cauchy <END> , who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and  <START:person> Eugène François Cauchy <END> , a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.
The conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  perfectly.
In 1824  <START:person> Louis XVIII <END>  died, and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
During these years  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another.
He received cross appointments at the Collège de France, and the Faculté des Sciences of the University.
In exile.
In July 1830 France underwent another revolution.
 <START:person> Charles X <END>  fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king  <START:person> Louis-Philippe <END>  (of the House of Orléans).
Riots, in which uniformed students of the École Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's home in Paris.
These events marked a turning point in  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> , shaken by the fall of the government, and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind.
He spent a short time at Fribourg in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime.
He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required.
In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the King of Sardinia (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him.
He taught in Turin during 1832–1833.
In 1831, he had been elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
In August 1833  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  left Turin for Prague, to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old  <START:person> Duke of Bordeaux Henri d'Artois <END>  (1820–1883), the exiled Crown  <START:person> Prince <END>  and grandson of  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
As a professor of the École Polytechnique,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material.
The young  <START:person> Duke <END>  had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch.
Although  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.
During his civil engineering days,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of telling his pupil this; with great malice, the young  <START:person> Duke <END>  went about saying that Mister  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  started his career in the sewers of Paris.
His role as tutor lasted until the  <START:person> Duke <END>  became eighteen years old, in September 1838.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics.
The only good that came out of this episode was  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's promotion to  <START:person> Baron <END> , a title that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  set great store by.
In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was finally reunited with his family, after four years of exile.
Last years.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838.
He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance.
However, he desperately wanted to regain a formal position in Parisian science.
In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau des Longitudes.
This Bureau had some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members.
Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could "forget" about the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it.
The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea – mainly the longitudinal coordinate, since latitude is easily determined from the position of the sun.
Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.
In November 1839  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with.
Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election.
For four years  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers.
Still  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics.
In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy.
He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by  <START:person> John Colson <END> .
The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was finally replaced by  <START:person> Poinsot <END> .
Throughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of Church and State.
After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally.
He lent his prestige and knowledge to the École Normale Écclésiastique, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges.
He also took part in the founding of the Institut Catholique.
The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France.
These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who, on the whole, supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution.
When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Collège de France in 1843,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  applied for it, but got just three out of 45 votes.
The year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France.
King  <START:person> Louis-Philippe <END> , fearful of sharing the fate of  <START:person> Louis XVI <END> , fled to England.
The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy.
On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Faculté de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy.
After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of  <START:person> Louis Napoleon Bonaparte <END> , nephew of  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END> , and son of  <START:person> Napoleon <END> 's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland.
Soon (early 1852) the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name  <START:person> Napoleon III <END> .
Not unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors.
Not always does history repeat itself, however, because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67.
He received the Last Rites and died at 4 a.m. on May 23, 1857.
His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.
Work.
Early work.
The genius of  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was illustrated in his simple solution of the problem of Apollonius—describing a circle touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of  <START:person> Euler <END> 's formula on polyhedra in 1811, and in several other elegant problems.
More important is his memoir on wave propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series, where he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series.
In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers.
He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.
Wave theory, mechanics, elasticity.
In the theory of light he worked on Fresnel's wave theory and on the dispersion and polarization of light.
He also contributed significant research in mechanics, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter.
He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media.
He introduced a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the Cauchy stress tensor.
In elasticity, he originated the theory of stress, and his results are nearly as valuable as those of  <START:person> Siméon Poisson <END> .
Number theory.
Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the  <START:person> Fermat <END>  polygonal number theorem.
Complex functions.
Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory.
The first pivotal theorem proved by  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , now known as "Cauchy's integral theorem", was the following: where "f"("z") is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve "C" (contour) lying in the complex plane.
The "contour integral" is taken along the contour "C".
The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  presented to the Académie des Sciences (then still called "First Class of the Institute") on August 11, 1814.
In full form the theorem was given in 1825.
The 1825 paper is seen by many as  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's most important contribution to mathematics.
In 1826  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  gave a formal definition of a residue of a function.
This concept regards functions that have poles—isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity.
If the complex-valued function "f"("z") can be expanded in the neighborhood of a singularity "a" as where φ("z") is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then "f" is said to have a pole of order "n" in the point "a".
If "n" = 1, the pole is called simple.
The coefficient "B"1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function "f" at "a".
If "f" is non-singular at "a" then the residue of "f" is zero at "a".
Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to, where we replaced "B"1 by the modern notation of the residue.
In 1831, while in Turin,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin.
In the first he proposed the formula now known as  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's integral formula, where "f"("z") is analytic on "C" and within the region bounded by the contour "C" and the complex number "a" is somewhere in this region.
The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise.
Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at "z" = "a".
In the second paper he presented the residue theorem, where the sum is over all the "n" poles of "f"("z") on and within the contour "C".
These results of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers.
For quite some time, contemporaries of  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated.
Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with  <START:person> Pierre-Alphonse Laurent <END>  being the first mathematician, besides  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , making a substantial contribution (his Laurent series published in 1843).
Cours d'Analyse.
In his book "Cours d'Analyse"  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  stressed the importance of rigor in analysis.
"Rigor" in this case meant the rejection of the principle of "Generality of algebra" (of earlier authors such as  <START:person> Euler <END>  and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and infinitesimals.
 <START:person> Judith Grabiner <END>  wrote  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was "the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe."
The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and formula_6 arguments were introduced into Calculus.
Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: "The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself."
 <START:person> M. Barany <END>  claims that the École mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's better judgement .
 <START:person> Gilain <END>  notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to "Analyse Algébrique" was reduced in 1825,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus.
 <START:person> Laugwitz <END>  (1989) and  <START:person> Benis-Sinaceur <END>  (1973) point out that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero.
There has been a vast body of literature written about  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's notion of "infinitesimally small quantities", arguing they lead from everything from the usual "epsilontic" definitions or to the notions of non-standard analysis.
The consensus is that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used.
 <START:person> Taylor <END> 's theorem.
He was the first to prove  <START:person> Taylor <END> 's theorem rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder.
He wrote a textbook (see the illustration) for his students at the École Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible.
In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught.
Also  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book: Cauchy condensation test.
In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook.
In spite of these,  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods; thus one of his theorems was exposed to a "counter-example" by  <START:person> Abel <END> , later fixed by the introduction of the notion of uniform continuity.
Argument principle, stability.
In a paper published in 1855, two years before  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the "Argument Principle" in many modern textbooks on complex analysis.
In modern control theory textbooks, the Cauchy argument principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist stability criterion, which can be used to predict the stability of negative feedback amplifier and negative feedback control systems.
Thus  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.
Output.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was very productive, in number of papers second only to  <START:person> Leonhard Euler <END> .
It took almost a century to collect all his writings into 27 large volumes: His greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced; these are mainly embodied in his three great treatises: His other works include: Politics and religious beliefs.
 <START:person> Augustin-Louis Cauchy <END>  grew up in the house of a staunch royalist.
This made his father flee with the family to Arcueil during the French Revolution.
Their life there during that time was apparently hard;  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END> 's father,  <START:person> Louis François <END> , spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period.
A paragraph from an undated letter from  <START:person> Louis François <END>  to his mother in Rouen says: We never had more than a half pound of bread — and sometimes not even that.
This we supplement with little supply of hard crackers and rice that we are allotted.
Otherwise, we are getting along quite well, which is the important thing and goes to show that human beings can get by with little.
I should tell you that for my children's pap I still have a bit of fine flour, made from wheat that I grew on my own land.
I had three bushels, and I also have a few pounds of potato starch.
It is as white as snow and very good, too, especially for very young children.
It, too, was grown on my own land.
In any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
He was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint  <START:person> Vincent de Paul <END> .
He also had links to the Society of  <START:person> Jesus <END>  and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so.
His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for  <START:person> Charles Hermite <END>  during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic.
It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Potato Famine.
His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues.
He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed.
 <START:person> Niels Henrik Abel <END>  called him a "bigoted Catholic" and added he was "mad and there is nothing that can be done about him", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when  <START:person> Guglielmo Libri Carucci <END>  dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause.
When  <START:person> Libri <END>  was accused of stealing books he was replaced by  <START:person> Joseph Liouville <END>  rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy.
Another dispute with political overtones concerned  <START:person> Jean Marie Constant Duhamel <END>  and a claim on inelastic shocks.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was later shown, by  <START:person> Jean-Victor Poncelet <END> , to be wrong.
Aimery of Jerusalem  Aimery (Latin "Aimericus"; 1145 – 1 April 1205), born  <START:person> Aimery <END>  of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> , was the first King of Cyprus (1194–1205) and tenth King of Jerusalem (1197–1205).
He was an older brother of  <START:person> Guy of Lusignan <END> .
Older scholarship mistook the names Aimery and  <START:person> Amalric <END>  ( <START:person> Amaury <END> ) as variant spellings of the same name, so these historians erroneously added numbers for kings  <START:person> Amalric <END>  I (1163–74) and  <START:person> Amalric II <END>  (actually Aimery).
Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king.
Confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries.
The  <START:person> Lusignan <END>  family was noted for its many Crusaders.
Aimery and Guy were sons of  <START:person> Hugh VIII <END>  of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> , who had himself campaigned in the Holy Land in the 1160s.
After being expelled from Poitou by their overlord,  <START:person> Richard <END>  the Lion-hearted, for the murder of  <START:person> Patrick <END>  of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury,  <START:person> Aimery <END>  arrived in Palestine c. 1174, Guy possibly later.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  married  <START:person> Eschiva <END> , daughter of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  of Ibelin.
He then took service with  <START:person> Agnes of Courtenay <END> , wife of  <START:person> Reginald <END>  of Sidon and mother of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  IV of Jerusalem.
The pro-Ibelin "Chronicle of Ernoul" later claimed that he was her lover, but it is likely that she and  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  IV were attempting to separate him from the political influence of his wife's family.
He was appointed Constable of Jerusalem soon after 22 April 1179.
 <START:person> Guy <END>  married the king's widowed older sister, Sibylla of Jerusalem in 1180, and so gained a claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  was among those captured with his brother after the disastrous  <START:person> Battle of Hattin <END>  in 1187.
In 1194, on the death of Guy, he became King of Cyprus.
By his first wife,  <START:person> Eschiva <END>  of  <START:person> Ibelin <END> , he was the father of  <START:person> Hugh <END>  I of Cyprus and was crowned in Nicosia on 22 September 1197.
After  <START:person> Eschiva <END> 's death in October 1197 he married  <START:person> Isabella <END> , the daughter of  <START:person> Amalric <END>  of Jerusalem by his second marriage, and became King of Jerusalem in right of his wife and was crowned at Acre in January 1198.
This was only possible, because the candidacy for the crown of  <START:person> Aimery <END> , who was a vassal of Roman-German Emperor  <START:person> Henry <END>  VI., was supported by the German crusaders.
In 1198, at the end of the Crusade of 1197, he was able to procure a five years' truce with the Muslims, owing to the struggle between  <START:person> Saladin <END> 's brothers and his sons for the inheritance of his territories.
The truce was disturbed by raids on both sides, but in 1204 it was renewed for six years.
Many members of the royal family died in rapid succession in early 1205, including  <START:person> Aimery <END>  himself.
 <START:person> Aimery <END> 's two older sons, Guy and John, boys of about eight years of age, died early in 1205.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  died of dysentery (allegedly brought on by "a surfeit of white mullet") or even poisoned at Saint Jean d'Acre on 1 April 1205, just after his son  <START:person> Aimery <END>  and four days before his wife, and was buried at Saint Sophia, Nicosia.
The kingdom of Cyprus passed to  <START:person> Hugh <END> , his only surviving son, while the Kingdom of Jerusalem passed to  <START:person> Maria <END> , the daughter of  <START:person> Isabella <END>  by her previous marriage with  <START:person> Conrad of Montferrat <END> .
Wives and children.
His first wife, married before 29 October 1174, was Eschiva of Ibelin (c.
1160 – Cyprus in Winter 1196–1197), daughter of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  of Ibelin and first wife  <START:person> Richilde de Bethsan <END>  or  <START:person> Bessan <END> .
They had six children: His second wife was  <START:person> Queen Isabella <END>  of Jerusalem, married January 1198 in Acre.
They had three children:   <START:person> Ambroise  Ambroise <END> , sometimes  <START:person> Ambroise <END>  of Normandy, (flourished c. 1190) was a  <START:person> Norman <END>  poet and chronicler of the Third Crusade, author of a work called "L'Estoire de la guerre sainte", which describes in rhyming Old French verse the adventures of  <START:person> Richard Coeur de Lion <END>  as a crusader.
The poem is known to us only through one Vatican manuscript, and long escaped the notice of historians.
The credit for detecting its value belongs to  <START:person> Gaston Paris <END> , although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the "Monumenta Germaniae Historica", who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885).
 <START:person> Ambroise <END>  followed  <START:person> Richard <END>  I as a noncombatant, and not improbably as a court-minstrel.
He speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at Messina, in Cyprus, at the siege of Acre, and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.
 <START:person> Ambroise <END>  is surprisingly accurate in his chronology; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his pilgrimage.
He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention.
He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the Saracens, against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the "Polein" party which supported  <START:person> Conrad <END>  of Montferrat against Guy of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> .
He is rather to be treated as a biographer than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects.
Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190–1192 in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
Books 2–6 of the "Itinerarium Regis Ricardi", a Latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by  <START:person> Richard <END> , a canon of Holy Trinity, London, are closely related to  <START:person> Ambroise <END> 's poem.
They were formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which  <START:person> Ambroise <END>  based his work, but that can no longer be maintained.
American English  American English, or U.S. English, is a set of dialects of the English language used mostly in the United States.
Approximately two-thirds of the world's native speakers of English live in the U.S. The variety of American English that is considered by many speakers to be the most free from regional, ethnic, or cultural distinctions is the dialect known as General American.
English is the most widely spoken language in the United States.
English is the common language used by the federal government and is considered the "de facto" language of the country because of its widespread use.
English has been given official status by 30 of the 50 state governments.
As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States District Court for the territory.
The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization.
The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Since then, American English has been influenced by the languages of West Africa, the Native American population, German, Irish, Spanish, and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the U.S. Phonology.
Compared with English as spoken in England, North American English is more homogeneous.
Some distinctive accents can be found on the East Coast (for example, in eastern New England, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore) partly because these areas were in close contact with England and imitated prestigious varieties of English at a time when these were undergoing changes.
In addition, many speech communities on the East Coast have existed in their present locations for centuries, while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing United States and developed a far more general linguistic pattern.
Studies on historical usage of English in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply evolve from period British English, but rather retained many archaic features contemporary British English has since lost.
Most North American speech is rhotic, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was rhotic.
Rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of Hiberno-English, West Country English and Scottish English.
In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter "r" is a postalveolar approximant [ɹ̠] or retroflex approximant [ɻ] rather than a trill or a tap (as often heard, for example, in Scotland or India).
A unique "bunched tongue" variant of the approximant "r" sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.
The loss of syllable-final "r" in North America, known as non-rhoticity, is confined mostly to the accents of eastern New England, New York City and surrounding areas and the coastal portions of the South, and African American Vernacular English.
In rural tidewater Virginia and eastern New England, 'r' is non-rhotic in accented (such as "bird", "work", "first", "birthday") as well as unaccented syllables, although this is declining among the younger generation of speakers.
Dropping of syllable-final "r" sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if "r" is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant (for example, many North Americans drop the first 'r' in "particular").
In England, the lost "r" was often changed into [ə] (schwa), giving rise to a new class of falling diphthongs.
Furthermore, the "er" sound of "fur or "butter, is realized in AmE as a monophthongal r-colored vowel (stressed [ɝ] or unstressed [ɚ] as represented in the IPA).
This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech.
Some other English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate: On the other hand, North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of English speech: Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include: Vocabulary.
North America has given the English lexicon many thousands of words, meanings, and phrases.
Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally.
Creation of an American lexicon.
The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the Native American languages.
Examples of such names are "opossum, raccoon, squash" and "moose" (from Algonquian).
Other Native American loanwords, such as "wigwam" or "moccasin", describe articles in common use among Native Americans.
The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, "cookie", "cruller", "stoop", and "pit" (of a fruit) from Dutch; "angst, kindergarten, sauerkraut" from German, "levee, portage" ("carrying of boats or goods") and (probably) "gopher" from French; "barbecue, stevedore, and rodeo" from Spanish.
Among the earliest and most notable regular "English" additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, "run, branch, fork, snag, bluff, gulch, neck" (of the woods), "barrens, bottomland, notch, knob, riffle, rapids, watergap, cutoff, trail, timberline" and "divide".
Already existing words such as "creek, slough, sleet" and (in later use) "watershed" received new meanings that were unknown in England.
Other noteworthy American toponyms are found among loanwords; for example, "prairie, butte" (French); "bayou" (Choctaw via Louisiana French); "coulee" (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); "canyon, mesa, arroyo" (Spanish); "vlei, skate, kill" (Dutch, Hudson Valley).
The word "corn", used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant "Zea mays", the most important crop in the U.S., originally named "Indian corn" by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as "grain".
Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by "barn" (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and "team" (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms "range, (corn) crib, truck, elevator, sharecropping" and "feedlot."
"Ranch," later applied to a house style, derives from Mexican Spanish; most Spanish contributions came after the War of 1812, with the opening of the West.
Among these are, other than toponyms, "chaps" (from "chaparreras), plaza, lasso, bronco, , rodeo;" examples of "English" additions from the cowboy era are "bad man, maverick, chuck" ("food") and "Boot Hill;" from the California Gold Rush came such idioms as "hit pay dirt" or "strike it rich."
The word "blizzard" probably originated in the West.
A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb "belittle" and the noun "bid," both first used in writing by  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> .
With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts "(land office, lot, outlands, waterfront," the verbs "locate" and "relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision)," types of property "(log cabin, adobe" in the 18th century; "frame house, apartment, tenement house, shack, " in the 19th century; "project, condominium, townhouse, split-level, mobile home, multi-family" in the 20th century), and parts thereof "(driveway, breezeway, backyard, dooryard; clapboard, siding, trim, baseboard; stoop" (from Dutch), "family room, den;" and, in recent years, "HVAC, central air, walkout basement)."
Ever since the American Revolution, a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are "run (i.e, for office), gubernatorial, primary election, carpetbagger" (after the Civil War), "repeater", "lame duck" (a British term used originally in Banking) and "pork barrel."
Some of these are internationally used (for example, "caucus, gerrymander, filibuster, exit poll)."
19th century onwards.
The development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms.
Typical examples are the vocabulary of "railroading" (see further at rail terminology) and "transportation" terminology, ranging from names of roads (from "dirt roads" and "back roads" to "freeways" and "parkways)" to road infrastructure "(parking lot, overpass, rest area)," and from automotive terminology to "public transit" (for example, in the sentence ""riding" the "subway downtown""); such American introductions as "commuter" (from "commutation ticket), concourse, to board" (a vehicle), "to park, double-park" and "parallel park" (a car), "" or the noun "terminal" have long been used in all dialects of English.
Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations "(bartender, longshoreman, patrolman, hobo, bouncer, bellhop, roustabout, white collar, blue collar, employee, boss" [from Dutch], "intern, busboy, mortician, senior citizen)," businesses and workplaces "(department store, supermarket, thrift store, gift shop, drugstore, motel, main street, gas station, hardware store, savings and loan, hock" [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations "(automated teller machine, smart card, cash register, dishwasher, reservation" [as at hotels], "pay envelope, movie, mileage, shortage, outage, blood bank)."
Already existing English words—such as "store, shop, dry goods, haberdashery, lumber"—underwent shifts in meaning; some—such as "mason, student, clerk", the verbs "can" (as in "canned goods"), "ship, fix, carry, enroll" (as in school), "run" (as in "run a business"), "release" and "haul"—were given new significations, while others (such as "tradesman)" have retained meanings that disappeared in England.
From the world of business and finance came "breakeven, merger, , downsize, disintermediation, bottom line;" from sports terminology came, jargon aside, "Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan" (football); "in the ballpark, out of left field, off base, hit and run," and many other idioms from baseball; gamblers coined "bluff, , ante, bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown;" miners coined "bedrock, bonanza, peter out, pan out" and the verb "prospect" from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with "make the grade, sidetrack, head-on," and the verb "railroad."
A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: "elevator, ground, gasoline;" many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not "(hatchback, sport utility vehicle, station wagon, tailgate, motorhome, truck, pickup truck, to exhaust)."
In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from Yiddish "(chutzpah, schmooze, tush") and German—"hamburger" and culinary terms like "frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, wiener, deli(catessen); scram, kindergarten, gesundheit;" musical terminology "(whole note, half note," etc.); and apparently "cookbook, fresh" ("impudent") and "what gives?"
Such constructions as "Are you coming with?" and "I like to dance" (for "I like dancing") may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.
Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from "OK" and "cool" to "nerd" and "24/7)," while others have not "(have a nice day, for sure);" many are now distinctly old-fashioned "(swell, groovy)."
Some English words now in general use, such as "hijacking, disc jockey, boost, bulldoze" and "jazz," originated as American slang.
Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are "get the hang of, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, stiff upper lip, bad hair day, throw a monkey wrench, under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over, what goes around comes around," and "will the real x please stand up?" Morphology.
American English has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs.
Examples of verbed nouns are "interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service" (as a car), "corner, torch, exit" (as in "exit the lobby"), "factor" (in mathematics), "gun" ("shoot"), "author" (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, "proposition, graft" (bribery), "bad-mouth, vacation, major, backpack, backtrack, intern, ticket" (traffic violations), "hassle, blacktop, peer-review, dope" and "OD", and, of course "verbed" as used at the start of this sentence.
Compounds coined in the U.S. are for instance "foothill, flatlands, badlands, landslide" (in all senses), "overview" (the noun), ", teenager, brainstorm, , hitchhike, smalltime, , frontman, lowbrow" and "highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face" (later verbed), "upfront" (in all senses), "fixer-upper, no-show;" many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: "non-profit, for-profit, free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;" many compound nouns and adjectives are open: "happy hour, fall guy, capital gain, road trip, wheat pit, head start, plea bargain;" some of these are colorful "(empty nester, loan shark, , buzz saw, ghetto blaster, dust bunny)," others are euphemistic "(differently abled (physically challenged), human resources, affirmative action, correctional facility)."
Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: ", stopover, lineup, , tryout, spin-off, rundown" ("summary"), "shootout, holdup, hideout, comeback, cookout, kickback, makeover, takeover, rollback" ("decrease"), "rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up" ("stoppage"), "stand-in."
These essentially are nouned phrasal verbs; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin "(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in" and "check out" (in all senses), "fill in" ("inform"), "kick in" or "throw in" ("contribute"), "square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off" (from employment), "run into" and "across" ("meet"), "stop by, pass up, put up" (money), "set up" ("frame"), "trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out)."
Noun endings such as "-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)" and "-cian (beautician)" are also particularly productive.
Some verbs ending in "-ize" are of U.S. origin; for example, "fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, weatherize, winterize, Mirandize;" and so are some back-formations "(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve" and "enthuse)."
Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are "as of" (with dates and times), "outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to" and "lack for."
Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably "pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry" (as in "pry open", from "prize), putter" (verb), "buddy, sundae, skeeter, sashay" and "kitty-corner."
Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, "lengthy, bossy, cute" and "cutesy, grounded" (of a child), "punk" (in all senses), "sticky" (of the weather), "through" (as in "through train", or meaning "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as "peppy" or "wacky".
American blends include "motel, guesstimate, infomercial" and "televangelist."
English words that survived in the United States and not in the United Kingdom.
A number of words and meanings that originated in Middle English or Early Modern English and that have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in Lowland Scots.
Terms such as "fall" ("autumn"), "faucet" ("tap"), "diaper" ("nappy"), "candy" ("sweets"), "skillet", "eyeglasses" and "obligate" are often regarded as Americanisms.
"Fall" for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year".
During the 17th century, English immigration to the British colonies in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them.
While the term "fall" gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America.
"Gotten" (past participle of "get") is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of Britain, such as Lancashire and North East England, that still continue to use it and sometimes also use "putten" as the past participle for "put" (which is not done by most speakers of American English).
Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include "hire" ("to employ"), "quit" ("to stop", which spawned "quitter" in the U.S.), "I guess" (famously criticized by  <START:person> H. W. Fowler <END> ), "baggage", "hit" (a place), and the adverbs "overly" and "presently" ("currently").
Some of these, for example "monkey wrench" and "wastebasket", originated in 19th century Britain.
The mandative subjunctive (as in "the City Attorney suggested that the case "not be closed"") is livelier in American English than it is in British English.
It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal.
The adjectives "mad" meaning "angry", "smart" meaning "intelligent", and "sick" meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English.
Regionally distinct English words within the United States.
Linguist  <START:person> Bert Vaux <END>  created a survey polling English speakers across the United States about the specific words they use for a variety of given definitions.
This 2003 study concludes that: Regional differences.
While written American English is (in general) standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary.
"General American" is the name given to any American accent that is often considered relatively free of noticeable regional influences.
Eastern seaboard.
After the Civil War, the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, (koineization) so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the Eastern seaboard.
The Connecticut River and Long Island Sound is usually regarded as the southern/western extent of New England speech, which has its roots in the speech of the Puritans from East Anglia who settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
The Potomac River generally divides a group of Northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the Coastal Southern dialect area; in between these two rivers several local variations exist, chief among them the one that prevails in and around New York City and northern New Jersey, which developed on a Dutch substratum after the English conquered New Amsterdam.
The main features of Coastal Southern speech can be traced to the speech of the English from the West Country who settled in Virginia after leaving England at the time of the English Civil War.
Midwest.
A distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between Canada and the United States, centered on the Great Lakes region (but only on the American side).
This is the Inland North Dialect—the "standard Midwestern" speech that was the basis for General American in the mid-20th century (although it has been recently modified by the northern cities vowel shift).
Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both collectively as "Midwestern" in the Mid-Atlantic region or "Northern" in the Southern US.
The so-called '"Minnesotan" dialect is also prevalent in the cultural Upper Midwest, and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (like "yah" for yes, pronounced similarly to "ja" in German, Norwegian and Swedish).
In parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio, another dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch English is also spoken.
Interior.
In the interior, the situation is very different.
West of the Appalachian Mountains begins the broad zone of what is generally called "Midland" speech.
This is divided into two discrete subdivisions, the North Midland that begins north of the Ohio River valley area, and the South Midland speech; sometimes the former is designated simply "Midland" and the latter is reckoned as "Highland Southern".
The North Midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related Western dialect which contains Pacific Northwest English as well as California English, although in the immediate San Francisco area some older speakers do not possess the cot–caught merger and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which reflects a historical Mid-Atlantic heritage.
The South Midland or Highland Southern dialect follows the Ohio River in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across Arkansas and Oklahoma west of the Mississippi, and peters out in West Texas.
It is a version of the Midland speech that has assimilated some coastal Southern forms (outsiders often mistakenly believe South Midland speech and coastal South speech to be the same).
Although no longer region-specific, African American Vernacular English, which remains prevalent among African Americans, has a close relationship to Southern varieties of American English and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans.
The island state of Hawaii has a distinctive Hawaiian Pidgin.
Finally, dialect development in the United States has been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Charleston, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which imposed their marks on the surrounding areas.
Differences between British and American English.
American English and British English (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, "An American Dictionary of the English Language", was written by  <START:person> Noah Webster <END>  in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.
Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and normally do not affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some verbal auxiliaries; formal (rather than notional) agreement with collective nouns; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: "learned"/"learnt", "burned"/"burnt", "snuck/sneaked", "dove/dived") although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE "in school," BrE "at school"); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE "to the hospital", BrE "to hospital"; contrast, however, AmE "actress  <START:person> Elizabeth Taylor <END> ", BrE "the actress  <START:person> Elizabeth Taylor <END> ").
Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other, and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.
Differences in orthography are also minor.
The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as "flavor" for British "flavour", "fiber" for "fibre", "defense" for "defence", "analyze" for "analyse", "catalog" for "catalogue" and "traveling" for "travelling".
 <START:person> Noah Webster <END>  popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them.
Rather, "he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology".
Other differences are due to the francophile tastes of 19th century Victorian England (for example they preferred "programme" for "program", "manoeuvre" for "maneuver", "cheque" for "check", etc.).
AmE almost always uses "-ize" in words like "realize".
BrE prefers "-ise", but also uses "-ize" (see Oxford spelling).
There are a few differences in punctuation rules.
British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called "comma splices" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside.
American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.
AmE sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE "transportation" and BrE "transport" or where the British form is a back-formation, such as AmE "burglarize" and BrE "burgle" (from "burglar").
However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.
Apollo 14  Apollo 14 was the eighth manned mission in the United States Apollo program, and the third to land on the Moon.
It was the last of the "H missions," targeted landings with two-day stays on the Moon with two lunar EVAs, or moonwalks.
Commander  <START:person> Alan Shepard <END> , Command Module Pilot  <START:person> Stuart Roosa <END> , and Lunar Module Pilot  <START:person> Edgar Mitchell <END>  launched on their nine-day mission on January 31, 1971 at 4:04:02 pm local time after a 40-minute, 2 second delay due to launch site weather restrictions, the first such delay in the Apollo program.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  made their lunar landing on February 5 in the Fra Mauro formation; this had originally been the target of the aborted Apollo 13 mission.
During the two lunar EVAs, 42 kg of Moon rocks were collected and several surface experiments, including seismic studies, were performed.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  famously hit two golf balls on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought from Earth.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  spent about 33 hours on the Moon, with about 9½ hours on EVA.
In the aftermath of Apollo 13, several modifications were made to the service module to prevent a repeat of that accident, including improved wiring insulation and a third oxygen tank.
While  <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  were on the surface,  <START:person> Roosa <END>  remained in lunar orbit aboard the Command/Service Module "Kitty Hawk", performing scientific experiments and photographing the Moon, including the landing site of the future Apollo 16 mission.
He took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were germinated on return, resulting in the so-called Moon trees.
 <START:person> Shepard <END> ,  <START:person> Roosa <END> , and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  landed in the Pacific Ocean on February 9. Crew.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  was the oldest U.S. astronaut when he made his trip aboard Apollo 14.
He is the only astronaut from Project Mercury (the original Mercury Seven astronauts) to reach the Moon.
Another of the original seven,  <START:person> Gordon Cooper <END> , had (as Apollo 10's backup commander) tentatively been scheduled to command the mission, but according to author  <START:person> Andrew Chaikin <END> , his casual attitude toward training, along with problems with NASA hierarchy (reaching all the way back to the Mercury-Atlas 9 flight), resulted in his removal.
The mission was a personal triumph for  <START:person> Shepard <END> , who had battled back from  <START:person> Ménière <END> 's disease which grounded him from 1964 to 1968.
He and his crew were originally scheduled to fly on Apollo 13, but in 1969 NASA officials switched the scheduled crews for Apollos 13 and 14.
This was done to allow  <START:person> Shepard <END>  more time to train for his flight, as he had been grounded for four years.
As of 2015,  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  is the only surviving member of the crew;  <START:person> Roosa <END>  died in 1994 from pancreatitis and  <START:person> Shepard <END>  in 1998 from leukemia.
Mission highlights.
Launch and flight to lunar orbit.
Apollo 14 launched during heavy cloud cover and the Saturn V booster quickly disappeared from view.
However, NASA's long-range cameras, based 60 miles south in Vero Beach, had a clear shot of the remainder of the launch.
Following the launch, the Launch Control Center at Kennedy Space Center was visited by U.S. Vice President  <START:person> Spiro T. Agnew <END> , Prince  <START:person> Juan Carlos <END>  of Spain, and his wife, Princess  <START:person> Sofía <END> .
At the beginning of the mission, the CSM "Kitty Hawk" had difficulty achieving capture and docking with the LM "Antares".
Repeated attempts to dock went on for 1 hour and 42 minutes, until it was suggested that  <START:person> Roosa <END>  hold "Kitty Hawk" against "Antares" using its thrusters, then the docking probe would be retracted out of the way, hopefully triggering the docking latches.
This attempt was successful, and no further docking problems were encountered during the mission.
Lunar descent.
After separating from the Command Module in lunar orbit, the LM "Antares" also had two serious problems.
First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from a faulty switch.
NASA believed that the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of solder had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit.
The immediate solution—tapping on the panel next to the switch—did work briefly, but the circuit soon closed again.
If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the ascent stage to separate from the descent stage and climb back into orbit.
NASA and the software teams at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scrambled to find a solution, and determined the fix would involve reprogramming the flight software to ignore the false signal.
The software modifications were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time.
A second problem occurred during the powered descent, when the LM landing radar failed to lock automatically onto the  <START:person> Moon <END> 's surface, depriving the navigation computer of vital information on the vehicle's altitude and vertical descent speed (this was not a result of the modifications to the ABORT command; rather, the post-mission report indicated it was an unrelated bug in the radar's operation).
After the astronauts cycled the landing radar breaker, the unit successfully acquired a signal near 18000 ft, again just in the nick of time.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  then manually landed the LM closer to its intended target than any of the other six Moon landing missions.
 <START:person> Mitchell <END>  believes that  <START:person> Shepard <END>  would have continued with the landing attempt without the radar, using the LM inertial guidance system and visual cues.
But a post-flight review of the descent data showed the inertial system alone would have been inadequate, and the astronauts probably would have been forced to abort the landing as they approached the surface.
Lunar surface operations.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  named their landing site "Fra Mauro Base", and this designation is recognized by the International Astronomical Union (depicted in Latin on lunar maps as "Statio Fra Mauro").
 <START:person> Shepard <END> 's first words, after stepping onto the lunar surface were, "And it's been a long way, but we're here."
Unlike  <START:person> Neil Armstrong <END>  on Apollo 11 and  <START:person> Pete Conrad <END>  on Apollo 12,  <START:person> Shepard <END>  had already stepped off the LM footpad and was a few yards (meters) away before he spoke.
 <START:person> Shepard <END> 's moonwalking suit was the first to utilize red stripes on the arms and legs and on the top of the lunar EVA sunshade "hood," so as to allow easy identification between the commander and LM pilot on the surface; on the Apollo 12 pictures, it had been almost impossible to distinguish between the two crewmen, causing a great deal of confusion.
This feature was included on  <START:person> Jim Lovell <END> 's Apollo 13 suit; however, because no landing was made on that mission, Apollo 14 was the first to make use of it.
This feature was used for the remaining Apollo missions, and for the EVAs of Space Shuttle flights afterwards, and it is still in use today on both the U.S. and Russian space suits on the International Space Station.
After landing in the Fra Mauro formation—the destination for Apollo 13— <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  took two moonwalks, adding new seismic studies to the by now familiar Apollo experiment package (ALSEP), and using the Modular Equipment Transporter (MET), a pull cart for carrying equipment and samples, referred to as a "lunar rickshaw."
 <START:person> Roosa <END> , meanwhile, took pictures from on board Command Module "Kitty Hawk" in lunar orbit.
The second moonwalk, or EVA, was intended to reach the rim of the 1000 ft wide Cone Crater.
However, the two astronauts were not able to find the rim amid the rolling terrain of the crater's slopes.
They became physically exhausted from the attempt and with their suits' oxygen supplies starting to run low, the effort was called off.
Later analysis, using the pictures that they took, determined that they had come within an estimated 65 ft of the crater's rim.
Images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) show the tracks of the astronauts and the MET come to within 30 m of the rim.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  deployed and activated various scientific instruments and experiments and collected almost 100 lb of lunar samples for return to Earth.
Other Apollo 14 achievements included: the only use of MET; longest distance traversed by foot on the lunar surface; first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; and the first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.
The astronauts also engaged in less serious activities on the Moon.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  brought along a six iron golf club head which he could attach to the handle of a lunar excavation tool, and two golf balls, and took several one-handed swings (due to the limited flexibility of the EVA suit).
He exuberantly exclaimed that the second ball went "miles and miles and miles" in the low lunar gravity, but later estimated the distance as 200 to.
 <START:person> Mitchell <END>  then threw a lunar scoop handle as if it were a javelin.
Return, splashdown and quarantine.
On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space.
The Command Module "Kitty Hawk" splashed down in the South Pacific Ocean on February 9, 1971 at 21:05 [UTC], approximately 760 nmi south of American Samoa.
After recovery by the ship USS "New Orleans", the crew was flown to Pago Pago International Airport in Tafuna for a reception before being flown on a C-141 cargo plane to Honolulu.
The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be quarantined on their return from the Moon.
 <START:person> Roosa <END> , who worked in forestry in his youth, took several hundred tree seeds on the flight.
These were germinated after the return to Earth, and widely distributed around the world as commemorative Moon trees.
Mission insignia.
The oval insignia shows a gold NASA Astronaut Pin, given to U.S. astronauts upon completing their first space flight, traveling from the Earth to the Moon.
A gold band around the edge includes the mission and astronaut names.
The designer was  <START:person> Jean Beaulieu <END> .
The backup crew spoofed the patch with its own version, with revised artwork showing a  <START:person> Wile E. Coyote <END>  cartoon character depicted as gray-bearded (for  <START:person> Shepard <END> , who was 47 at the time of the mission and the oldest man on the Moon), pot-bellied (for  <START:person> Mitchell <END> , who had a pudgy appearance) and red furred (for  <START:person> Roosa <END> 's red hair), still on the way to the Moon, while Road Runner (for the backup crew) is already on the Moon, holding a U.S. flag and a flag labeled "1st Team."
The flight name is replaced by "BEEP BEEP" and the backup crew's names are given.
Several of these patches were hidden by the backup crew and found during the flight by the crew in notebooks and storage lockers in both the CSM "Kitty Hawk" and the LM "Antares" spacecraft, and one patch was even stored on the MET lunar hand cart.
Spacecraft location.
The Apollo 14 Command Module "Kitty Hawk" is on display at the Apollo/Saturn V Center building at the Kennedy Space Center after being on display at the Astronaut Hall of Fame near Titusville, Florida, for several years.
The ascent stage of Lunar Module "Antares" impacted the Moon on February 7, 1971 at 00:45:25.7 UT (February 6, 7:45 PM EST) .
"Antares"' descent stage and the mission's other equipment remain at Fra Mauro at .
Photographs taken in 2009 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter were released on July 17, and the Fra Mauro equipment was the most visible Apollo hardware at that time, owing to particularly good lighting conditions.
In 2011, the LRO returned to the landing site at a lower altitude to take higher resolution photographs.

NASA reports Multimedia  A. J. Ayer  Sir  <START:person> Alfred Jules <END>  "Freddie" Ayer (; 29 October 1910 – 27 June 1989) was a British philosopher known for his promotion of logical positivism, particularly in his books "Language, Truth, and Logic" (1936) and "The Problem of Knowledge" (1956).
He was educated at Eton College and Oxford University, after which he studied the philosophy of Logical Positivism at the University of Vienna.
From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at Christ Church College, Oxford.
During the Second World War Ayer was a Special Operations Executive and MI6 agent.
He was Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become Wykeham Professor of Logic.
He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1951 to 1952 and knighted in 1970.
Early life.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was born in St John's Wood, in north west London, to a wealthy family from continental Europe.
His mother,  <START:person> Reine Citroën <END> , was from the Dutch Jewish family who founded the Citroën car company in France.
His father,  <START:person> Jules Ayer <END> , was a Swiss Calvinist financier who worked for the  <START:person> Rothschild <END>  family.
Education.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was educated at Ascham St Vincent's School, a former boarding preparatory school for boys in the seaside town of Eastbourne in Sussex, in which he started boarding at the comparatively early age of seven, due to the First World War, and Eton College, a boarding school in Eton (near Windsor) in Berkshire.
It was at Eton that  <START:person> Ayer <END>  first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity.
Although primarily interested in furthering his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the Eton Wall Game very well.
In the final examinations at Eton,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  came second in his year, and first in classics.
In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of corporal punishment at the school.
He won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.
Life and career.
After graduation from Oxford University Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, "Language, Truth and Logic" in 1936.
The first exposition in English of Logical Positivism as newly developed by the Vienna Circle, this made Ayer at age 26 the 'enfant terrible' of British philosophy.
In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and MI6).
After the war he briefly returned to Oxford University where he became a fellow and Dean of Wadham College.
He thereafter taught philosophy at London University from 1946 until 1959, when he also started to appear on radio and television.
He was an extrovert, and social mixer, and was married four times, including to  <START:person> Dee Wells <END>  and  <START:person> Vanessa Salmon <END>  (thus becoming stepfather to  <START:person> Nigella Lawson <END> ).
Reputedly he liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York.
He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of the Tottenham Hotspur football team.
For an academic,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high society' and the establishment.
Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.
Philosophical ideas.
In Language, Truth and Logic (1936),  <START:person> Ayer <END>  asserts the verification principle as the only valid basis for philosophy.
Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like "God exists" or "charity is good" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored.
Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense.
He also criticises  <START:person> C. A. Mace <END> 's opinion that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry.
The stance of a person who believes "God" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as igtheism (for example, by  <START:person> Paul Kurtz <END> ).
In later years  <START:person> Ayer <END>  reiterated that he did not believe in God and began to refer to himself as an atheist.
He followed in the footsteps of  <START:person> Bertrand Russell <END>  by debating with the Jesuit scholar  <START:person> Frederick Copleston <END>  on the topic of religion.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's version of emotivism divides "the ordinary system of ethics" into four classes: He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in normative ethics as opposed to meta-ethics) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.
While class three statements were irrelevant to Ayer's brand of emotivism, they would later play a significant role in  <START:person> Stevenson <END> 's.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with ethical intuitionists.
But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition as "worthless" for determining moral truths, since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another.
Instead,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  concludes that ethical concepts are "mere pseudo-concepts": The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content.
Thus if I say to someone, "You acted wrongly in stealing that money," I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, "You stole that money."
In adding that this action is wrong I am not making any further statement about it.
I am simply evincing my moral disapproval of it.
It is as if I had said, "You stole that money," in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the addition of some special exclamation marks.
… If now I generalise my previous statement and say, "Stealing money is wrong," I produce a sentence that has no factual meaning—that is, expresses no proposition that can be either true or false.
… I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments.
Between 1945 and 1947, together with  <START:person> Russell <END>  and  <START:person> George Orwell <END> , he contributed a series of articles to "Polemic", a short-lived British "Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics" edited by the ex-Communist  <START:person> Humphrey Slater <END> .
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was closely associated with the British humanist movement.
He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1947 until his death.
He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.
In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded  <START:person> Julian Huxley <END>  as president of the British Humanist Association, a post he held until 1970.
In 1968 he edited "The Humanist Outlook", a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism.
In addition he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.
He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at Bard College in the fall of 1987.
At a party that same year held by fashion designer  <START:person> Fernando Sanchez <END> ,  <START:person> Ayer <END> , then 77, confronted  <START:person> Mike Tyson <END>  who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model  <START:person> Naomi Campbell <END> .
When  <START:person> Ayer <END>  demanded that  <START:person> Tyson <END>  stop, the boxer said: "Do you know who the fuck I am?
I'm the heavyweight champion of the world," to which  <START:person> Ayer <END>  replied: "And I am the former Wykeham Professor of Logic.
We are both pre-eminent in our field.
I suggest that we talk about this like rational men".
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  and  <START:person> Tyson <END>  then began to talk, while  <START:person> Naomi Campbell <END>  slipped out.
Later career.
From 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir  <START:person> Alfred <END>  held the Wykham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford.
He was knighted in 1970.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  died on 27 June 1989.
From 1980 – 1989,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  lived at 51 York Street, Marylebone, where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.
Personal life.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was married four times to three women.
His first marriage was from 1932–1941 to (Grace Isabel)  <START:person> Renée <END>  (d.
1980), who subsequently married philosopher  <START:person> Stuart Hampshire <END> ,  <START:person> Ayer <END> 's friend and colleague.
In 1960 he married  <START:person> Alberta Constance <END>  (Dee) Wells (1925–2003), with whom he had one son.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's marriage to  <START:person> Wells <END>  was dissolved in 1983 and that same year he married  <START:person> Vanessa Salmon <END> , former wife of politician  <START:person> Nigel Lawson <END> .
She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried  <START:person> Dee Wells <END> , who survived him.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist  <START:person> Sheilah Graham Westbrook <END> .
Near-death experience.
In 1988, shortly before his death,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  wrote an article entitled, "What I saw when I was dead", describing an unusual near-death experience.
Of the experience,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  first said that it "slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be."
However, a few days later he revised this, saying "what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief".
In 2001 Dr  <START:person> Jeremy George <END> , the attending physician, claimed that  <START:person> Ayer <END>  had confided to him: "I saw a Divine Being.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions."
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's son  <START:person> Nick <END> , however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.
Works.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  is best known for popularising the verification principle, in particular through his presentation of it in "Language, Truth, and Logic" (1936).
The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called Vienna Circle which  <START:person> Ayer <END>  visited as a young guest.
Others, including the leading light of the circle,  <START:person> Moritz Schlick <END> , were already offering their own papers on the issue.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable empirical import, otherwise it is either "analytical" if tautologous, or "metaphysical" (i.e.
meaningless, or "literally senseless").
He started to work on the book at the age of 23 and it was published when he was 26.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and  <START:person> David Hume <END> .
His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes "Language, Truth and Logic" essential reading on the tenets of logical empiricism– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century analytic philosophy, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world.
In it,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour', an argument which anticipates the Turing test published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  wrote two books on the philosopher  <START:person> Bertrand Russell <END> , " <START:person> Russell <END>  and  <START:person> Moore <END> : The Analytic Heritage" (1971) and "Russell" (1972).
He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of  <START:person> David Hume <END>  and a short biography of  <START:person> Voltaire <END> .
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was strong critic of the German philosopher  <START:person> Martin Heidegger <END> .
As a logical positivist  <START:person> Ayer <END>  was in conflict with  <START:person> Heidegger <END> 's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence.
These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis.
This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought.
He considered  <START:person> Heidegger <END>  to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.
In 1972–1973  <START:person> Ayer <END>  gave the Gifford Lectures at University of St Andrews, later published as "The Central Questions of Philosophy".
In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord  <START:person> Gifford <END>  wished to promote '"Natural Theology", in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are "able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth".
He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called "philosophy"– including the whole of metaphysics, theology and aesthetics– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.
In "The Concept of a Person and Other Essays" (1963),  <START:person> Ayer <END>  heavily criticized  <START:person> Wittgenstein <END> 's private language argument.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's sense-data theory in "Foundations of Empirical Knowledge" was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian  <START:person> J. L. Austin <END>  in "Sense and Sensibilia", a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  responded to this in the essay "Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?", which can be found in his "Metaphysics and Common Sense" (1969).
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci  Amerigo Vespucci <END>  (]; March 9, 1454 – February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus' voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to Afro-Eurasians.
Colloquially referred to as the New World, this second super continent came to be termed "America", deriving its name from Americus, the Latin version of  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's first name.
Background.
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  was born and raised in Florence, Italy.
He was the third son of  <START:person> Ser Nastagio <END>  ( <START:person> Anastasio <END> ), a Florentine notary, and Lisabetta Mini.
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  was educated by his uncle,  <START:person> Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci <END> , a Dominican friar of the monastery of San Marco in Florence.
While his elder brothers were sent to the University of Pisa to pursue scholarly careers,  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial house of Medici, headed by  <START:person> Lorenzo <END>  de' Medici.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  acquired the favor and protection of  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici <END>  who became the head of the business after the elder  <START:person> Lorenzo <END> 's death in 1492.
In March 1492, the  <START:person> Medici <END>  dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  and  <START:person> Donato Niccolini <END>  as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in Cádiz (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.
In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop  <START:person> Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca <END> , the Crown of Castile broke their monopoly deal with  <START:person> Christopher Columbus <END>  and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the West Indies.
Just around this time (1495–96),  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was engaged as the executor of  <START:person> Giannotto Berardi <END> , an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  organized the fulfillment of  <START:person> Berardi <END> 's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.
After these were delivered,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.
Expeditions.
At the invitation of king  <START:person> Manuel <END>  I of Portugal,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of South America between 1499 and 1502.
On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.
The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  were published between 1502 and 1504.
In 1507,  <START:person> Martin Waldseemüller <END>  produced a world map on which he named the new continent America after the feminine Latin version of  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's first name, which is Americus.
In an accompanying book,  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was trying to upset  <START:person> Christopher Columbus <END> ' glory.
However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the Soderini Letter, could be fabrications, not by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , but by others.
Historical role.
In 1508 the position of chief of navigation of Spain ("piloto mayor de Indias") was created for  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.
Two letters attributed to  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  were published during his lifetime.
"Mundus Novus" (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from Lisbon to  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco <END>  de' Medici.
It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502.
"Mundus Novus" was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.
"Lettera di  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi" (Letter of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as "Lettera al Soderini" or just "Lettera", was a letter in Italian addressed to  <START:person> Piero Soderini <END> .
Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  between 1497 and 1504.
A Latin translation was published by the German  <START:person> Martin Waldseemüller <END>  in 1507 in "Cosmographiae Introductio", a book on cosmography and geography, as "Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes" (Four Voyages of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END> ).
On March 22, 1508, King  <START:person> Ferdinand <END>  made  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).
In the 18th century three unpublished familiar letters from  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered.
One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the "four voyages".
Another was written from Cape Verde in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic.
The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.
Some have suggested that  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications.
However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> .
It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  to name the new continent America on his world map of 1507 in  <START:person> Lorraine <END> .
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  used a Latinised form of his name,  <START:person> Americus Vespucius <END> , in his Latin writings, which  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form "America", according to the prevalent view (for other hypotheses, see the footnote in the introduction).
The book accompanying the map stated: "I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women".
It is possible that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was not aware that  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  had named the continent after him.
The two disputed letters claim that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources.
At the moment there is a dispute between historians on when  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  visited the mainland the first time.
Some historians like  <START:person> Germán Arciniegas <END>  and  <START:person> Gabriel Camargo Pérez <END>  think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries.
From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication.
Voyages.
The first and fourth voyages are disputed to have occurred, while the second and third are certain voyages.
First voyage.
A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , written to  <START:person> Soderini <END> , of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498.
However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.
Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of hammocks and sweat lodges.
The names of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END> 's ships were the San Antiago, Repertaga, Wegiz, and the Girmand.
Second voyage.
About 1499–1500,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with  <START:person> Alonso de Ojeda <END>  (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander.
The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the Indian Ocean.
After hitting land at the coast of what is now Guyana, the two seem to have separated.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the Amazon River and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing Trinidad and the Orinoco River and returning to Spain by way of  <START:person> Hispaniola <END> .
The letter, to  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici <END> , claims that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  determined his longitude celestially on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage.
However, that claim may be fraudulent, which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.
Third voyage.
The last certain voyage of  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was led by  <START:person> Gonçalo Coelho <END>  in 1501–1502 in the service of Portugal.
Departing from Lisbon, the fleet sailed first to Cape Verde where they met two of  <START:person> Pedro Álvares Cabral <END> 's ships returning from India.
In a letter from Cape Verde,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  says that he hopes to visit the same lands that  <START:person> Álvares Cabral <END>  had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage.
On reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed south along the coast of South America to Rio de Janeiro's bay.
If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of Patagonia before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the Río de la Plata, which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south.
Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of  <START:person> Coelho <END>  and  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , do not show any land south of present-day Cananéia at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.
After the first half of the expedition,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  mapped Alpha and Beta Centauri, as well as the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross.
Although these stars had been known to the ancient Greeks, gradual precession had lowered them below the European horizon so that they had been forgotten.
On his return to Lisbon,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  or  <START:person> Marco Polo <END>  and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.
Fourth voyage.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504.
Like his alleged first voyage,  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place.
The only source of information for the last voyage is the "Letter to Soderini", but as several modern scholars dispute  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  undertook this trip.[b]
However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain  <START:person> Gonçalo Coelho <END> , very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition ( <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  went on board this one as well.
However, it is not independently confirmed  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.
The letters caused controversy after  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed  <START:person> Columbus <END> ' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's reputation.
Personal.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was a cousin of the husband of  <START:person> Simonetta Vespucci <END> .
He married  <START:person> Maria Cerezo <END> .
One of the very few references to  <START:person> Amerigo <END> 's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512 giving his widow,  <START:person> Maria Cerezo <END>  a lifetime pension of ten thousand marvedis per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.
Final years.
Not long after his return to Spain,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  became a Spanish citizen.
On March 22, 1508 he was made the pilot major of Spain by  <START:person> Ferdinand II <END>  of Aragon in honor of his discoveries.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  also ran a school for navigators.
He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in Seville, Spain and was buried at  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  family burial place in Florence, Italy.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt  Johann Adam Weishaupt <END>  (6 February 1748 – 18 November 1830) was a German philosopher and founder of the Order of the Illuminati, a secret society.
Early life.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  was born on 6 February 1748 in Ingolstadt in the Electorate of Bavaria.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's father  <START:person> Johann Georg Weishaupt <END>  (1717–1753) died when  <START:person> Adam <END>  was five years old.
After his father's death he came under the tutelage of his godfather  <START:person> Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt <END>  who, like his father, was a professor of law at the University of Ingolstadt.
 <START:person> Ickstatt <END>  was a proponent of the philosophy of Christian  <START:person> Wolff <END>  and of the Enlightenment, and he influenced the young  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  with his rationalism.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  began his formal education at age seven at a Jesuit school.
He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768 at age 20 with a doctorate of law.
In 1772 he became a professor of law.
The following year he married  <START:person> Afra Sausenhofer <END>  of  <START:person> Eichstätt <END> .
After  <START:person> Pope Clement XIV <END> ’s suppression of the Society of  <START:person> Jesus <END>  in 1773,  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  became a professor of canon law, a position that was held exclusively by the Jesuits until that time.
In 1775  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was introduced to the empirical philosophy of  <START:person> Johann Georg Heinrich Feder <END>  of the University of Göttingen.
Both  <START:person> Feder <END>  and  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  would later become opponents of Kantian idealism.
Founder of the Illuminati.
At a time, however, when there was no end of making game of and abusing secret societies, I planned to make use of this human foible for a real and worthy goal, for the benefit of people.
I wished to do what the heads of the ecclesiastical and secular authorities ought to have done by virtue of their offices ... On May day 1776  <START:person> Johann Adam Weishaupt <END>  founded the "Illuminati" in the Electorate of Bavaria.
He adopted the name of "Brother Spartacus" within the order.
Even Encyclopedia references vary on the goal of the order, such as New Advent saying the Order was not egalitarian or democratic internally, and sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society; while others like  <START:person> Collier <END> 's have said the aim was to combat religion and foster rationalism in its place.
The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies.
Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know: a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was initiated into the Masonic Lodge "Theodor zum guten Rath", at Munich in 1777.
His project of "illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice" was an unwelcome reform.
He used Freemasonry to recruit for his own quasi-masonic society, with the goal of "perfecting human nature" through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion.
Presenting their own system as pure masonry,  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  and  <START:person> Adolph Freiherr Knigge <END> , who organised his ritual structure, greatly expanded the secret organisation.
Contrary to  <START:person> Immanuel Kant <END> 's famous dictum that Enlightenment (and  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order was in some respects an expression of the Enlightenment Movement) was the passage by man out of his 'self-imposed immaturity' through daring to 'make use of his own reason, without the guidance of another,'  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order of Illuminati prescribed in great detail everything which the members had obediently to read and think, so that Dr.  <START:person> Wolfgang Riedel <END>  has commented that this approach to illumination or enlightenment constituted a degradation and twisting of the Kantian principle of Enlightenment.
 <START:person> Riedel <END>  writes: 'The independence of thought and judgement required by Kant ... was specifically prevented by the Order of the Illuminati's rules and regulations.
Enlightenment takes place here, if it takes place at all, precisely "under" the direction of another, namely under that of the "Superiors" [of the Order].
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's radical rationalism and vocabulary was not likely to succeed.
Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of  <START:person> Karl Theodor <END> , Elector of Bavaria, in 1784.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria.
Activities in exile.
He received the assistance of  <START:person> Duke Ernest II <END>  of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1745–1804), and lived in Gotha writing a series of works on illuminism, including "A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria" (1785), "A Picture of Illuminism" (1786), "An Apology for the Illuminati" (1786), and "An Improved System of Illuminism" (1787).
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  died in Gotha on 18 November 1830.
He was survived by his second wife,  <START:person> Anna Maria <END>  (née Sausenhofer), and his children  <START:person> Nanette <END> , Charlotte, Ernst,  <START:person> Karl <END> ,  <START:person> Eduard <END> , and  <START:person> Alfred <END> .
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was buried next to his son  <START:person> Wilhelm <END>  who preceded him in death in 1802.
After  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order of Illuminati was banned and its members dispersed, it left behind no enduring traces of an influence, not even on its own erstwhile members, who went on in the future to develop in quite different directions.
Assessment of character and intentions.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's character and intentions have been variously assessed: from those such as the Abbé Barruel and  <START:person> John Robison <END>  who regarded him as a 'human devil' and saw his mission as one of malevolent destructiveness, to those who view him as a humane and benign, albeit wilful, social reformer.
Writing on this topic, Dr.  <START:person> Tony Page <END>  comments: "Weishaupt’s plan was to educate Illuminati followers in the highest levels of humanity and morality (basing his teachings on the supremacy of Reason, allied with the spirit of the Golden Rule of not doing to others what one would not wish done to oneself), so that if  <START:person> Illuminati <END>  alumni subsequently attained positions of significance and power (such as in the fields of education and politics), they could exert a benevolent and uplifting influence upon society at large.
His project was utopian and naively optimistic, and he himself was certainly not without flaws of character – but neither he nor his plan was evil or violent in and of themselves.
It is one of the deplorable and tragic ironies of history that a man who tried to inculcate virtue, philanthropy, social justice and morality has become one of the great hate-figures of 21st-century ‘conspiracy’ thinking."
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  in pop culture.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is referred to repeatedly in "The Illuminatus!
Trilogy", written by  <START:person> Robert Shea <END>  and  <START:person> Robert Anton Wilson <END> , as the founder of the Illuminati and as an imposter who killed  <START:person> George Washington <END>  and took his place as the first president of the United States.
Washington's portrait on the U.S. one-dollar bill is said to actually be  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's.
Another version of  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  appears in the extensive comic book novel "Cerebus the Aardvark" by  <START:person> Dave Sim <END> , as a combination of  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  and  <START:person> George Washington <END> .
He appears primarily in the "Cerebus" and "Church & State I" volumes.
His motives are republican confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's name is one of many references made to the Illuminati and other conspiracies in the video game "Deus Ex" (2000).
The protagonist uncovers a virus engineered by the VersaLife Corporation with its molecular structure in multiples of 17 and 23.
An ally of the protagonist notes "1723.
The birth of  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END> " even though this reference is actually incorrect as  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was born in 1748.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is also mentioned (" <START:person> Bush <END>  got a ouija to talk to  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END> ") by the New York rapper  <START:person> Cage <END>  in El-P's "Accidents Don't Happen", the ninth track on his album "Fantastic Damage" (2002).
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is briefly mentioned in  <START:person> Umberto Eco <END> 's novel "The Prague Cemetery".
 <START:person> Asterix  Asterix <END>  or The Adventures of  <START:person> Asterix <END>  (French: Astérix or Astérix le Gaulois, ]) is a series of French comics.
The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine "Pilote" on 29 October 1959.
It was written by  <START:person> René Goscinny <END>  and illustrated by  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  until the death of  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  in 1977.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette.
As of 2013, 35 volumes have been released.
The series follows the exploits of a village of indomitable Gauls as they resist Roman occupation.
They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid called Getafix in the English translations, which gives the recipient superhuman strength.
The protagonist, the titular character  <START:person> Asterix <END> , along with his friend  <START:person> Obelix <END>  have various adventures.
The "ix" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish "ix" names in the series) "alludes" to the "rix" suffix (meaning "king") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as Vercingetorix, Orgetorix, and Dumnorix.
(See below for further explanations of the character names.)
Many of the stories have them travel to foreign countries, though others are set in and around their village.
For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.
The  <START:person> Asterix <END>  series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most European countries.
The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into 12 films: eight animated, and four live action.
There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris,  <START:person> Parc Astérix <END> .
To date, 325 million copies of 34 Asterix books have been sold worldwide, making co-creators  <START:person> René Goscinny <END>  and  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  France's bestselling authors abroad.
History.
Prior to creating the  <START:person> Asterix <END>  series,  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  and  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  had previously had success with their series "Oumpah-pah", which was published in "Tintin" magazine.
"Astérix" was originally serialised in "Pilote" magazine, in the very first issue published on 29 October 1959.
In 1961 the first book was put together, titled "Asterix the Gaul".
From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis.
Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000.
In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000.
A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and the Big Fight" sold 400,000 upon initial publication.
The ninth Asterix volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END> 's first sketches portrayed  <START:person> Asterix <END>  as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior.
But  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  had a different picture in his mind.
He visualized  <START:person> Asterix <END>  as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength.
However,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  agreed.
Hence,  <START:person> Obelix <END>  was born.
Despite the growing popularity of  <START:person> Asterix <END>  with the readers, the financial backing for Pilote ceased.
 <START:person> Pilote <END>  was taken over by  <START:person> Georges Dargaud <END> .
When  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  died in 1977,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue.
He continued the series but on a less frequent basis.
Most critics and fans of the series prefer  <START:person> Goscinny <END> 's albums.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  created his own publishing company, Les Editions Albert-René, which published every album drawn and written by  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  alone since then.
However,  <START:person> Dargaud <END> , the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  and  <START:person> Goscinny <END> .
In 1990, the  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  and  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  families decided to sue  <START:person> Dargaud <END>  to take over the rights.
In 1998, after a long trial,  <START:person> Dargaud <END>  lost the rights to publish and sell the albums.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  (40%),  <START:person> Sylvie Uderzo <END>  (20%) and  <START:person> Anne Goscinny <END>  (40%).
Although  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  declared he did not want anyone to continue the series after his death, which is similar to the request  <START:person> Hergé <END>  made regarding his "The Adventures of Tintin", his attitude changed and in December 2008 he sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company and now owns the rights.
In a letter published in the French newspaper "Le Monde" in 2009,  <START:person> Uderzo <END> 's daughter,  <START:person> Sylvie <END> , attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new "Astérix" adventures after his death.
She said "...the co-creator of "Astérix", France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance”.
However,  <START:person> René Goscinny <END> 's daughter  <START:person> Anne <END>  also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time.
She is reported to have said that " <START:person> Asterix <END>  has already had two lives: one during my father's lifetime and one after it.
Why not a third?".
A few months later,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  appointed three illustrators, who had been his assistants for many years, to continue the series.
In 2011,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  announced that a new  <START:person> Asterix <END>  album was due out in 2013, with  <START:person> Jean-Yves Ferri <END>  writing the story and  <START:person> Frédéric Mébarki <END>  drawing it.
A year later, in 2012, the publisher  <START:person> Albert-René <END>  announced that  <START:person> Frédéric Mébarki <END>  had withdrawn from drawing the new album, due to the pressure he felt in following in the steps of Uderzo.
Comic artist  <START:person> Didier Conrad <END>  was officially announced to take over drawing duties from Mébarki, with the due date of the new album in 2013 unchanged.
In January 2015, after the murders of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly  <START:person> Charlie Hebdo <END> , presumably for their controversial work, Astérix creator  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  came out of retirement to draw 2 Astérix pictures honoring the memories of the victims.
List of titles.
Numbers 1–24, 32 and 34 are by  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  and  <START:person> Uderzo <END> .
Numbers 25–31 and 33 are by  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  alone.
Years stated are for their initial release.
Number 35 is by  <START:person> Jean-Yves Ferri <END>  and   <START:person> Didier Conrad <END>  "Asterix Conquers Rome" is a comics adaptation of the animated film "The Twelve Tasks of Asterix".
It was released in 1976, and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be canonical to the series.
The only English translation ever to be published were in the "Asterix Annual 1980" and as a standalone volume in 1984.
In 2007, Les Editions  <START:person> Albert René <END>  released a tribute volume titled "Astérix et ses Amis", a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories.
It was a tribute to  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists.
The volume was translated into nine languages.
s of 2010[ [update]], it has not been translated into English.
Synopsis and characters.
The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village in Armorica (present-day Brittany), a province of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (modern France), in the year 50 BC.
 <START:person> Julius Caesar <END>  has conquered nearly all of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  for the Roman Republic.
The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, Getafix.
His chief is  <START:person> Vitalstatistix <END> .
The main protagonist and hero of the village is  <START:person> Asterix <END> , who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village.
He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and unintelligent friend,  <START:person> Obelix <END> , who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength.
 <START:person> Obelix <END>  is usually accompanied by  <START:person> Dogmatix <END> , his little dog.
(Except for  <START:person> Asterix <END>  and  <START:person> Obelix <END> , the names of the characters change with the language.
For example,  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's dog's name is "Dogmatix" in English, but "Idéfix" in the original French edition.)
 <START:person> Asterix <END>  and  <START:person> Obelix <END>  (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands.
Places visited in the series include parts of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (Lutetia, Corsica etc.), neighbouring nations (Belgium, Spain, Britain, Germany etc.), and far away lands (North America, Middle East, India etc.).
The series employs science-fiction and fantasy elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of extraterrestrials in " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and the Falling Sky" and the city of Atlantis in " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and Obelix All at Sea".
Humour.
The humour encountered in the "Asterix" comics is often centering on puns, caricatures, and tongue-in-cheek stereotypes of contemporary European nations and French regions.
Much of the humour in the initial  <START:person> Asterix <END>  books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story.
Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's famous "Ils sont fous ces romains" ("These Romans are crazy") is translated as " <START:person> Sono <END>  pazzi questi romani", alluding to the Roman abbreviation "SPQR".
In another example: Hiccups are written onomatopoeically in French as "hips," but in English as "hic," allowing Roman legionaries in at least one of the English translations to decline their hiccups in Latin ("hic, haec, hoc").
The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.
In spite of (or perhaps because of) this stereotyping, and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French chauvinism, the humour has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world.
Character names.
All the fictional characters in Asterix have names which are puns on their roles or personalities and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality.
Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an '-ix' suffix for the males and ending in '-a' for the females, for example, Chief Vitalstatistix (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife Impedimenta (often at odds with the chief).
The male Roman names end in '-us', echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in Gluteus Maximus, a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the butt of the joke.
Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in "-ic", after Gothic chiefs such as  <START:person> Alaric <END>  and Theoderic, for example Rhetoric the interpreter.
Greek names end in "-os" or "-es"; for example, Thermos the restaurateur.
British names end in "-ax" and are often puns on the taxation associated with the later United Kingdom, such as Valuaddedtax the druid and Selectivemploymentax the mercenary.
Other nationalities are treated to Pidgin translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning eggs and bacon, is often guidebook Spanish for tourists) or literary and other popular media references, like  <START:person> Dubbelosix <END>  (a reference to  <START:person> James Bond <END> 's codename 007).
Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation, for example, the druid Getafix is "Panoramix" in the original French and "Miraculix" in German.
Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved:  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's dog, known in the original French as "Idéfix" (from "idée fixe", a "fixed idea" or obsession), is called "Dogmatix" in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely ("dogmatic") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable "Dog-" at the beginning of the name.
The name " <START:person> Asterix <END> ", French "Astérix", comes from "astérisque", meaning "asterisk", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ ("aster"), meaning a "star").
His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local alphabets.
For example, in Esperanto, Polish, Slovene, Latvian, and Turkish it is "Asteriks".
In Turkish he was first named "Bücür" meaning "shorty", but the name was then changed.
An exception is in Icelandic, in which he is known as "Ástríkur" ("Rich of love").
In Sinhalese, the name is සිංහල ("Soora Pappa"), which can be interpreted as "Hero".
For explanations of some of the other names, see List of Asterix characters.
Translations.
The 35 volumes have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects.
Besides the original French language, most albums are available in Estonian, English, Czech, Dutch, German, Galician, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, modern Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Slovene, Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, Latvian,  <START:person> Welsh <END>  as well as Latin.
Some albums have also been translated into languages such as Esperanto, Scottish Gaelic, Indonesian, Persian, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Frisian, Romansch, Vietnamese, Sinhalese and Ancient Greek.
In France, Finland, and especially in Germany, several volumes were translated into a variety of regional languages and dialects, such as Alsatian, Breton,  <START:person> Chtimi <END>  ( <START:person> Picard <END> ) and Corsican in France, Bavarian, Swabian and Low German in Germany, and  <START:person> Savo <END> , Karelia, Rauma and Helsinki slang dialects in Finland.
Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume,  <START:person> Asterix <END>  the Gaul, was translated into local language Mirandese.
In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the Cretan Greek, Cypriot Greek and Pontic Greek dialects.
In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the Romanesque dialect.
In former Yugoslavia, "Forum" publishing house translated Corsican in "Asterix in Corsica" into Montenegrin dialect of Serbo-Croatian (today called Montenegrin language).
In the Netherlands several volumes were translated into Frisian, a language related to English spoken in the province of Friesland.
Also in the Netherlands two volumes were translated into Limburgish, a regional language spoken not only in Dutch Limburg but also in Belgian Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Hungarian-language books have been issued in Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia.
Although not a fully autonomous dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in Hungary.
In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into Sinhala ("Singhalese") as  <START:person> Sura Pappa <END> , the only Sri Lankan translation of a foreign cartoon that managed to keep the spirit of the original series intact.
Most volumes have been translated into Latin and Ancient Greek with accompanying teachers' guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages.
English translation.
The translation of the books into English has been done by  <START:person> Derek Hockridge <END>  and  <START:person> Anthea Bell <END> , and their English language rendition has been widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French version.
Adaptations.
The series has been adapted into various media.
Films.
Various motion pictures based upon the series have been made.
Games.

</dl>  Algebraic extension  In abstract algebra, a field extension "L"/"K" is called algebraic if every element of "L" is algebraic over "K", i.e. if every element of "L" is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in "K".
Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain transcendental elements, are called transcendental.
For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q(√2)/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers.
All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree.
This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic.
The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic.
For instance, the field of all algebraic numbers is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.
If "a" is algebraic over "K", then "K"["a"], the set of all polynomials in "a" with coefficients in "K", is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of "K" which has finite degree over "K".
The converse is true as well, if "K"["a"] is a field, then "a" is algebraic over "K".
In the special case where "K" = Q is the field of rational numbers, Q["a"] is an example of an algebraic number field.
A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called algebraically closed.
An example is the field of complex numbers.
Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice.
An extension "L"/"K" is algebraic if and only if every sub "K"-algebra of "L" is a field.
Properties.
The class of algebraic extensions forms a distinguished class of field extensions, that is, the following three properties hold: These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction:  This fact, together with  <START:person> Zorn <END> 's lemma (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of algebraic closures.
Generalizations.
Model theory generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of "M" into "N" is called an algebraic extension if for every "x" in "N" there is a formula "p" with parameters in "M", such that "p"("x") is true and the set is finite.
It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension.
The  <START:person> Galois <END>  group of "N" over "M" can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of  <START:person> Galois <END>  groups can be developed for the general case.
Aster CT-80  The Aster CT-80, an early (1982) home/personal computer developed by the small Dutch company MCP (later renamed to Aster Computers), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists.
Later it was sold ready to use.
It consisted of several Eurocard PCB's with DIN 41612 connectors, and a backplane all based on a 19-inch rack configuration.
It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer.
The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy TRS-80 computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run CP/M software, with a big amount of free memory Transient Program Area, (TPA) and a full 80×25 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal.
Although the Aster was a clone of the TRS-80 Model I it was in fact more compatible with the TRS-80 Model III, and ran all the software of these systems including games.
It also had a built in speaker which was compatible with such games software.
Models.
Three models were sold.
The first model (launched June 1982) looked like the later IBM PC (which came on the market years later), a rectangular base unit with two floppy drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard.
The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5¼" floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened Apple with a built-in keyboard.
All units ran much faster than the original TRS-80, at 4 MHz, (with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic), and an improved character font set.
The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 KB, more than four times the capacity of the original TRS-80.
A special version of NewDos/80, (an improved TRS-DOS compatible Disk operating system) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.
For the educational market a version of the first model was produced with a new plastic enclosure (the First Asters had an all-metal enclosure) that also had an opening on the top in which a cassette recorder could be placed.
This model was used in a cluster with one Aster (with disk drives) for the teacher, and eight disk less versions for the pupils.
The pupils could download software from the teachers computer through a network based on a fast serial connection, as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer.
There was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor.
Working modes.
The Aster used 64KB of RAM memory and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy or with a TRS-DOS floppy, the Aster would be fully TRS-80 compatible, with 48KB or RAM.
When the boot loader detected a CP/M floppy, the Aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free RAM for programs (TPA) and an 80 x 25 display.
This dual-architecture capability only existed on one other TRS-80 clone, the LOBO Max-80.
With a special configuration tool, the CT-80 could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.
A third mode was entered with a special boot floppy which turned the Aster into a Videotex terminal with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in RS232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.
Sales.
Most Aster CT-80's (about 10 thousand of them) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the "honderd scholen project" (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools.
MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands.
Another important demand was that the computers could be used in a network (Aster developed special software and hardware for that).
Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to Philips and their P2000 homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the technical demands, was made in Austria and did not have network hard nor software.
The company.
Aster computers was based in the small town of Arkel near the town of Gorinchem.
Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music.
The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time .
They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the "junior Computer" from  <START:person> Elektor <END>  (a copy of the KIM-1), and the ZX80 from  <START:person> Sinclair <END> .
Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers.
But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the WD1771 floppy disc controller chip without an external "data separator".
To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation.
Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable.
So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure.
The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64 KB RAM chips.
While this went on MCP renamed itself to "MCP CHIP" but ran into problems with the German computer magazine CHIP, and had to return to its former name.
At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the TRS-80, the Video Genie, (another TRS-80 clone), the Luxor ABC 80 and the Apple II.
They also sold the exotic Olivetti M20, a very early 16 bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a Z8000 CPU.
After designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface.
They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas.
The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low.
Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80.
So they decided to designed a TRS-80 and CP/M software compatible computer system, which (following the lead of Apple Computer) they decided to name after a "typical Dutch flower".
So they called it the Aster CT-80 (CP/M/Tandy-1980).
Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that "Aster" is also a Dutch girls name has something to do with it.
Remarkably "Aster" was also the name given to a Dutch Supercomputer much later, in 2002.
The first version of the Aster consisted of four "Eurocard's", one Z80 CPU card with 64KB memory, one Motorola MC6845 based video card, one double density floppy disk controller card and one "keyboard/RS232/cassette interface" card.
Plus a "backplane card", (which connected all the other cards) and a keyboard.
And was intended for hobbyists, to be sold as a kit consisting of the parts and the PCB's for the computer and attached keyboard.
After selling a few kits, MCP became convinced there was a much bigger market for an improved model sold as a completed working system.
However the original kit version lacked many features that prevented its use as a serious computer system.
Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, (adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80/64 column text mode support, (with different size letters for TRS-80 and CP/M mode, so that in TRS-80 mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64x16 portion of the 80x25 screen) with an improved font set (adding "gray scale" version of the TRS-80 mozaik graphics and many special PETSCII like characters), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, (in the form of a 19-inch rack for the Eurocards) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply.
A software engineer was hired to write the special "dual boot mode" BIOS and the special CP/M BIOS.
The "dual boot mode" BIOS actually discovered whether a TRS-DOS, or Aster CP/M disk was placed in the drive, and would, depending on the type of disk, reorganise the internal memory architecture of the system, to either be 100% TRS-80 compatible or optimally support CP/M, with as much "workspace" as possible, and the 80x25 video mode.
It also was responsible for switching to ROM BASIC when the system was turned on with the break key pressed, and later supported a primitive LAN system, using the RS232 port with modified cabling.
The very first of the ready made computers were sold with the "kit" versions of the euro cards, the version with redesigned cards came a month or so later.
Soon the little shop became much too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby (formerly a window glass factory), and started mass-producing the Aster for a period of a few years, in which time its staff grew twentyfold.
After the Aster having been a few years on the Market Tandy released its own improved model, the TRS-80 Model III computer which solved many of the same problems that the Aster also had solved, but the model 3 still did not fully support CP/M as the Aster did.
In the meantime IBM had released its original IBM PC, which incidentally looked remarkably like the Asters base with floppy drives + separate keyboard set-up.
The aster was chosen for Dutch schools by the Dutch ministry of education, in a set-up with eight disk-less Asters, and one Aster with high capacity floppy drives all connected by a LAN based on the Asters high-speed serial port hardware, and special cables that permitted that any single computer on the LAN could broadcast to all other computers.
The floppy based system was operated by the teacher who could send programs from his floppy disk, and data, to the student's disk-less systems thanks to the special BIOS in those systems.
The students could send programs and data back to the teacher through the same LAN, or could save to a cassette recorder built into the disk-less units.
Through a special "video-switch" the teacher was also able to see a copy of each students display on his own screen.
About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.
Unfortunately, because of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.
Perhaps the Aster computer inspired another Dutch computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower — the Tulip's Tulip System-1 which appeared about the same time Aster folded.
Most of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) MSX system for a company called "Micro Technology b.v.".
Unreleased add ons.
To enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system).
A hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a SCSI interface, and the necessary software.
A working prototype was developed that added a 40MB hard disk.
On the software front, work was being done to implement the replacement for the aging "user interface" of CP/M, (the Command Console Processor CCP ) with the more modern ZCPR.
Finally a replacement for the aging Z80 processor was being developed in the form of an Intel 8086 board, and additional 512K 16 bit memory boards.
Such replacements of CPU and memory system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that was designed to support both 8 and 16 bit processors, and used a modular Eurocard based design with slots to spare for expansion.
In theory the system could support the Z80 and the 8086 simultaneously.
Plans were formulated to support CP/M-86 and even MS-DOS.
Unfortunately none of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before any of them could be released.
Atlanta Braves  The Atlanta Braves are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team in Atlanta, Georgia, playing in the Eastern Division of the National League.
The Braves have played home games at Turner Field since 1997 and play spring training games in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.
In 2017, the team is to move to SunTrust Park, a new stadium complex in the Cumberland district of Cobb County just north of the I-285 bypass.
The "Braves" name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for a Native American warrior.
They are nicknamed "the "Bravos"", and often referred to as "America's Team" in reference to the team's games being broadcast on the nationally available TBS from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a wide fan base.
From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period (omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions).
The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and they returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010.
The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995.
Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 16 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants, and three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta.
The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities.
The club is one of the National League's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the Chicago Cubs) and was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings (not to be confused with the American League's Boston Red Sox).
They are considered "the oldest continuously playing team in major North American sports."
There is an argument as to which team is actually older, because, although the Cubs are a full season "older" (formed as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870), Chicago did not sponsor a White Stockings team for two seasons due to the Great Chicago Fire; therefore, the Braves have played more consecutive seasons.
After various name changes, the team eventually began operating as the Boston Braves, which lasted for most of the first half of the 20th century.
Then, in 1953, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves, followed by the final move to Atlanta in 1966.
The team's tenure in Atlanta is noted for  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END>  breaking  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END> 's career home run record in 1974.
History.
Boston.
1870–1913.
The Cincinnati Red Stockings, established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season.
Player-manager  <START:person> Harry Wright <END> , with brother  <START:person> George <END>  and two other Cincinnati players, then went to Boston Massachusetts at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder  <START:person> Ivers Whitney Adams <END>  to form the nucleus of the "Boston Red Stockings", a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP).
The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports.
(The only other team that has been organized as long, the Chicago Cubs, did not play for the two years following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.)
Two young players hired away from the Forest City club of Rockford, Illinois, turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher  <START:person> Al Spalding <END>  (founder of Spalding sporting goods) and second baseman  <START:person> Ross Barnes <END> .
Led by the  <START:person> Wright <END>  brothers,  <START:person> Barnes <END> , and  <START:person> Spalding <END> , the Red Stockings dominated the National Association, winning four of that league's five championships.
The team became one of the National League's charter franchises in 1876, sometimes called the "Red Caps" (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member).
Boston came to be called the "Beaneaters" in 1883, while retaining red as the team color.
The Boston Red Caps played in the first game in the history of the National League, on Saturday, April 22, 1876, defeating the Athletics, 6-5.
Although somewhat stripped of talent in the National League's inaugural year, Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants.
The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants.
For most of that time, their manager was  <START:person> Frank Selee <END> .
The 1898 team finished 102–47, a club record for wins that would stand for almost a century.
Stars of those 1890s  <START:person> Beaneater <END>  teams included the "Heavenly Twins",  <START:person> Hugh Duffy <END>  and  <START:person> Tommy McCarthy <END> , as well as "Slidin'"  <START:person> Billy Hamilton <END> .
The team was decimated when the American League's new Boston entry set up shop in 1901.
Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match.
They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913, and lost 100 games five times.
In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in "The Sporting News Baseball Guide" during the 1940s when each team's entry had a history of its nickname(s).
See details in History of baseball team nicknames).
The American League club's owner,  <START:person> Charles Taylor <END> , wasted little time in adopting Red Sox as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic "Americans").
Media-driven nickname changes to the "Doves" in 1907 and the "Rustlers" in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck.
The team became the "Braves" for the first time in 1912.
Their owner,  <START:person> James Gaffney <END> , was a member of New York City's political machine, Tammany Hall, which used an Indian chief as their symbol.
1914: Miracle.
Two years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history.
After a dismal 4–18 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last place finish.
On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Dodgers.
The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place, "15 games" behind the league-leading New York Giants, who had won the previous three league pennants.
After a day off, the Braves started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41–12.
On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three from the New York Giants and moved into first place.
The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16–16.
They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.
They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.
Despite their amazing comeback, the Braves entered the World Series as a heavy underdog to  <START:person> Connie Mack <END> 's Philadelphia A's.
Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics—the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern World Series (the 1907 Series had one tied game) to win the world championship.
Meanwhile,  <START:person> Johnny Evers <END>  won the Chalmers Award.
The Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at Fenway Park, since their normal home, the South End Grounds, was too small.
However, the Braves' success inspired owner  <START:person> Gaffney <END>  to build a modern park, Braves Field, which opened in August 1915.
It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield.
The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.
1915–1953.
After contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932.
The lone highlight of those years came when Judge  <START:person> Emil Fuchs <END>  bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great  <START:person> Christy Mathewson <END> , back into the game.
However,  <START:person> Mathewson <END>  died in 1925, leaving  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  in control of the team.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome.
The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager  <START:person> Bill McKechnie <END> , but  <START:person> Fuchs <END> ' revenue was severely depleted due to the Great Depression.
Looking for a way to get more fans and more money,  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  worked out a deal with the New York Yankees to acquire  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END> , who had started his career with the Red Sox.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  made  <START:person> Ruth <END>  team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits.
He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  even suggested that  <START:person> Ruth <END> , who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once  <START:person> McKechnie <END>  stepped down—perhaps as early as 1936.
At first, it appeared that  <START:person> Ruth <END>  was the final piece the team needed in 1935.
On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 win over the Giants.
However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500
all year.
Events went downhill quickly.
While  <START:person> Ruth <END>  could still hit, he could do little else.
He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if  <START:person> Ruth <END>  were in the lineup.
It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and  <START:person> Fuchs <END> ' promise of a share of team profits was hot air.
In fact,  <START:person> Ruth <END>  discovered that  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  expected him to invest some of "his" money in the team.
Seeing a franchise in complete disarray,  <START:person> Ruth <END>  retired on June 1—only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three home runs of his career.
He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.
The Braves finished 38–115, the worst season in franchise history.
Their .248
winning percentage is the third-worst in baseball history, and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the 1899 Cleveland Spiders).
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  lost control of the team in August 1935, and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the "Boston Bees".
This did little to change the team's fortunes.
After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate  <START:person> Lou Perini <END> , changed the nickname back to the Braves.
He immediately set about rebuilding the team.
World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of  <START:person> Warren Spahn <END>  to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.
In 1948, the team won the pennant, behind the pitching of  <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Johnny Sain <END> , who won 39 games between them.
The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, "Boston Post" writer  <START:person> Gerald Hern <END>  wrote this poem about the pair: The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as " <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Sain <END>  and pray for rain", entered the baseball vocabulary.
However, in the 1948 season, the Braves actually had the same record in games that  <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Sain <END>  started that the team had overall, in terms of winning percentage.
The 1948 World Series, which the Braves lost in six games to the Indians, turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston.
In 1950,  <START:person> Sam Jethroe <END>  became the team's first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18.
Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953,  <START:person> Perini <END> , who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to Milwaukee, where the Braves had their top farm club, the Brewers.
Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation.
 <START:person> Bill Veeck <END>  had tried to return his St. Louis Browns there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.
Milwaukee (1953–1965).
Milwaukee went wild over the Braves, who were welcomed as genuine heroes.
The Braves finished 92–62 in their first season in Milwaukee, and drew a then-NL record 1.8 million fans.
The success of the team was noted by many owners.
Not coincidentally, the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns, Brooklyn Dodgers, and New York Giants would leave their original hometowns within the next five years.
As the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive.
Sluggers  <START:person> Eddie Mathews <END>  and  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END>  drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee), while  <START:person> Warren Spahn <END> ,  <START:person> Lew Burdette <END> , and  <START:person> Bob Buhl <END>  anchored the rotation.
The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.
In 1957, the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's MVP season, as he led the National League in home runs and RBI.
Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run walk-off home run that gave the Braves a 4–2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and clinched the League championship.
The team then went on to its first World Series win in over 40 years, defeating the New York Yankees of Berra,  <START:person> Mantle <END> , and Ford in seven games.
 <START:person> Burdette <END> , the Series MVP, threw three complete game victories, giving up only two earned runs.
In 1958, the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the New York Yankees once more, thanks in part to the strength of  <START:person> Spahn <END> 's and  <START:person> Burdette <END> 's pitching.
But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP  <START:person> Bob Turley <END> 's pitching.
The 1959 season saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers, both with 86-68 records.
Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about 75 mi apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers.
The Dodgers would go on to defeat the Chicago White Sox in the World Series.
The next six years were up-and-down for the Braves.
The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by  <START:person> Burdette <END>  and  <START:person> Spahn <END> , and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, who ultimately were to win the World Series that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher  <START:person> Harvey Haddix <END> .
The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite  <START:person> Spahn <END>  recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  hit 45 home runs in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth.
The next season,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and  <START:person> Spahn <END>  was once again the ace of the staff, going 23–7.
However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the lower half of the league, or "second division", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.
The Braves were somewhat mediocre as the 1960s began, but fattened up on the expansion New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s.
To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team who played more than one season and never had a losing record.
 <START:person> Perini <END>  sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by  <START:person> William Bartholomay <END>  in 1962.
Almost immediately  <START:person> Bartholomay <END>  started shopping the Braves to a larger television market.
Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor  <START:person> Ivan Allen <END> ,  <START:person> Jr. <END>  constructed a new $18 million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, Atlanta Stadium, which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team.
After the city failed to lure the Kansas City A's to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season.
However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year.
In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.
 <START:person> Eddie Mathews <END>  is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in.
 <START:person> Mathews <END>  played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.
Atlanta.
1966–1974.
The Braves were a .500
team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85–77 in 1966, 77–85 in 1967, and 81–81 in 1968.
The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston.
In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever National League West Division title, before being swept by the "Miracle Mets" in the National League Championship Series.
They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 – in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.
In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END> .
In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium ("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production.
Atlanta also produced batting champions in  <START:person> Rico Carty <END>  (in 1970) and  <START:person> Ralph Garr <END>  (in 1974).
In the shadow of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 –  <START:person> Darrell Evans <END> ,  <START:person> Davey Johnson <END>  and, of course,  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
By the end of the 1973 season,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  had hit 713 home runs, one short of  <START:person> Ruth <END> 's record.
Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure.
The next season, it was only a matter of time before he set a new record.
On April 4, opening day, he hit No.714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience he finally beat  <START:person> Ruth <END> 's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before asking to be traded to the Milwaukee Brewers, while  <START:person> Ruth <END>  finished his career as a Boston Brave.
In fact, until  <START:person> Barry Bonds <END>  eclipsed the 714 home runs hit by  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END>  in 2006, the top two home run hitters in Major League history had at one time been Braves.
1976–77:  <START:person> Ted Turner <END>  buys the team.
In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> , owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta.
The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment.
It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
 <START:person> Turner <END>  quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner.
On May 11, 1977,  <START:person> Turner <END>  appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2–1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).
Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base.
WTBS marketed the team as "The Atlanta Braves: America's Team", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South.
Among other things, in 1976  <START:person> Turner <END>  suggested the nickname "Channel" for pitcher  <START:person> Andy Messersmith <END>  and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired Braves games.
Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.
1978–1990.
After three straight losing seasons,  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season.
He promoted 22-year-old slugger  <START:person> Dale Murphy <END>  into the starting lineup.
 <START:person> Murphy <END>  hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base.
In 1980,  <START:person> Murphy <END>  was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974.
 <START:person> Cox <END>  was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with  <START:person> Joe Torre <END> , under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969.
Strong performances from  <START:person> Bob Horner <END> ,  <START:person> Chris Chambliss <END> , pitcher  <START:person> Phil Niekro <END> , and short relief pitcher  <START:person> Gene Garber <END>  helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than  <START:person> Murphy <END> , who won both a Most Valuable Player and a Gold Glove award.
 <START:person> Murphy <END>  also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s.
 <START:person> Murphy <END> , excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990.
Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games.
The 1986 season saw the return of  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  as general manager.
Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Native American-themed mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa.
1991–2004: Division dominance.
1991–1994.
 <START:person> Cox <END>  returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing  <START:person> Russ Nixon <END> .
The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97.
They traded  <START:person> Dale Murphy <END>  to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player.
Pitching coach  <START:person> Leo Mazzone <END>  began developing young pitchers  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END> ,  <START:person> Steve Avery <END> , and  <START:person> John Smoltz <END>  into future stars.
That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB Draft to select  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END> , who became one of the best hitters in team history.
Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office.
Immediately after the season,  <START:person> John Schuerholz <END>  was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.
The following season,  <START:person> Glavine <END> ,  <START:person> Avery <END> , and  <START:person> Smoltz <END>  would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them.
Meanwhile, behind position players  <START:person> David Justice <END> ,  <START:person> Ron Gant <END>  and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion  <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END> , the Braves overcame a 39–40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races.
The "Worst to First" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag.
They defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in a very tightly contested seven-game NLCS only to lose the World Series, also in seven games, to the Minnesota Twins.
The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.
Despite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue.
In 1992, the Braves returned to the NLCS and once again defeated the Pirates in seven games, culminating in a dramatic game seven win.
 <START:person> Francisco Cabrera <END> 's two-out single that scored  <START:person> David Justice <END>  and  <START:person> Sid Bream <END>  capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3–2 victory.
It was the first time in post season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning.
The Braves lost the World Series to the Toronto Blue Jays, however.
In 1993, the Braves signed Cy Young Award winning pitcher  <START:person> Greg Maddux <END>  from the Chicago Cubs, leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball.
The 1993 team posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the San Francisco Giants, who won 103 games.
The Braves needed a stunning 55–19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11.
However, the Braves fell in the NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.
In 1994, in a realignment of the National League's divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.
This realignment was the main cause of the team's heated rivalry with the New York Mets during the mid-to-late 1990s.
The player's strike cut short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the Montreal Expos with 48 games left to play.
1995–2004.
The Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series.
This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the "Buffalo Bills of Baseball" (January 1996 issue of "Beckett Baseball Card Monthly").
With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities.
With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the 1996 and 1999 World Series (losing both to the New York Yankees, managed by  <START:person> Joe Torre <END> , a former Braves manager), and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early.
Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization —Cox was the Braves' manager, while  <START:person> Schuerholz <END>  remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president.
 <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END>  finished his playing career elsewhere, but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.
In October 1996, Time Warner acquired  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> 's Turner Broadcasting System and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves.
Over the next few years,  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> 's presence as owner of the team would diminish.
A 95–67 record in 2000 produced a ninth consecutive division title.
However, a sweep at the hands of the St. Louis Cardinals prevented the Braves from reaching the National League Championship Series for a ninth consecutive time.
In 2001, Atlanta won the National League East division yet again, swept the Houston Astros in the NLDS, then lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Championship Series four games to one.
One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played rival New York Mets in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since 9/11.
In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Houston Astros.
 <START:person> Cy Young <END>  dominance.
Six National League Cy Young Awards in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers: 2005: A new generation.
In 2005, the Braves won the Division championship for the fourteenth consecutive time from 1991 to 2005.
Fourteen consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball.
The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs ( <START:person> Wilson Betemit <END> ,  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> ,  <START:person> Pete Orr <END> ,  <START:person> Ryan Langerhans <END> ,  <START:person> Jeff Francoeur <END> ).
Catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> , right fielder  <START:person> Jeff Francoeur <END> , and pitcher  <START:person> Kyle Davies <END>  all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta.
The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the "Baby Braves" by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to a record of 90–72.
However, the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the National League Division Series to the Astros in four games.
In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros battled back with a  <START:person> Lance Berkman <END>  grand slam and a two-out, ninth inning  <START:person> Brad Ausmus <END>  home run off of Braves closer  <START:person> Kyle Farnsworth <END> .
The game did not end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50 minutes.
 <START:person> Chris Burke <END>  ended the marathon with a home run off of  <START:person> Joey Devine <END> .
After the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach  <START:person> Leo Mazzone <END> , who left to go to the Baltimore Orioles.
 <START:person> Roger McDowell <END>  took his place in the Atlanta dugout.
Unable to re-sign shortstop  <START:person> Rafael Furcal <END> , the Braves acquired shortstop  <START:person> Edgar Rentería <END>  from the Boston Red Sox.
2006: Struggles.
In 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to.
Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6–21 record for the month of June, the worst month ever in the city of Atlanta, and just percentage points better than the Boston Braves of May 1935 (4–20).
The Braves made their move in July, going 14–10.
However, the team remained in the bottom half of the NL East and trailed the Mets by a double-digit deficit for much of the season (13 games at the All-Star Break).
However, despite their struggles, the Braves entered the break down by only six and a half games to the Dodgers for the NL Wild Card slot after winning seven of their last ten games.
After the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records.
They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span.
The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the Boston Beaneaters totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 – June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the 1930 New York Yankees to score ten runs or more in five straight games.
The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8–3 victory over Cincinnati on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break.
Additionally,  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie  <START:person> Paul Waner <END> 's 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.
The Braves made their first trade of the season on July 20 to shore up the bullpen, sending Class A Rome catcher  <START:person> Max Ramirez <END>  to Cleveland for closer  <START:person> Bob Wickman <END> .
He served as the Braves' closer for the remainder of the season, taking over for an embattled  <START:person> Jorge Sosa <END> , who was subsequently traded on the July 31 trade deadline for St. Louis minor league pitcher  <START:person> Rich Scalamandre <END> .
On July 29, the Braves traded reserve third baseman/shortstop  <START:person> Wilson Betemit <END>  to the Los Angeles Dodgers for reliever  <START:person> Danys Báez <END>  and infielder  <START:person> Willy Aybar <END> .
The move came on the night that starting third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  went on the 15-day disabled list with a strained oblique muscle.
With  <START:person> Betemit <END>  gone, Atlanta called up infielder  <START:person> Tony Pena <END> , Jr. from AAA Richmond to supplement  <START:person> Pete Orr <END> .
Before the expansion of rosters on September 1, the Braves acquired  <START:person> Daryle Ward <END>  from the Washington Nationals for Class A Myrtle Beach pitcher  <START:person> Luis Atilano <END> , in hopes that he would be a valuable pinch-hitter in the postseason.
However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the Florida Marlins mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves' eleven-year reign over the NL East.
On September 24, the Braves' loss to the Colorado Rockies mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season.
Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990.
Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie  <START:person> Chuck James <END>  besting  <START:person> Roger Clemens <END> , Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79–83.
After the season, the Atlanta coaching staff underwent a few changes.
 <START:person> Brian Snitker <END>  became the third base coach after  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  left to become the manager for the Florida Marlins.
 <START:person> Chino Cadahia <END>  replaced  <START:person> Pat Corrales <END>  as bench coach and former catcher  <START:person> Eddie Pérez <END>  became the new bullpen coach, replacing  <START:person> Bobby Dews <END> .
Sale to Liberty Media.
In December 2005, team owner Time Warner, who inherited the Braves after purchasing TBS in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale.
Liberty Media began negotiations to purchase the team.
In February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal that would sell the Braves to Liberty Media Group (a company which owned a large amount of stock in Time Warner, Inc.), pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball,  <START:person> Bud Selig <END> .
The deal included the exchange of the Braves, valued in the deal at $450 million, a hobbyist magazine publishing company, and $980 million cash, for 68.5 million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty Media, then worth approximately $1.48 billion.
Team President  <START:person> Terry McGuirk <END>  anticipated no change in the current front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day operations of the Braves.
Liberty Media is not expected to take any type of "active" ownership in terms of day-to-day operations.
On May 16, 2007, Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale of the Braves from Time Warner to Liberty Media.
2007: More struggles.
The Braves made their first moves by re-signing  <START:person> Bob Wickman <END>  to a one-year deal and picking up  <START:person> John Smoltz <END> 's option in September 2006.
They traded starting pitcher  <START:person> Horacio Ramírez <END>  to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher  <START:person> Rafael Soriano <END> , an American League reliever with a 2.20 ERA in 2006.
They also denied arbitration to pitcher  <START:person> Chris Reitsma <END>  and second baseman  <START:person> Marcus Giles <END> .
The Braves signed utility-man  <START:person> Chris Woodward <END>  to fill a spot on the bench.
The biggest trade in the offseason involved first baseman  <START:person> Adam LaRoche <END>  and a minor league player for Pittsburgh Pirates closer  <START:person> Mike González <END>  and a minor league infielder,  <START:person> Brent Lillibridge <END> .
 <START:person> Gonzalez <END> , who converted 24 of 24 save opportunities in 2006, joined  <START:person> Soriano <END>  as a set-up man for  <START:person> Wickman <END>  in the bullpen.
The team then signed  <START:person> Craig Wilson <END>  to a one-year deal to platoon with  <START:person> Scott Thorman <END> .
The Braves also had solid relievers in  <START:person> Macay McBride <END> ,  <START:person> Blaine Boyer <END> , and  <START:person> Tyler Yates <END> .
In addition, the majority of the Braves' offense, which was second in the NL in runs scored in 2006, returned in 2007.
However,  <START:person> Mike Hampton <END>  was sidelined for the entire 2007 season with yet another surgery.
 <START:person> Mike González <END>  was later sidelined for the season while recovering from  <START:person> Tommy John <END>  surgery.
The Braves' bullpen and offense came through in the clutch early on, helping the Braves to a 7–1 start, their best start since winning the World Series in 1995.
The team finished April with a 16–9 record, but struggled during May, finishing 14–14.
The Braves also struggled during interleague play, finishing with an NL-worst 4–11 record.
On June 24, the Braves fell to .500 for the first time in the 2007 season, but rebounded by winning the next 5 games.
On July 5,  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  surpassed  <START:person> Dale Murphy <END>  for the Atlanta club record of 372 home runs by belting two against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
On July 31, 2007, the Braves finalized the deal to acquire slugger first baseman  <START:person> Mark Teixeira <END>  and LHP  <START:person> Ron Mahay <END>  from the Texas Rangers for catcher  <START:person> Jarrod Saltalamacchia <END> , SS  <START:person> Elvis Andrus <END> , and three minor-leaguers.
The Braves also acquired  <START:person> Octavio Dotel <END>  from the Kansas City Royals for  <START:person> Kyle Davies <END>  and also traded LHP  <START:person> Wilfredo Ledezma <END>  and RHP Will Startup to the San Diego Padres for Royce Ring.
On August 19, 2007  <START:person> John Smoltz <END>  passed  <START:person> Phil Niekro <END>  for 1st place on the Braves' all-time strikeout list.
Braves manager  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  broke the all-time MLB record for most career ejections by a manager in August 2007.
After struggling during the second half of the 2007 season, Atlanta finished over .500
and missed the post season again.
On October 12, 2007,  <START:person> John Schuerholz <END>  stepped down as General Manager to take over as team president.
Assistant GM  <START:person> Frank Wren <END>  took over as General Manager.
2008: Plagued by injuries.
In December 2007, the team announced it would not re-sign center fielder  <START:person> Andruw Jones <END>  (who later would sign with the Dodgers).
Another major move was acquiring CF  <START:person> Gorkys Hernández <END>  and RHP  <START:person> Jair Jurrjens <END>  from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for SS  <START:person> Edgar Rentería <END>  and cash considerations.
Next, LHP  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END>  was signed to a one-year contract.
They also acquired LHP  <START:person> Will Ohman <END>  and INF  <START:person> Omar Infante <END>  from the Cubs in exchange for RHP  <START:person> José Ascanio <END> .
The team's first new move for 2008 was acquiring OF  <START:person> Mark Kotsay <END>  from the A's (to replace  <START:person> Jones <END> ) in exchange for RHP  <START:person> Joey Devine <END> , RHP  <START:person> Jamie Richmond <END>  and cash considerations.
Days later,  <START:person> Wren <END>  traded  <START:person> Willy Aybar <END> , outfielder  <START:person> Tom Lindsey <END> , and infielder  <START:person> Chase Fontaine <END>  to the Rays in exchange for left-hand reliever  <START:person> Jeff Ridgway <END> .
Before the trade deadline the Braves traded 1B  <START:person> Mark Teixeira <END>  to the Los Angeles Angels for first baseman  <START:person> Casey Kotchman <END>  and minor league RHP  <START:person> Stephen Marek <END> .
The Braves failed to make the playoffs for the third straight season.
2009: The return of solid pitching.
On December 4, 2008, the Atlanta Braves received  <START:person> Javier Vázquez <END>  and  <START:person> Boone Logan <END> , while the Chicago White Sox received prospects catcher  <START:person> Tyler Flowers <END> , shortstop  <START:person> Brent Lillibridge <END> , third baseman  <START:person> Jon Gilmore <END>  and pitcher  <START:person> Santos Rodriguez <END> .
On January 13, 2009, the Braves signed Japanese pitcher  <START:person> Kenshin Kawakami <END>  to a three-year deal, and two days later signed free agent pitcher  <START:person> Derek Lowe <END>  to a four-year contract.
During the course of the offseason, the Braves signed veteran pitcher and former Brave  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END> , while losing long-time Brave  <START:person> John Smoltz <END>  to the Boston Red Sox.
On February 25, 2009, just before the start of spring training, Atlanta agreed to terms on a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder  <START:person> Garret Anderson <END> .
The additional outfield depth allowed the Braves to trade  <START:person> Josh Anderson <END>  to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher  <START:person> Rudy Darrow <END>  on March 30, 2009.
On June 3, 2009, the Braves acquired  <START:person> Nate McLouth <END>  from the Pittsburgh Pirates for prospects  <START:person> Jeff Locke <END> ,  <START:person> Charlie Morton <END>  and  <START:person> Gorkys Hernández <END> .
They also released veteran pitcher  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END> .
On July 10, 2009, the Braves traded outfielder  <START:person> Jeff Francoeur <END>  to the New York Mets for outfielder  <START:person> Ryan Church <END> .
On July 31, 2009, hours before the trade deadline, the Braves and Boston Red Sox swapped 1st basemen: Atlanta dealt  <START:person> Casey Kotchman <END>  to Boston and reacquired  <START:person> Adam LaRoche <END> , whom the Braves had traded away during the 2006–07 off-season to Pittsburgh.
The Braves made a late-season surge, coming within 2 games of the wild card leading Colorado Rockies in late September.
On October 1, 2009 with the Braves four games back, Colorado beat the Milwaukee Brewers 9–2 to clinch the wild card spot and end the Braves' 2009 postseason hopes.
2010: Cox's final season.
The 2010 Atlanta Braves Season features the Braves' attempt to reclaim a postseason berth for the first time since 2005.
The Braves were once again skippered by  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END> , now in his 25th and final season managing the team.
The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April.
Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since 2000 when they won 16 in a row.
On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place Philadelphia Phillies at Turner Field to take sole possession of first place in the National League East standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August.
The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in 2005.
On July 13, 2010 at the 2010 MLB All-Star Game in Anaheim, Braves catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END>  was awarded the All-Star Game MVP Award for his clutch two-out, three-run double in the seventh inning to give the National League its first win in the All-Star Game since 1996.
He became the first Brave to win the All-Star Game MVP Award since  <START:person> Fred McGriff <END>  did so in 1994.
The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire Álex González,  <START:person> Rick Ankiel <END>  and  <START:person> Kyle Farnsworth <END>  from the Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals, giving up shortstop  <START:person> Yunel Escobar <END> , pitchers  <START:person> Jo-Jo Reyes <END>  and  <START:person> Jesse Chavez <END> , outfielder  <START:person> Gregor Blanco <END>  and three minor leaguers.
On August 18, 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman  <START:person> Derrek Lee <END>  from the Chicago Cubs.
On August 22, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs,  <START:person> Mike Minor <END>  struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record.
The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September, but won the NL Wild Card.
They lost to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four games.
Every game of the series was determined by one run.
After the series-clinching victory for the Giants in Game 4,  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  was given a standing ovation by the fans, also by players and coaches of both the Braves and Giants.
2011:  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  takes over.
On October 13, 2010, the Atlanta Braves announced that  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  would replace long-time Braves manager  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  as manager of the team in 2011.
The announcement came just two days after the 2010 Braves were eliminated from the postseason.
It was also announced that pitching coach  <START:person> Roger McDowell <END> , third-base coach  <START:person> Brian Snitker <END> , and bullpen coach  <START:person> Eddie Pérez <END>  would retain their current positions, while former hitting coach  <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END>  would replace  <START:person> Glenn Hubbard <END>  as the first-base coach and newcomer  <START:person> Carlos Tosca <END>  would become the new bench coach.
 <START:person> Hubbard <END>  and former bench coach  <START:person> Chino Cadahia <END>  were not offered positions on the new coaching staff.
 <START:person> Larry Parrish <END>  was hired as hitting coach on October 29, 2010.
On November 16, 2010 in an offseason trade, the Braves acquired  <START:person> Dan Uggla <END>  from the Florida Marlins in exchange for left-handed reliever  <START:person> Mike Dunn <END>  and infielder  <START:person> Omar Infante <END> .
According to Elias Sports Bureau, the Braves had an all-time franchise win-loss record over .500
for the first time since 1923 after their win over the Houston Astros on June 11, 2011.
The Braves franchise became the third franchise in MLB history to reach 10,000 wins with their win over the Washington Nationals on July 15, 2011.
On July 31, 2011, just sixteen days after registering their 10,000th win, the Florida Marlins defeated the Braves by a score of 3-1, handing the team the 10,000th loss in franchise history.
The Braves become only the second team in big league history with 10,000 losses after the Philadelphia Phillies reached the plateau in 2007.
Players from the Braves' farm system, such as  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  and  <START:person> Brandon Beachy <END> , played regularly with the big league club, while  <START:person> Julio Teherán <END> ,  <START:person> Randall Delgado <END> , and  <START:person> Mike Minor <END>  were called up for spot starts.
With late season injuries to starters  <START:person> Jair Jurrjens <END>  and  <START:person> Tommy Hanson <END> , these three young pitchers made their way into the starting rotation in their absence.
Eight players made their major league debuts for the team in 2011.
September collapse.
The Braves led the National League Wild Card standings for much of the 2011 season, with the division-rival Philadelphia Phillies firmly in control of first place in the National League East.
The Braves entered the final month of the regular season 25 games above .500
with a record of 80–55 and an 8 1⁄2-game lead in the Wild Card standings.
The nearest team trailing them, the St. Louis Cardinals, who also trailed the National League Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers by 8 1⁄2 games at the time, were considered a long-shot to gain a spot in the postseason.
Just days prior on August 26, the Cardinals found themselves 10 1⁄2 games behind and in third place.
With 27 games to play, the Braves went 9–18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89–73.
The Cardinals, meanwhile, went 18–8 to finish at 90–72.
Braves closer  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END> , who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August, carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves.
After being dominant in his role for much of the season, Braves setup man  <START:person> Jonny Venters <END>  posted a 5.11 September ERA.
These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by Braves manager  <START:person> Fredi González <END> .
Veteran starter  <START:person> Derek Lowe <END>  posted a win-loss record of 0–5 in September with an ERA of 8.75.
Shortly into the offseason,  <START:person> Lowe <END>  would be traded to the Cleveland Indians.
The Braves starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games.
Over the last five games, all of which were losses for the Braves, the team managed to score only seven runs.
Braves catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> , often regarded as the best offensive catcher in the Majors, hit only .183 with two home runs in September.
The offense as a whole hit for only a .235
batting average and a .300
on-base percentage in September, both second-worst in the National League.
The .195
RISP average by Braves hitters was second worst in the Majors.
Hitting coach  <START:person> Larry Parrish <END>  was fired two days following the last game of the season.
2012:  <START:person> Chipper <END> 's last season.
In 2012, the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season.
On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team.
The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher  <START:person> Derek Lowe <END> , shortstop  <START:person> Alex González <END> , and outfielder  <START:person> Nate McLouth <END> .
To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder  <START:person> Michael Bourn <END> , along with shortstops  <START:person> Tyler Pastornicky <END>  and  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END> .
To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by  <START:person> Lowe <END>  (as well as a mid-season injury to  <START:person> Brandon Beachy <END> ), manager  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  elected relief pitcher  <START:person> Kris Medlen <END>  to the starting pitching rotation.
The Braves went on to win every game  <START:person> Medlen <END>  started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23).
Atlanta stayed close to the Washington Nationals in the race to win the National League East title.
They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race.
Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild card race.
Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a playoff game before entering into the Division Series.
The Braves played the St. Louis Cardinals in the first ever Wild Card Game.
The Braves were behind 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END>  hit a fly ball to left field that dropped in between the Cardinals shortstop and left fielder.
Umpire  <START:person> Sam Holbrook <END>  called  <START:person> Simmons <END>  out, citing the infield fly rule.
Had an infield fly not been called,  <START:person> Simmons <END>  would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out.
Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes.
The Braves lost the game 6–3, ending their season.
2013: Braves win the East.
During the offseason following a gut wrenching exit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the Wild Card Game, the Braves spent the 2012-2013 offseason revamping and retooling their offense.
The Braves turned heads across baseball by acquiring  <START:person> B.J. Upton <END>  from the Tampa Bay Rays, signing him to a 5-year $75.25 million contract and making him their starting center fielder, and uniting him with his younger brother  <START:person> Justin Upton <END>  from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a seven player trade that sent fan favorite utility man  <START:person> Martin Prado <END>  to the Diamondbacks, they also filled a need for a new Third Baseman in  <START:person> Chris Johnson <END>  after the retirement of  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  the previous year.
The Braves began the 2013 season with a hot start in April by going 17-9 for the month, which saw the emergence of rookie sensation  <START:person> Evan Gattis <END> , while taking hold of first place in the National League East division, a lead they would never relinquish for the rest of the season.
The Braves suffered many injuries to key players throughout the season, including injuries to  <START:person> Jason Heyward <END> ,  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> ,  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END> ,  <START:person> Eric O'Flaherty <END> ,  <START:person> Jonny Venters <END> ,  <START:person> Ramiro Pena <END>  and others, but found a way to win despite these blows to the team.
Leading up to the All Star break, First Baseman  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  was voted in to play for the 2013 National League All-Star Team, in the 2013 All Star Game, which he did not play.
The Braves also witnessed the emergence of rookie pitcher  <START:person> Julio Teheran <END>  after much hype during Spring Training.
From July 26 to August 10, the Braves won 14 games in a row.
The winning streak was the longest of its kind since April–May 2000.
On June 28, 2013 the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END> ' jersey, number 10, before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
He was honored before 51,300 fans at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia.
He served as a staple of the Braves franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season.
 <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  played his last regular season game for the Braves on September 30, 2012.
The Braves opened up a 15-game lead on the Washington Nationals in the National League East on September 3, 2013, riding that lead en route to its first division title since 2005, the last of 14 straight division titles.
This was also Braves manager  <START:person> Fredi Gonzalez <END> 's first division title since beginning his managerial career in 1990; including his first since becoming the manager of the Braves after the 2010 season.
The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22, 2013 after a Nationals loss to the Marlins in the first game of a double header; the Braves also won their game that day, beating the Chicago Cubs 5-2 at Wrigley Field.
2014.
On November 11, 2013, the Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field for a new stadium in Cobb County, in the northwest suburbs outside of Atlanta in 2017.
The move is to follow the expiration of the Braves' 20-year lease on Turner Field in 2016.
The new stadium is to be constructed in a public/private partnership.
During the offseason the Braves signed few of their young talents to multi year contracts;  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END>  (4 years/$42M),  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  (8 years/$135M),  <START:person> Kris Medlen <END>  (1 year/$5.8M),
 <START:person> Jason Heyward <END>  (2 years/$13.3M),
 <START:person> Julio Teherán <END>  (6 years/$32.4M)
and  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END>  (7 years/$58M).
The Braves finished the season in a distant second place with a 79-83 record, which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990.
2015.
Prior to the 2015 season, the Braves fired their General Manager  <START:person> Frank Wren <END> , and  <START:person> John Hart <END>  replaced him as interim GM, choosing to only take the title of President of Baseball Operations.
The Braves promptly traded Gold Glove Award winner  <START:person> Jason Heyward <END>  to the St. Louis Cardinals along with pitcher  <START:person> Jordan Walden <END>  for pitchers  <START:person> Shelby Miller <END>  and  <START:person> Tyrell Jenkins <END> .
 <START:person> Hart <END>  would then trade All Star left fielder  <START:person> Justin Upton <END>  to the San Diego Padres for Max Fried,  <START:person> Jace Peterson <END> ,  <START:person> Dustin Peterson <END> , and  <START:person> Mallex Smith <END> .
Catcher  <START:person> Evan Gattis <END>  and minor league prospect  <START:person> James Hoyt <END>  were traded to the Houston Astros for minor leaguers  <START:person> Mike Foltynewicz <END> ,  <START:person> Rio Ruiz <END> , and  <START:person> Andrew Thurman <END> .
A day before the season began, the braves made a final trade involving former AllStar  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END>  and outfielder  <START:person> Melvin Upton Jr <END> ..
They were traded to the San Diego Padres for outfielders  <START:person> Cameron Maybin <END>  and  <START:person> Carlos Quentin <END>  along with two minor league players.
By the beginning of the season, the Braves did 11 trades in all.

Acadia University  Acadia University is a predominantly undergraduate university located in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada with some graduate programs at the master's level and one at the doctoral level.
The enabling legislation consists of Acadia University Act and the Amended Acadia University Act 2000.
The Wolfville Campus houses Acadia University Archives and the Acadia University Art Gallery.
Acadia offers over 200 degree combinations in the Faculties of Arts, Pure and Applied Science, Professional Studies, and Theology.
The student-faculty ratio is 15:1 and the average class size is 28.
Open Acadia offers correspondence and distance education courses.
History.
Acadia began as an extension of Horton Academy (1828), which was founded in Horton, Nova Scotia, by Baptists from Nova Scotia and Queen's College (1838).
The College was later named Acadia College.
Acadia University, established at Wolfville, Nova Scotia in 1838 has a strong Baptist religious affiliation.
It was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members.
The two major Universities of the day in Nova Scotia were heavily controlled by Denominational structures.
King's College (University of King's College) was an Anglican School and Dalhousie University, which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the Church of Scotland.
It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar,  <START:person> Edmund Crawley <END> , to the Chair of Classics, as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a College established and run by the Baptists.
In 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for  <START:person> Queen Victoria <END> ).
The College began with 21 students in January 1839.
The name "Queen's College" was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed "Acadia College" in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an Acadian settlement.
Acadia College awarded its first degrees in 1843 and became Acadia University in 1891, established by the Acadia University Act.
The Granville Street Baptist Church (now First Baptist Church (Halifax)) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the University.
It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development.
Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president  <START:person> John Pryor <END> , were members of the First Baptist Church Halifax congregation.
Similarly, the adjacent Wolfville United Baptist Church plays a significant role in the life of the university.
The original charter of the college stated: And be it further enacted, that no religious tests or subscriptions shall be required of the Professors Fellows, Scholars, Graduates or Officers of the said College; but that all the privileges and advantages thereof shall be open and free to all and every Person and Persons whomsoever, without regard to religious persuasion ...
And it shall and may be lawful for the trustees and Governors of the said College to select as Professors, and other Teaches or Officers, competent persons of any religious persuasion whatever, provided such person or persons shall be of moral and religious character.
This was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff.
In 1851, the power of appointing governors was transferred from the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces.
 <START:person> Charles Osborne Wickenden <END>  (architect), and  <START:person> J.C. Dumaresq <END>  designed the Central Building, Acadia College, 1878–79.
 <START:person> Clara Belle Marshall <END> , from Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia, became the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879.
In 1891, there were changes in the Act of Incorporation.

Today,  <START:person> Horton Hall <END>  is the home of the Department of Psychology and Research and Graduate Studies.
 <START:person> Emmerson Hall <END> , built in 1913, is particularly interesting for the variety of building stones used.
In 1967  <START:person> Emmerson Hall <END>  was converted to classrooms and offices for the School of Education.
It is a registered Heritage Property.
Unveiled on 16 August 1963, a wooden and metal organ in Manning Chapel, Acadia University, is dedicated to Acadia University's war dead of the First World War.
A memorial pipe organ in Convovation Hall, Acadia University is dedicated to the members of Acadia University killed during the First World War A book of remembrance in Manning Chapel, Acadia University was unveiled on 1 March 1998 through the efforts of the Wolfville Historical Society  In 1966, the Baptist denomination relinquished direct control over the University.
The denomination maintains nine seats on the University's Board of Governors.
On 4 January 2008, Dr.  <START:person> Gail Dinter-Gottlieb <END>  decided to step down as President and Vice Chancellor of the University before her term expired.
Her resignation was effective 29 February 2008.
 <START:person> Ray Ivany <END>  began his position as President and Vice-Chancellor on 1 April 2009.
Faculty strikes.
Acadia University's Board of Governors and members of the Acadia University Faculty Association (AUFA) have ratified a new covering the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2014.
The faculty of Acadia University have been on strike twice in the history of the institution.
The first was 24 February to 12 March 2004.
The second was 15 October to 5 November 2007.
The second strike was resolved after the province's labour minister,  <START:person> Mark Parent <END> , appointed a mediator, on 1 November, to facilitate an agreement.
Academics.
Profile.
As a primarily undergraduate institution, the university places significant importance on teaching and instruction.
The mission of Acadia University is to provide a personalized and rigorous liberal education; promote a robust and respectful scholarly community; and inspire a diversity of students to become critical thinkers, lifelong learners, engaged citizens, and responsible global leaders.
Rankings.
Acadia University is consistently ranked among the top universities in Canada for undergraduate studies in the  <START:person> Maclean <END> 's comprehensive Canadian Universities rankings, coming second in Canada for the 2014 academic year and among the top five for the past decade.
This has been attributed to Acadia's small class size and close relationships between the faculty and the students.
Faculties.
Acadia is organized into four faculties: Arts, Pure & Applied Science, Professional Studies and Theology.
Each faculty is further divided into departments and schools specialized in areas of teaching and research.
Research.
The Division of Research & Graduate Studies is separate from the faculties and oversees graduate students as well as Acadia's research programs.
Acadia's research programs explore coastal environments, ethno-cultural diversity, social justice, environmental monitoring and climate change, organizational relationships, data mining, the impact of digital technologies, and lifestyle choices contributing to health and wellness.
Acadia's research centres include the Tidal Energy Institute, and the Beaubassin Field Station.
Applied research opportunities include research with local wineries and grape growers, alternative insect control techniques and technologies.
Innovation.
The Acadia Advantage.
In 1996, Acadia University pioneered the use of mobile computing technology in a post-secondary educational environment.
This academic initiative, named the Acadia Advantage, integrated the use of notebook computers into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching.
By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were taking part in the initiative.
The initiative went beyond leasing notebook computers to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond.
Because of its pioneering efforts, Acadia is a laureate of Washington's Smithsonian Institution and a part of the permanent research collection of the National Museum of American History.
It is the only Canadian university selected for inclusion in the Education and Academia category of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award.
In addition, Acadia University received the Pioneer Award for Ubiquitous Computing.
In 2001, it achieved high rankings in the annual "Maclean's" University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum.
In October 2006, Dr.  <START:person> Dinter-Gottlieb <END>  established a commission to review the Acadia Advantage learning environment 10 years after inception.
The mandate of the commission was to determine how well the current Advantage program meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff and to examine how the role of technology in the postsecondary environment has changed at Acadia, and elsewhere.
The commission was asked to recommend changes and enhancements to the Acadia Advantage that would benefit the entire university community and ensure its sustainability.
Some of the recommendations coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased notebook computers to a student-owned computer model.
The compelling rationale for this was the integral role technology now plays in our lives, which was not present in 1996.
The University was also advised to unbundle its tuition structure so that the cost of an Acadia education is more detailed and students can understand how their investment in the future of the school is allotted.
In September 2008, Acadia moved to a student-owned notebook computer version of the Acadia Advantage, now named Acadia Advantage 2.0.
Athletics.
Acadia's sports teams are called the Axemen and Axewomen.
They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of Canadian Interuniversity Sport.
School spirit abounds with men's and women's varsity teams that have delivered more conference and national championships than any other institution in Atlantic University Sport.
Routinely, more than one-third of Acadia's varsity athletes also achieve Academic All-Canadian designation through Canadian Interuniversity Sport by maintaining a minimum average of 80 per cent.
Expansion and modernization of  <START:person> Raymond Field <END>  was completed in the fall of 2007 and features the installation of an eight-lane all-weather running track and a move to the same premium artificial turf used by the New England Patriots of the National Football League for its main playing field.
The Raymond Field modernization was a gift to the university by friends, alumni, and the province.
War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams.
In September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club and the Acadia Masters Swim Club to form the Acadia Swim Club and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14-year hiatus.
On 26 September 2008, the university announced its intention to return swimming to a varsity status in September 2009.

In 1974, Acadia was granted a coat of arms designed by the College of Arms in London, England.
The coat of arms is two-tone, with the school's official colours, garnet and blue, on the shield.
The axes represent the school's origins in a rural setting, and the determination of its founders who cleared the land and built the school on donated items and labour.
The open books represent the intellectual pursuits of a university, and the wolves heads are a whimsical representation of the University's location in Wolfville.
"In pulvere vinces" (In dust you conquer) is the motto.
The University seal depicts the Greek goddess of wisdom Athena in front of the first college hall.
The University also uses a stylized "A" as a logo for its sports teams.

Residences.
Approximately 1500 students live on-campus in 12 residences:  Arthur Eddington  Sir  <START:person> Arthur Stanley Eddington <END> , OM, FRS (28 December 1882 – 22 November 1944) was a British astronomer, physicist, and mathematician of the early 20th century who did his greatest work in astrophysics.
He was also a philosopher of science and a popularizer of science.
The Eddington limit, the natural limit to the luminosity of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour.
He is famous for his work regarding the theory of relativity.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrote a number of articles that announced and explained  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's theory of general relativity to the English-speaking world.
World War I severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England.
He also conducted an expedition to observe the Solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 that provided one of the earliest confirmations of relativity, and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.
Early years.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was born 28 December 1882 in Kendal,  <START:person> Westmorland <END>  (now Cumbria), England, the son of Quaker parents,  <START:person> Arthur Henry Eddington <END>  and  <START:person> Sarah Ann Shout <END> .
His father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to  <START:person> Kendal <END>  to become headmaster of Stramongate School.
He died in the typhoid epidemic which swept England in 1884.
His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income.
The family moved to Weston-super-Mare where at first  <START:person> Stanley <END>  (as his mother and sister always called  <START:person> Eddington <END> ) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.
In 1893  <START:person> Eddington <END>  entered Brynmelyn School.
He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature.
His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the University of Manchester) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year.
He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to physics for the next three years.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers,  <START:person> Arthur Schuster <END>  and  <START:person> Horace Lamb <END> .
At Manchester,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician  <START:person> J. W. Graham <END> .
His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a B.Sc. in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.
Based on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge in 1902.
His tutor at Cambridge was  <START:person> Robert Alfred Herman <END>  and in 1904  <START:person> Eddington <END>  became the first ever second-year student to be placed as Senior Wrangler.
After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on thermionic emission in the Cavendish Laboratory.
This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students.
This hiatus was brief.
Death.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  died of cancer in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 22 November 1944.
His body was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium (Cambridgeshire) on 27 November 1944; the cremated remains were buried in the grave of his mother in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.
Astronomy.
In January 1906,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the Astronomer Royal at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.
He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month.
He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the parallax of 433 Eros on photographic plates that had started in 1900.
He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the  <START:person> Smith <END> 's Prize in 1907.
The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge.
In December 1912  <START:person> George Darwin <END> , son of  <START:person> Charles Darwin <END> , died suddenly and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was promoted to his chair as the Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in early 1913.
Later that year,  <START:person> Robert Ball <END> , holder of the theoretical  <START:person> Lowndean <END>  chair also died, and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was named the director of the entire Cambridge Observatory the next year.
In May 1914 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and won their Royal Medal in 1918 and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1926.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  also investigated the interior of stars through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes.
He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for Cepheid variables.
He began by extending  <START:person> Karl Schwarzschild <END> 's earlier work on radiation pressure in Emden polytropic models.
These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere.
He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior.
However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, density and pressure at all points inside a star, and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics.
 <START:person> James Jeans <END>  contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be ionized, but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important mass-luminosity relation.
This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as ideal gases.
In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy.
Jeans and others defended the  <START:person> Kelvin <END> – <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  mechanism, which was based on classical mechanics, while  <START:person> Eddington <END>  speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.
With these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees.
In 1924, he discovered the mass-luminosity relation for stars (see Lecchini in #External links and references ).
Despite some disagreement,  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution.
The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by  <START:person> Michelson <END>  in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's intuitive, exploratory style.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as "The Internal Constitution of the Stars", which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and  <START:person> Edward Arthur Milne <END> .
An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in quantum physics, including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.
Dispute with  <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END>  on existence of black holes.
The topic of extension of his models precipitated his famous dispute with  <START:person> Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar <END> , who was then a student at Cambridge.
 <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's work presaged the discovery of black holes, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  refused to believe that  <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world.
History clearly proved  <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrong, but his motivation remains a matter of some controversy.
 <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays  <START:person> Eddington <END>  as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist.
This is at variance with  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's character as described by other contemporaries.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain away the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.
Relativity.
During World War I,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from  <START:person> Willem de Sitter <END>  regarding  <START:person> Einstein <END> ’s theory of general relativity.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his Quaker religious beliefs, one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist.
He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain.
He and Astronomer Royal  <START:person> Frank Watson Dyson <END>  organized two expeditions to observe a solar eclipse in 1919 to make the first empirical test of  <START:person> Einstein <END> ’s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field.
In fact,  <START:person> Dyson <END> ’s argument for the indispensability of  <START:person> Eddington <END> ’s expertise in this test was what prevented  <START:person> Eddington <END>  from eventually having to enter military service.
When conscription was introduced in Britain on 2 March 1916,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  intended to apply for an exemption as a conscientious objector.
Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's work being of national interest.
In 1918, this was appealed against by the Ministry of National Service.
Before the appeal tribunal in June,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognised and would have ended his exemption in August 1918.
A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record.
Astronomer Royal, Sir  <START:person> Frank Dyson <END> , supported  <START:person> Eddington <END>  at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's essential role in the solar eclipse expedition to Principe in May 1919.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  made clear his willingness to serve in the Friends' Ambulance Unit, the Red Cross, or as a harvest labourer.
However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of  <START:person> Eddington <END>  continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Principe expedition.
The war ended before the end of his exemption.
After the war,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  travelled to the island of Príncipe near Africa to watch the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919.
During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars in the region around the Sun.
According to the theory of general relativity, stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field.
This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by  <START:person> Einstein <END> .
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's observations published the next year confirmed  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's theory, and were hailed at the time as a conclusive proof of general relativity over the Newtonian model.
The news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story.
Afterward,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations.
It has been claimed that  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's observations were of poor quality, and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at Sobral, Brazil, which appeared closer to the Newtonian model, but a 1979 re-analysis with modern measuring equipment and contemporary software validated  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's results and conclusions.
The quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations, but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers.
The rejection of the results from the Brazil expedition was due to a defect in the telescopes used which, again, was completely accepted and well-understood by contemporary astronomers.
Throughout this period,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific.
He collected many of these into the "Mathematical Theory of Relativity" in 1923, which  <START:person> Albert Einstein <END>  suggested was "the finest presentation of the subject in any language."
He was an early advocate of  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment:  <START:person> Ludwik Silberstein <END> , a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached  <START:person> Eddington <END>  at the Royal Society's (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged  <START:person> Arthur <END>  as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory ( <START:person> Silberstein <END> , of course, was including himself and  <START:person> Einstein <END>  as the other two).
When  <START:person> Eddington <END>  refrained from replying, he insisted  <START:person> Arthur <END>  not be "so shy", whereupon  <START:person> Eddington <END>  replied, "Oh, no!
I was wondering who the third one might be!" Cosmology.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models.
He had been investigating the instability of the  <START:person> Einstein <END>  universe when he learned of both  <START:person> Lemaître <END> 's 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession on the spiral nebulae.
He felt the cosmological constant must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics.
In "The Mathematical Theory of Relativity,"  <START:person> Eddington <END>  interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is "self-gauging".
Fundamental theory and the  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number.
During the 1920s until his death, he increasingly concentrated on what he called "fundamental theory" which was intended to be a unification of quantum theory, relativity, cosmology, and gravitation.
At first he progressed along "traditional" lines, but turned increasingly to an almost numerological analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.
His basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number.
In many cases these would result in numbers close to 1040, its square, or its square root.
He was convinced that the mass of the proton and the charge of the electron were a "natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe" and that their values were not accidental.
One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics,  <START:person> Paul Dirac <END> , also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the  <START:person> Dirac <END>  large numbers hypothesis, and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.
A somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the fine structure constant, α.
At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons.
Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the degrees of freedom, so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number.
Wags at the time started calling him "Arthur Adding-one".
This change of stance detracted from  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's credibility in the physics community.
The is estimated at 1/137.035 999 074(44).
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed "E-numbers" (representing a certain group – a  <START:person> Clifford <END>  algebra).
These in effect incorporated spacetime into a higher-dimensional structure.
While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a grand unified theory.
Moreover,  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics.
In particular, he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the Universe 136 x 2256, or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons + electrons.
When equalized with the non-dark energy equivalent number of hydrogen atoms (3/10) x Rc2/GmH, this corresponds to a Universe radius R = 13.8
Giga light year, a value predicted for years from universal constants using an atomic-cosmic symmetry, and compatible with c-times the so-called Universe age 13.80(4) Gyr, as determined by the recent mission Planck (March 2003).
He did not complete this line of research before his death in 1944; his book "Fundamental Theory" was published posthumously in 1948.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  number for cycling.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  is credited with devising a measure of a cyclist's long-distance riding achievements.
The  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days.
For example an  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions.
Achieving a high  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's own E-number was 84.
The  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number for cycling is analogous to the "h"-index that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.
Philosophy.
Idealism.
Sir  <START:person> Arthur Eddington <END>  wrote in his book "The Nature of the Physical World" that "The stuff of the world is mind-stuff."
The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds...
The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it...
It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature...
It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character.
But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference." <START:person> —Eddington <END> ,
"The Nature of the Physical World", 276-81.
The idealist conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.
The first derives directly from current physical theory.
Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behavior of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics.
From this,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required.
The second, and more interesting argument, was based on  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts.
First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness.
We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is "mind-stuff."
Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.
But, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material.
To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world.
However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties.
But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.
 <START:person> Ian Barbour <END> , in his book Issues in Science and Religion (1966), p. 133, cites  <START:person> Arthur Eddington <END> 's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) for a text that argues The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for "the defense of the idea of human freedom" and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical idealism "the thesis that reality is basically mental".
 <START:person> Charles De Koninck <END>  points out that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase "mind-stuff" to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same "stuff" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.
As  <START:person> De Koninck <END>  quotes  <START:person> Eddington <END> , There is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it.
I will not discuss the doctrine since I have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection.
At any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon.
In the scientific world (which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing) there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer; it reflects sunlight when no one sees it; it has mass when no one is measuring the mass; it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance; and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date. <START:person> —Eddington <END> ,
"The Nature of the Physical World", 226 Indeterminism.
Against  <START:person> Albert Einstein <END>  and others who advocated determinism, indeterminism—championed by  <START:person> Eddington <END> —says that a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the epistemological limitations of physicists' understanding.
The uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, then, would not necessarily be due to hidden variables but to an indeterminism in nature itself.
Popular and philosophical writings.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrote a clever parody of "The Rubaiyat of  <START:person> Omar Khayyam <END> ", recounting his 1919 solar eclipse experiment.
It contained the following quatrain:  <poem> Oh leave the Wise our measures to collate  One thing at least is certain, LIGHT has WEIGHT, One thing is certain, and the rest debate — Light-rays, when near the Sun, DO NOT GO STRAIGHT.</poem>
During the 1920s and 30s,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  gave innumerable lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity, in addition to his textbook "The Mathematical Theory of Relativity", and later, quantum mechanics.
Many of these were gathered into books, including "The Nature of the Physical World" and "New Pathways in Science".
His skillful use of literary allusions and humor helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of  <START:person> Eddington <END> ’s clear and entertaining exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics.
He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum physics) provided new room for personal religious experience and free will.
Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.
He is sometimes misunderstood as having promoted the infinite monkey theorem in his 1928 book "The Nature of the Physical World", with the phrase "If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the British Museum".
It is clear from the context that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration.
On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term "improbable" is functionally equivalent to "impossible".
His popular writings made him, quite literally, a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.
Adrenal gland  The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a wide variety of hormones.
They are found on the top of the kidneys and consist of a number of different layers that directly influence the structure and function of the glands.
Each gland has an outer cortex made of steroid-producing cells surrounding a core of medulla, formed by chromaffin cells in direct relationship with the sympathetic nervous system.
The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones according to their functions and microscopic appearance.
The adrenal cortex produces a class of steroid hormones, the corticosteroids, which are classified according to their effects.
Mineralocorticoids, produced in the zona glomerulosa, help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance.
Glucocorticoids such as cortisol, are synthesized in the zona fasciculata and their functions include regulation of glycogen and lipid metabolism and immune system suppression.
The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis produces androgens (steroid hormones) that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs.
The production of steroid hormones is named steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells.
The medulla produces the catecholamines, epinephrine, and norepinephrine which function to provoke a quick response on diverse organs in stress situations.
Regulation of synthesis and secretion of adrenal hormones is equally varied.
Mineralocorticoid production is mainly under influence of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, in which specialized juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys monitor blood volume and start a cascade of reactions that leads to the stimulation of aldosterone synthesis in the zona glomerulosa.
Cortisol and androgen synthesis are under control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a classic example of a negative feedback loop, in which the hypothalamus and pituitary gland release stimulating hormones whenever cortisol levels are low.
In contrast, release of medullary catecholamines is regulated by direct innervation from the sympathetic nervous system.
There are a number of endocrine diseases and disorders that can affect the normal functioning of the adrenal gland.
Overproduction of corticosteroid hormones leads to  <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome, whereas insufficiency is commonly associated with  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by a disregulation of endocrine control mechanisms.
A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue, and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.
Structure.
The adrenal glands are located bilaterally in the retroperitoneum superior and slightly medial to the kidneys.
In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left adrenal gland is semilunar in shape; in non-humans, they are quadrilateral in shape.
The combined weight of the adrenal glands in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10 grams.
The adrenal glands are surrounded by an adipose capsule and are enclosed within the renal fascia, a fibrous structure that also surrounds the kidney.
A weak septum of connective tissue separates the glands from the kidneys and facilitates surgical removal of the kidneys without damage to the glands.
The adrenal glands are in close relationship with the diaphragm, and are attached to the crura of the diaphragm by means of the renal fascia.
Each adrenal gland has two anatomically and functionally distinct parts, the outer adrenal cortex and the inner medulla, both of which produce hormones.
The cortex mainly produces aldosterone, cortisol and androgens, while the medulla produces adrenaline and noradrenaline.
Cortex.
The adrenal cortex is devoted to production of corticosteroid and androgen hormones.
Specific cortical cells produce particular hormones including aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens such as androstenedione.
Under normal unstressed conditions, the human adrenal glands produce the equivalent of 35–40 mg of cortisone acetate per day.
The adrenal cortex comprises three zones, or layers.
This "anatomic zonation" can be appreciated at the microscopic level, where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics.
The adrenal cortex exhibits "functional zonation" as well: by virtue of the characteristic enzymes present in each zone, the zones produce and secrete distinct hormones.
Zona glomerulosa.
The outermost layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona glomerulosa, lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland.
Cells in this layer form ovoid groups, separated by trabeculae of connective tissue that are continuous with the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.
This layer is the main site for production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, by the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase.
Aldosterone is a hormone largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure.
The expression of neuron-specific proteins in the zona glomerulosa cells of human adrenocortical tissues has been predicted and reported by several authors and it was suggested that the expression of proteins like the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the cells of the zona glomerulosa reflects the regenerative feature of these cells, which would lose NCAM immunoreactivity after moving to the zona fasciculata.
However, together with other data on neuroendocrine properties of zona glomerulosa cells, NCAM expression may reflect a neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells.
Voltage-dependent calcium channels have been detected in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, which suggests that calcium-channel blockers may directly influence the adrenocortical biosynthesis of aldosterone in vivo.
Zona fasciculata.
Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the zona fasciculata is responsible for producing mainly glucocorticoids such as cortisol.
It is the widest of the three layers as it composes nearly 80% of the cortical volume.
The cells, arranged in columns radially oriented towards the medulla, have numerous lipid droplets responsible of the pale staining nature of the cytoplasm.
Abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum are also present in the cells of this layer.
Zona reticularis.
The innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly next to the medulla.
It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans.
Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue.
The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.
Medulla.
The adrenal medulla is the core of the adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex.
The chromaffin cells of the medulla (named for their characteristic brown staining with chromic acid salts) are the body's main source of the circulating catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla.
Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted.
To carry out its part of this response, the adrenal medulla receives input from the sympathetic nervous system through preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord from T5–T11.
Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion.
Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.
Blood supply.
Although variations of the blood supply to the adrenal glands (and kidneys) are common, there are usually three arteries that supply each adrenal gland: Venous drainage of the adrenal glands is achieved via the suprarenal veins: The central adrenomedullary vein is a particular type of blood vessel in the adrenal medulla.
Its structure is different from the other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.
The suprarenal vein exits the adrenal gland through a depression on its anterior surface known as the hilum.
Note that the arteries supplying the suprarenal gland do not pass through the hilum.
The suprarenal veins may form anastomoses with the inferior phrenic veins.
Since the right supra-renal vein is short and drains directly into the inferior vena cava it is likely to injure the latter during removal of right adrenal for various reasons.
The adrenal glands (alongside the thyroid gland) have one of the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue of any organ.
Up to 60 arterioles may enter each adrenal gland.
This may be one of the reasons that lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the adrenals.
Function.
The adrenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other parts of the body.
These hormones are involved in a number of different pathways.
Corticosteroid production.
All corticosteroid hormones share cholesterol as a common precursor.
In consequence, the first step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis.
Cells that produce steroid hormones provide themselves with cholesterol in various ways.
Their main source is dietary cholesterol transported in the blood as LDL, which enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, although endogenous synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum is sufficient when LDL levels are abnormally low as represented in people with abetalipoproteinemia (a genetic disorder of intestinal lipid absorption).
In lysosomes, cholesterol is separated from the proteic component of LDL and then stored within cell membranes or bound with proteins.
The initial part of conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones involves a number of enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that are located in the inner membrane of mitochondria.
Transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane is facilitated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and is the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis.
The functional zonation of the adrenal cortex is determined by the presence of distinct enzymes in each particular layer, explaining how the different layers produce unique hormones from a common precursor.
The first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase.
After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it.
Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs).
Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones.
Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases.
For example, the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.
Regulation of corticosteroid production.
Glucocorticoids are under the regulatory influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone of the anterior pituitary.
In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated by the presence of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus.
ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes.
The HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis.
The HPA-axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.
Mineralocorticoid secretion is regulated mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), the concentration of potassium, and ACTH to a lesser extent.
Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II.
Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.
Catecholamine production.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines, water-soluble compounds that have a structure made of a catechol group and an amino group.
The adrenal glands are responsible for the majority of circulating epinephrine (adrenaline) in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating norepinephrine (noradrenaline).
These hormones are released in the adrenal medulla, which is richly vascular.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.
Catecholamines are produced in chromaffin cells (the main type of cells in the adrenal medulla) from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver.
The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in the first step of catecholamine synthesis.
L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into norepinephrine.
In the cytosol, norepinephrine is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules.
Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.
The adrenal medulla is innervated by splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system, which signal the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.
Effects of adrenal hormones.
Mineralocorticoids.
Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid produced in the body.
Its effects are on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct).
Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates.
Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation.
Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium (Ca2+) entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry.
However, mouse zona glomerulosa cells within adrenal slices spontaneously generate membrane potential oscillations of low periodicity; this innate electrical excitability of zona glomerulosa cells provides a platform for the production of a recurrent Ca2+ channels signal that can be controlled by angiotensin II and extracellular potassium, the two major regulators of aldosterone production.[30]
Angiotensin II originates from plasmatic angiotensin I after the conversion of angiotensinogen by renin produced by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney.[
Glucocorticoids.
Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid produced under normal conditions and its actions include mobilization of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, but it does not increase under starvation conditions.
Additionally, cortisol enhances the activity of other hormones including glucagon and catecholamines.
The zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary.
Adrenal androgens.
Cells in zona reticularis of the adrenal glands produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most important of which is DHEA.
In general, these hormones do not have an overall effect in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines that act at adrenergic receptors throughout the body, with effects including constriction of small arteries, dilation of veins, and an increase in the heartrate.
Adrenergic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors.
This means that they interact with G proteins, a family of enzymes that start a chain of reactions leading to the formation of intracellular second messengers.
There are many classes of adrenergic receptors, and the specific response in the cell upon binding of either epinephrine or norepinephrine depends on the mechanism of action of those receptors.
For example, when epinephrine or norepinephrine bind to β-adrenergic receptors, the level of cAMP (a second messenger) rises inside the cell, but if they bind to α2-adrenergic receptors in other tissues, the level of cAMP lowers.
Development.
The adrenal glands are composed of two heterogenous types of tissue: in the center there is the adrenal medulla, which produces and releases mostly adrenaline to the blood in stress situations as part of the sympathetic nervous system.
Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a wide variety of steroid hormones.
These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal developments.
Cortex.
Adrenal cortex tissue is derived from the intermediate mesoderm.
It first appears 33 days after fertilisation, shows steroidogenic (steroid hormone production) capabilities by the eighth week and undergoes rapid growth during the first trimester of pregnancy.
The fetal adrenal cortex is different from its adult counterpart, as it is composed of two distinct zones: the inner fetal zone, which carries most of the hormone-producing activity, and the outer definitive zone, which is in a proliferative phase.
The fetal zone produces large amounts of adrenal androgens (male sex hormones) that are used by the placenta for estrogen biosynthesis.
Cortical development of the adrenal gland is regulated mostly by ACTH, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates cortisol synthesis.
During midgestation, the fetal zone occupies most of the cortical volume and produces 100–200 mg/day of DHEA-S, an androgen and precursor of both androgens and estrogens (female sex hormones).
Adrenal hormones, especially glucocorticoids such as cortisol are considered essential for prenatal development of organs, particularly for the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The adrenal gland decreases in size after birth because of the rapid disappearance of the fetal zone, with a decrease in androgen secretion.
Adrenarche.
During childhood, androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but several years before puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of DHEA and DHEA-S.
These changes are part of a process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates.
Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex.
Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.
Medulla.
The adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which come from the ectoderm layer of the embryo.
These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs.
These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system.
Cells of the adrenal medulla are also called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs.
Glucocorticoid production by the adrenal cortex was thought to be responsible for this differentiation, but now the available data suggest that BMP-4 secreted in the adrenal tissue is the primary responsible for the differentiation, and that glucocorticoids have a role in the posterior development of the cells.
Clinical significance.
Corticosteroid overproduction.
 <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome.
 <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome is the manifestation of glucocorticoid excess.
It can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol.
Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent.
The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH.
The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.
Primary aldosteronism.
When the zona glomerulosa produces excess aldosterone, the result is primary aldosteronism.
Causes for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia of the glands and aldosterone-producing adenomas, which is called Conn's syndrome.
Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, increasing potassium depletion and sodium retention.
Adrenal insufficiency.
 <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
 <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease refers to primary hypoadrenalism, which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid production.
In the Western world,  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease is more commonly autoimmune, where the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex.
Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis.
A distinctive feature of  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.
An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and an array of nonspecific symptoms such as vomiting and fever.
An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma.
Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency.
Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when a part of the body is affected by a condition that impairs the production of hormones in the adrenal cortex.
The most common cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is a pituitary adenoma, which may affect the ability of the pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
This hormone is vital in the event of physiological stress, as it stimulates the adrenal glands into action: if absent, this action will not occur and an Addisonian crisis may follow unless an emergency hydrocortisone injection is given.
Tertiary adrenal insufficiency results from a deficiency in the production of CRH (produced by the hypothalamus).
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a congenital disease in which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis.
In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis.
As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other corticosteroids instead.
The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens.
Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.
Adrenal tumors.
Adrenal tumors are commonly found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging.
They are seen in around 3.4% of CT scans, and in most cases they are benign adenomas.
Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.
Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that arise from chromaffin cells.
They can produce a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety and palpitations.
Common signs include hypertension and tachycardia.
Surgery, especially adrenal laparoscopy, is the most common treatment for small pheochromocytomas.
History.
 <START:person> Bartolomeo Eustachi <END> , an Italian anatomist, is credited with the first description of the adrenal glands in 1564.
One of the most recognized works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 with the publication of "On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule", by the English physician  <START:person> Thomas Addison <END> .
In his monography,  <START:person> Addison <END>  described what the French physician  <START:person> George Trousseau <END>  would later name  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations.
In 1894, English physiologists  <START:person> George Oliver <END>  and  <START:person> Edward Schafer <END>  studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects.
In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts form the adrenal cortex to treat  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
 <START:person> Edward Calvin Kendall <END> ,  <START:person> Philip Hench <END>  and  <START:person> Tadeusz Reichstein <END>  were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the isolation of cortisone from the adrenal cortex.
Etymology.
The adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys.
The term "adrenal" comes from "ad-" (Latin, "near") and "renes" (Latin, "kidney").
Similarly, "suprarenal" is derived from "supra-" (Latin, "above") and "renes".
 <START:person> Alfonso Leng  Alfonso Leng Haygus <END>  (11 February 1884 – 11 November 1974) was a post-romantic composer of classical music.
He was born in Santiago, Chile.
He wrote the first important symphonic work in Chilean tradition, "La Muerte de Alcino", a symphonic poem inspired by the novel of  <START:person> Pedro Prado <END> .
He composed many art songs in different languages and important piano pieces, like the five "Doloras" (1914), which he later orchestrated and are normally played in concerts in Chile and Latin America.
He won the Nacional Art Prize in 1957.
 <START:person> Leng <END>  was also an accomplished dentist in Santiago.
As a dentist, he was the main founder of the dentistry faculty of the Universidad de Chile, and he was eventually elected as the first dean.
 <START:person> Leng <END>  was the nephew of composer  <START:person> Carmela Mackenna <END> .
AD (disambiguation)  An ad (advertisement) is a form of marketing communication.
AD ("Anno Domini") is a designation used to label years following 1 BC in the  <START:person> Julian <END>  and Gregorian calendars.
AD, A.D. or Ad may also refer to: People.
People nicknamed "AD" or "A.D." include: "Ad" can also refer to:  Adamic language  The Adamic language is, according to Jews (as recorded in the "midrashim") and some Christians, the language spoken by  <START:person> Adam <END>  (and possibly Eve) in the Garden of Eden.
It is variously interpreted as either the language used by God to address  <START:person> Adam <END>  (the divine language), or the language invented by  <START:person> Adam <END>  with which he named all things (including Eve), as in .
Medieval.
Traditional Jewish exegesis such as Midrash ( <START:person> Genesis Rabbah <END>  38) says that  <START:person> Adam <END>  spoke Hebrew because the names he gives Eve – ""Isha" (Book of Genesis 2:23) and "Chava"" (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew.
By contrast,  <START:person> Kabbalism <END>  assumed an "eternal Torah" which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew.
Thus,  <START:person> Abulafia <END>  in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in Paradise had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.
Eco (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of  <START:person> Adam <END>  was preserved by  <START:person> Adam <END> 's descendants until the confusion of tongues (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).
 <START:person> Dante <END>  addresses the topic in his "De Vulgari Eloquentia".
He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.
He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to  <START:person> Eve <END> , addressing the serpent, and not to  <START:person> Adam <END> .
In his "Divina Commedia", however,  <START:person> Dante <END>  changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise.
 <START:person> Dante <END>  concludes ("Paradiso" XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, "El", must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which  <START:person> Dante <END>  gives as "I".
Early Modern.
Elizabethan scholar  <START:person> John Dee <END>  makes references to an occult or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of spirit medium  <START:person> Edward Kelley <END> .
 <START:person> Dee <END> 's journals did not describe the language as "Enochian", instead preferring "Angelical", the "Celestial Speech", the "Language of Angels", the "First Language of God-Christ", the "Holy Language", or "Adamical" because, according to  <START:person> Dee <END> 's Angels, it was used by  <START:person> Adam <END>  in Paradise to name all things.
The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to  <START:person> Dee <END> 's assertion that the Biblical Patriarch  <START:person> Enoch <END>  had been the last human (before  <START:person> Dee <END>  and  <START:person> Kelley <END> ) to know the language.
Modern.
Latter Day Saint movement.
 <START:person> Joseph Smith <END> , founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, in his revision of the Bible, declared the Adamic language to have been "pure and undefiled".
Some Latter Day Saints believe it to be the language of God.
Glossolalia, or speaking in tongues, was commonplace in the early years of the LDS Church, and it was commonly believed that the incomprehensible language spoken during these incidents was the language of  <START:person> Adam <END>  though this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted.
Some other early Latter Day Saint leaders, including Brigham Young,  <START:person> Orson Pratt <END> , and  <START:person> Elizabeth Ann Whitney <END> , claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language by revelation.
Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the "pure language" spoken of by  <START:person> Zephaniah <END>  and that it will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world.
Apostle  <START:person> Orson Pratt <END>  declared that "Ahman", part of the name of the settlement "Adam-ondi-Ahman" in Daviess County, Missouri, was the name of God in the Adamic language.
An 1832 handwritten page from the  <START:person> Joseph Smith <END>  Papers, titled "A Sample of the Pure Language", and reportedly dictated by  <START:person> Smith <END>  to "Br.
 <START:person> Johnson <END> ", asserts that the name of God is "Awmen".
The Latter Day Saint endowment prayer circle once included use of the words "Pay Lay Ale".
These untranslated words are no longer used in temple ordinances and have been replaced by an English version, "O God, hear the words of my mouth".
Some believe that the "Pay Lay Ale" sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase "pe le-El", פה לאל "mouth to God".
Other words thought by some Latter Day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include "deseret" ("honey bee"), see Ether and "Ahman" ("God") see Doctrine and Covenants  The Book of Moses refers to "a book of remembrance" written in the language of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
 <START:person> Avery Hopwood  James Avery Hopwood <END>  (May 28, 1882 July 1, 1928), was an American playwright, called the most successful playwright of the Jazz Age, having four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920.
Biography.
He was born in Cleveland, Ohio and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Michigan (1905).
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, "Clothes" (1906), produced on Broadway.
He became known as "The Playboy Playwright" and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué at the time.
One play, "The Demi-Virgin" in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, "Stripping Cupid", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie.
The case was dismissed.
Dramatist.
His many plays included "Nobody's Widow" (1910), starring  <START:person> Blanche Bates <END> ; "Fair and Warmer" (1915), starring  <START:person> Madge Kennedy <END>  (filmed in 1919); "The Gold Diggers" (1919), starring  <START:person> Ina Claire <END>  (filmed in 1923 as "The Gold Diggers", in 1928 as "Gold Diggers of Broadway" and also as "Gold Diggers of 1933"); "Ladies' Night", 1920, starring  <START:person> Charlie Ruggles <END>  (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play "The Bat" (with  <START:person> Mary Roberts Rinehart <END> ), 1920 (filmed in 1926 "The Bat", 1930 "The Bat Whispers," and 1959 "The Bat)"; "Getting  <START:person> Gertie <END> 's Garter" (with  <START:person> Wilson Collison <END> ), 1921, starring  <START:person> Hazel Dawn <END>  (filmed in 1927 and 1945); "The Demi-Virgin", 1921, also starring  <START:person> Dawn <END> ; "The Alarm Clock", 1923; "The Best People" (with  <START:person> David Gray <END> ), 1924 (filmed in 1925 and as "Fast and Loose" in 1930), the song-farce "Naughty Cinderella", 1925, starring  <START:person> Irene Bordoni <END>  and "The Garden of Eden" in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as "The Garden of Eden").
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  was asked to write the third act of  <START:person> Mary Roberts Rinehart <END> 's play; "The Bat".
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  collaborated with  <START:person> Rinehart <END>  to then work on the last act of the play in Sewickley and sometimes in New York.
Interestingly, the early sound film, "The Bat Whispers", played an influence on  <START:person> Bob Kane <END> 's  <START:person> Batman <END>  because the inspiration for  <START:person> Batman <END> 's costume came from the "mysterious Bat" character portrayed in the movie from 1930.
A clever, adroit, masterful craftsman who wrote to the tastes of his public,  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  was inexhaustible in his work ethic.
Although the press reported that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer  <START:person> Rose Rolanda <END>  in 1924,  <START:person> Hopwood <END> 's close friend  <START:person> Carl Van Vechten <END>  confirmed in later years that it was all a publicity stunt.
 <START:person> Rolanda <END>  would later marry caricaturist  <START:person> Miguel Covarrubias <END> .
Death.
While swimming at Juan-les-Pins on the French Riviera, July 1, 1928, he suffered a heart attack and died.
He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio, next to his mother,  <START:person> Jule <END> .
Hopwood Awards.
The terms of  <START:person> Hopwood <END> 's will left a substantial portion of his estate to his alma mater, the University of Michigan for the establishment of the  <START:person> Avery Hopwood <END>  and Jule Hopwood Creative Writing Awards.
The bequest stipulated: "It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged."
Famous  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  award winners include  <START:person> Robert Hayden <END> ,  <START:person> Marge Piercy <END> ,  <START:person> Arthur Miller <END> ,  <START:person> Betty Smith <END> ,  <START:person> Lawrence Kasdan <END> ,  <START:person> John Ciardi <END> ,  <START:person> Mary Gaitskill <END> ,  <START:person> Edmund White <END> ,  <START:person> Nancy Willard <END> ,  <START:person> Frank O’Hara <END> , and  <START:person> Steve Hamilton <END> .
Works.
"The Great Bordello".
Throughout his life,  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  worked on a novel that he hoped would "expose" the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published.
 <START:person> Jack Sharrar <END>  recovered the manuscript for this novel in 1982 during his research for " <START:person> Avery Hopwood <END> , His Life and Plays".
The novel was published in July 2011 as "The Great Bordello".
Adventism  Adventism is a branch of Protestantism which began in the 19th century in the context of the Second Great Awakening revival in the United States.
The name refers to belief in the imminent Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END> .
 <START:person> William Miller <END>  started the Adventist movement in the 1830s.
His followers became known as Millerites.
Although the Adventist churches hold much in common, their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of refers to the one in heaven or one on earth.
The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible, leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath.
The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs (1980 and 2005), which use Biblical references as justification.
In 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches.
The largest church within the movement — the Seventh-day Adventist Church — has more than 18 million members.
History.
Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement.
Its most vocal leader was  <START:person> William Miller <END> .
Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported  <START:person> Miller <END> 's predictions of  <START:person> Christ <END> 's return.
After the "Great Disappointment" of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.
Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (second coming of  <START:person> Jesus <END> ).
Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that  <START:person> Jesus <END>  had come not literally but "spiritually", and consequently were known as "spiritualizers".
A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted.
This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.
Albany Conference (1845).
The Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement.
Following this meeting, the "Millerites" then became known as "Adventists" or "Second Adventists".
However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.
Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the Advent Christian Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
The largest group was organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church.
Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death.
They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies.
It has diminished to almost non-existence today.
Their main publication was the "Advent Herald", of which  <START:person> Sylvester Bliss <END>  was the editor until his death in 1863.
It was later called the "Messiah’s Herald".
The Life and Advent Union was founded by  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  in 1863.
He had established "The Bible Examiner" in 1842.
It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964.
The Advent Christian Church officially formed in 1861, and grew rapidly at first.
It declined a little during the 20th century.
The Advent Christians publish the four magazines "The Advent Christian Witness", "Advent Christian News", "Advent Christian Missions" and "Maranatha".
They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a one-year Bible College in Lenox, Massachusetts called Berkshire Institute for Christian Studies.
The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church officially formed in 1863.
It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.
It published the "Adventist Review, Kids Review, and Sabbath Herald".
It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.
 <START:person> Miller <END>  did not join any of the movements, and he spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.
Denominations.
The "Handbook of Denominations in the United States", 12th edn., describes the following churches as "Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches": Christadelphians.
The Christadelphians were founded in 1844 by  <START:person> John Thomas <END>  and had an estimated 25,000 members in 170 ecclesias, or churches, in 2000 in America.
Advent Christian Church.
The Advent Christian Church was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America.
It is a "first-day" body of Adventist Christians founded on the teachings of  <START:person> William Miller <END> .
It adopted the "conditional immortality" views of  <START:person> Charles F. Hudson <END>  and  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  who formed the "Advent Christian Association" in Salem, Massachusetts in 1860.
Primitive Advent Christian Church.
The Primitive Advent Christian Church is a small group which separated from the Advent Christian Church.
It differs from the parent body mainly on two points.
Its members observe foot washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized).
This is sometimes referred to as rebaptism.
Seventh-day Adventist.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, founded in 1863, had over 17,210,000 baptized members (not counting children of members) worldwide as of 2011.
It is best known for its teaching that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the Sabbath and is the appropriate day for worship.
However, it is the second coming of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  along with the Judgement day, based on the three angels message in Revelation 14: 6-13, that is the main doctrine of SDA.
Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement.
The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members from the Seventh-day Adventist Church caused by disagreement over military service on the Sabbath day during World War I. Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association.
The Davidians (originally named  <START:person> Shepherd <END> 's Rod) is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members made up primarily of voluntarily disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
They were originally known as the Shepherd's Rod and are still sometimes referred to as such.
The group derives its name from two books on Bible doctrine written by its founder,  <START:person> Victor Houteff <END> , in 1929.
Branch Davidians.
The Branch Davidians were a split ("branch") from the Davidians.
Many of them were killed during the infamous Waco Siege of April 1993.
Church of God (Seventh Day).
The Church of God (Seventh-Day) was founded in 1863 and it had an estimated 11,000 members in 185 churches in 1999 in America.
Its founding members separated in 1858 from those Adventists associated with  <START:person> Ellen G. White <END>  who later organized themselves as Seventh-day Adventists in 1863.
The Church of God (Seventh Day) split in 1933, creating two bodies: one headquartered in Salem, West Virginia, and known as the Church of God (7th day) Salem Conference and the other one headquartered in Denver, Colorado and known as the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day).
The Worldwide Church of God splintered from this.
Church of God and Saints of  <START:person> Christ <END> .
The Church of God and Saints of  <START:person> Christ <END>  was founded in 1896 and had an estimated 40,000 members in approximately 200 congregations in 1999 in America.
Church of God General Conference.
Many denominations known as "Church of God" have Adventist origins.
The Church of God General Conference was founded in 1921 and had 7,634 members in 162 churches in 2004 in America.
It is an Adventist Christian body which is also known as the "Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith" and the "Church of God General Conference ( <START:person> Morrow <END> , GA)".
Creation Seventh-Day Adventist.
Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church United Seventh-Day Brethren.
The United Seventh-Day Brethren is a small Sabbatarian Adventist body.
In 1947, several individuals and two independent congregations within the Church of God Adventist movement formed the "United Seventh-Day Brethren", seeking to increase fellowship and to combine their efforts in evangelism, publications, and other .
Other relationships.
The Bible Students movement founded by  <START:person> Charles Taze Russell <END>  had in its early development close connections with the Millerite movement and stalwarts of the Adventist faith, including  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  and  <START:person> Joseph Seiss <END> .
The various groupings of Bible Students currently have a cumulative membership of less than 20,000 worldwide.
Although  <START:person> Jehovah <END> 's Witnesses and Bible Students do not categorize themselves as part of the Millerite Adventist movement (or other denominations, in general), some theologians do categorize the group and schisms as Millerite Adventist because of its teachings regarding an imminent Second Coming and use of specific dates.
As of January 2014 there are approximately 8 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.
High Sabbath Adventists are a group of Seventh-day Adventists who believe in the prophetic significance of the High Sabbaths.
They are Historic Adventists who believe that God has been giving the light of the fourth angel (of Revelation 18) in the form of the Orion Message since 2010.

General:  American Football League  The American Football League (AFL) was a major professional American football league that operated from 1960 until 1969, when it merged with the National Football League (NFL).
The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence.
The AFL was created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises.
The AFL's original lineup saw an Eastern division of the New York Titans, Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers along with a Western division of the Los Angeles Chargers, Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders, and Dallas Texans.
The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960, including Houston's successful signing of All-American  <START:person> Billy Cannon <END> .
While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance, the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with ABC (followed by a contract with NBC for games starting with the 1965 season) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide.
Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, as well as successful franchise shifts to San Diego (from LA) and Kansas City (from Dallas), the AFL established a dedicated following.
The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league's reputation among the major media.
As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues, especially after a series of "raids," the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966.
Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions, which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl.
The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game.
During this time the AFL added the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals.
After losses by Kansas City and Oakland in the first two AFL-NFL Championship Games to the Green Bay Packers, the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowls III and IV, cementing the league's claim to being an equal to the NFL.
In 1970, the AFL was absorbed into the NFL, and the ten AFL franchises along with the Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers became the American Football Conference.
League history.
During the 1950s, the National Football League had grown to rival Major League Baseball as one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States.
One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the Chicago Cardinals, owned by the  <START:person> Bidwill <END>  family, who had become overshadowed by the more popular Chicago Bears.
The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to St. Louis but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee.
Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END> , son and heir of Texas millionaire oilman  <START:person> H. L. Hunt <END> .
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to Dallas, Texas, where he had grown up.
However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a previous NFL franchise had failed in 1952.
While Hunt negotiated with Bidwills, similar offers were made by  <START:person> Bud Adams <END> ,  <START:person> Bob Howsam <END> , and  <START:person> Max Winter <END> .
When  <START:person> Hunt <END> ,  <START:person> Adams <END> , and  <START:person> Howsam <END>  were unable to secure a controlling interest in the Chicago Cardinals, they approached NFL commissioner  <START:person> Bert Bell <END>  and proposed the addition of expansion teams.
Bell, wary of expanding the 12-team league and risking its newfound success, rejected the offer.
On his return flight to Dallas,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  conceived the idea of an entirely new league and decided to contact the others who had shown interest in purchasing the Cardinals.
He contacted  <START:person> Adams <END> ,  <START:person> Howsam <END> , and Winter (as well as Winter's business partner,  <START:person> Bill Boyer <END> ) to gauge their interest in starting a new league.
 <START:person> Hunt <END> 's first meeting with  <START:person> Adams <END>  was held in March 1959.
Hunt, who felt a regional rivalry would be critical for the success of the new league, convinced  <START:person> Adams <END>  to join and found his team in Houston.
Hunt next secured an agreement from  <START:person> Howsam <END>  to bring a team to Denver, Colorado.
After Winter and  <START:person> Boyer <END>  agreed to start a team in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, the new league had its first four teams.
Hunt then approached  <START:person> Willard Rhodes <END> , who hoped to bring pro football to Seattle, Washington.
However, the University of Washington was unwilling to let the fledgling league use Husky Stadium, probably due to the excessive wear and tear that would have caused to the facility's grass surface.
With no place for his team to play,  <START:person> Rhodes <END> ' effort came to nothing.
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  also sought franchises in Los Angeles, California; Buffalo and New York City.
During the summer of 1959 he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a potentially costly rivalry.
Within weeks of the July 1959 announcement of the league's formation,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  received commitments from Barron Hilton and  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END>  to bring teams to Los Angeles and New York, respectively.
His initial efforts for Buffalo, However, were rebuffed, when  <START:person> Hunt <END> 's first choice of owner,  <START:person> Pat McGroder <END> , declined to take part;  <START:person> McGroder <END>  had hoped that the threat of the AFL would be enough to prompt the NFL to expand to Buffalo.
On August 14, 1959, the first league meeting was held in Chicago, Illinois, and charter memberships were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, and  <START:person> Minneapolis-Saint Paul <END> .
On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League.
The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier All-America Football Conference (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league.
AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones.
Only the party from Minneapolis accepted, and the Minnesota group joined the NFL the next year in 1961; the Minneapolis group joined Ole Haugsrud in the new NFL team's ownership group, with Haugsrud dubbing the team the Minnesota Vikings.
The older league also announced on August 29 that it had conveniently reversed its position against expansion, and planned to bring NFL expansion teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961.
(The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team – the Dallas Cowboys – actually started play in 1960, and the  <START:person> Vikings <END>  began play in 1961.)
Finally, the NFL quickly came to terms with the Bidwills and allowed them to relocate the struggling Cardinals to St. Louis, eliminating that city as a potential AFL market.
 <START:person> Ralph Wilson <END> , who owned a minority interest in the NFL's Detroit Lions at the time, initially announced he was placing a team in Miami, Florida, but like the Seattle situation, was also rebuffed by local ownership; given five other choices,  <START:person> Wilson <END>  negotiated with  <START:person> McGroder <END>  and brought the team that would become the Bills to Buffalo.
Buffalo was officially awarded its franchise on October 28.
During a league meeting on November 22, a 10-man ownership group from Boston, Massachusetts (led by  <START:person> Billy Sullivan <END> ) was awarded the AFL's eighth team.
On November 30, 1959,  <START:person> Joe Foss <END> , a World War II Marine fighter ace and former governor of South Dakota, was named the AFL's first commissioner.
 <START:person> Foss <END>  commissioned a friend of  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END> 's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo.
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  was elected President of the AFL on January 26, 1960.
The AFL Draft.
The AFL's first draft took place the same day Boston was awarded its franchise, and lasted 33 rounds.
The league held a second draft on December 2, which lasted for 20 rounds.
Because the Raiders joined after the AFL draft, they inherited Minnesota's selections.
A special "allocation draft" was held in January 1960, to allow the Raiders to stock their team, as some of the other AFL teams had already signed some of Minneapolis' original draft choices.
Crisis and success (1960–61).
In November 1959, Minneapolis owner  <START:person> Max Winter <END>  announced his intent to leave the AFL to accept a franchise offer from the NFL.
In 1961, his team began play in the NFL as the Minnesota Vikings.
Los Angeles Chargers owner  <START:person> Barron Hilton <END>  demanded that a replacement for Minnesota be placed in California, to reduce his team's operating costs and to create a rivalry.
After a brief search, Oakland was chosen and an ownership group led by F. Wayne Valley and local real estate developer  <START:person> Chet Soda <END>  was formed.
After initially being called the Oakland "Señores", the Oakland Raiders officially joined the AFL on January 30, 1960.
The AFL's first major success came when the Houston Oilers signed  <START:person> Billy Cannon <END> , the All-American and 1959 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU.  <START:person> Cannon <END>  signed a $100,000 contract to play for the Oilers, despite having already signed a $50,000 contract with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams.
The Oilers filed suit and claimed that Rams general manager  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  had unduly manipulated Cannon.
The court upheld the Houston contract, and with Cannon the Oilers appeared in the AFL's first three championship games (winning two).
On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with ABC, which brought in revenues of approximately $2,125,000 per year for the entire league.
On June 17, the AFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, which was dismissed in 1962 after a two-month trial.
The AFL began regular-season play (a night game on Friday, September 9, 1960) with eight teams in the league — the Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Dallas Texans, Denver Broncos, Houston Oilers, Los Angeles Chargers, New York Titans, and Oakland Raiders.
Raiders' co-owner  <START:person> Wayne Valley <END>  dubbed the AFL ownership "The Foolish Club," a term  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  subsequently used on team photographs he sent as Christmas gifts.
The Oilers became the first-ever league champions by defeating the Chargers, 24–16, in the AFL Championship on January 1, 1961.
Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable for a new league, but not nearly that of the NFL.
Whereas the more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures in excess of 50,000 per game, AFL attendance generally hovered between 10,000-20,000 per game.
With the low attendance came financial losses.
The Raiders, for instance, lost $500,000 in their first year and only survived after receiving a $400,000 loan from Bills owner  <START:person> Ralph Wilson <END> .
In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation.
In fact, the only major change was the relocation of the Chargers from Los Angeles to nearby San Diego.
On August 8, 1961, the AFL challenged the Canadian Football League to an exhibition game that would feature the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the Buffalo Bills.
Playing at Civic Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario, the Ticats defeated the Bills 38–21 playing a mix of AFL and CFL rules.
Movement and instability (1962–63).
While the Oilers found instant success in the AFL, other teams did not fare as well.
The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans struggled on and off the field during their first few seasons in the league.
Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses their first season.
Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the team playing in the San Francisco Bay Area—which already had an established NFL team (the San Francisco 49ers)—but the product on the field was also to blame.
After winning six games their debut season, the Raiders won a total of three times in the 1961 and 1962 seasons.
Oakland took part in a 1961 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did little good.
They participated in another such draft in 1962.
The Titans fared a little better on the field but had their own financial troubles.
Attendance was so low for home games that team owner  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END>  had fans move to seats closer to the field to give the illusion of a fuller stadium on television.
Eventually  <START:person> Wismer <END>  could no longer afford to meet his payroll, and on November 8, 1962 the AFL took over operations of the team.
The Titans were sold to a five-person ownership group headed by  <START:person> Sonny Werblin <END>  on March 28, 1963, and in April the new owners changed the team's name to the New York Jets.
The Raiders and Titans both finished last in their respective divisions in the 1962 season.
The Texans and Oilers, winners of their divisions, faced each other for the 1962 AFL Championship on December 23.
The Texans dethroned the two-time champion Oilers, 20–17, in a double-overtime contest that was, at the time, professional football's longest-ever game.
In 1963, the Texans became the second AFL team to relocate.
 <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  felt that despite winning the league championship in 1962, the Texans could not succeed financially competing in the same market as the Dallas Cowboys, which entered the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1960.
After meetings with New Orleans, Atlanta, and Miami,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  announced on May 22 that the Texans' new home would be Kansas City, Missouri.
Kansas City mayor  <START:person> Harold Roe Bartle <END>  (nicknamed "Chief") was instrumental in his city's success in attracting the team.
Partly to honor  <START:person> Bartle <END> , the franchise officially became the Kansas City Chiefs on May 26.
The San Diego Chargers, under head coach  <START:person> Sid Gillman <END> , won a decisive 51–10 victory over the Boston Patriots for the 1963 AFL Championship.
Confident that his team was capable of beating the NFL-champion Chicago Bears (he had the Chargers' rings inscribed with the phrase "World Champions"),  <START:person> Gillman <END>  approached NFL Commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  and proposed a final championship game between the two teams.
 <START:person> Rozelle <END>  declined the offer; however, the game would be instituted three seasons later.
Watershed years (1964–65).
A series of events throughout the next few years demonstrated the AFL's ability to achieve a greater level of equality with the NFL.
On January 29, 1964, the AFL signed a lucrative $36 million television contract with NBC (beginning in the 1965 season), which gave the league money it needed to compete with the NFL for players.
An NFL owner was quoted as saying to NFL Commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  that "They don't have to call us 'Mister' anymore".
A single-game attendance record was set on November 8, 1964, when 61,929 fans packed Shea Stadium to watch the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.
The bidding war for players between the AFL and NFL escalated in 1965.
The Chiefs drafted University of Kansas star  <START:person> Gale Sayers <END>  in the first round of the 1965 AFL draft (held November 28, 1964), while the Chicago Bears did the same in the NFL draft.
 <START:person> Sayers <END>  eventually signed with the Bears.
A similar situation occurred when the New York Jets and the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals both drafted University of Alabama quarterback  <START:person> Joe Namath <END> .
In what was viewed as a key victory for the AFL,  <START:person> Namath <END>  signed a $427,000 contract with the Jets on January 2, 1965 (the deal included a new car).
It was the highest amount of money ever paid to a collegiate football player, and is cited as the strongest contributing factor to the eventual merger between the two leagues.
In early 1965, the AFL considered adding its first expansion team, to begin play in Atlanta in 1966.
An AFL franchise was awarded to  <START:person> Rankin Smith <END>  of that city.
The NFL quickly offered  <START:person> Smith <END>  a franchise, which  <START:person> Smith <END>  accepted.
In March 1965,  <START:person> Joe Robbie <END>  had met with Commissioner  <START:person> Foss <END>  to inquire about an expansion franchise for Miami, Florida.
On May 6, after Atlanta's exit,  <START:person> Robbie <END>  secured an agreement with Miami mayor  <START:person> Robert King Higho <END>  to bring a team to Miami.
League expansion was approved at a meeting held on June 7, and on August 16 the AFL's ninth franchise was officially awarded to  <START:person> Robbie <END>  and television star  <START:person> Danny Thomas <END> .
The Miami Dolphins joined the league for a fee of $7.5 million and started play in the AFL's Eastern Division in 1966.
Escalation and merger (1966–67).
In 1966, the rivalry between the AFL and NFL reached an all-time peak.
On April 7,  <START:person> Joe Foss <END>  resigned as AFL commissioner.
His successor was Oakland Raiders head coach and general manager  <START:person> Al Davis <END> , who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise.
No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under  <START:person> Davis <END>  started to recruit players already on NFL squads.
 <START:person> Davis <END> 's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL.
Although  <START:person> Davis <END> 's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues.
Alarmed with the rate of spending in the league, Hilton Hotels forced  <START:person> Barron Hilton <END>  to relinquish his stake in the Chargers as a condition of maintaining his leadership role with the hotel chain.
The same month  <START:person> Davis <END>  was named commissioner, several NFL owners, along with Dallas Cowboys general manager  <START:person> Tex Schramm <END> , secretly approached  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  and other AFL owners and asked the AFL to merge.
They held a series of secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching.
Hunt and  <START:person> Schramm <END>  completed the basic groundwork for a merger of the two leagues by the end of May, and on June 8, 1966, the merger was officially announced.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft.
The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues.
The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, NFL commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  would remain as commissioner of the merged league, and additional expansion teams would eventually be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring it to a 28-team league.
The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years.
In protest,  <START:person> Davis <END>  resigned as AFL commissioner on July 25 rather than remain until the completion of the merger, and  <START:person> Milt Woodard <END>  was named President of the AFL.
On January 15, 1967, the first-ever World Championship Game between the champions of the two separate professional football leagues, the AFL-NFL Championship Game (retroactively referred to as Super Bowl I), was played in Los Angeles.
After a close first half, the NFL champion Green Bay Packers overwhelmed the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs, 35–10.
The loss reinforced for many the notion that the AFL was an inferior league.
Packers head coach  <START:person> Vince Lombardi <END>  stated after the game, "I do not think they are as good as the top teams in the National Football League."
The second AFL-NFL Championship (Super Bowl II) yielded a similar result.
The Oakland Raiders—who had easily beaten the Houston Oilers to win their first AFL championship—were overmatched by the Packers, 33–14.
The more experienced Packers capitalized on a number of Raiders miscues and never trailed.
Green Bay defensive tackle  <START:person> Henry Jordan <END>  offered a compliment to Oakland and the AFL, when he said, "... the AFL is becoming much more sophisticated on offense.
I think the league has always had good personnel, but the blocks were subtler and better conceived in this game."
The AFL added its tenth and final team on May 24, 1967, when it awarded the league's second expansion franchise to an ownership group from Cincinnati, Ohio, headed by NFL legend  <START:person> Paul Brown <END> .
Although  <START:person> Brown <END>  had intended to join the NFL, he agreed to join the AFL when he learned that his team would be included in the NFL once the merger was completed.
The Cincinnati Bengals began play in the 1968 season, finishing last in the Western Division.
Legitimacy and the end of an era (1968–70).
While many AFL players and observers believed their league was the equal of the NFL, their first two Super Bowl performances did nothing to prove it.
However, on November 17, 1968, when NBC cut away from a game between the Jets and Raiders to air the children's movie " <START:person> Heidi <END> ," the ensuing uproar helped disprove the notion that fans still considered the AFL an inferior product.
The perception of AFL inferiority forever changed on January 12, 1969, when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.
The Colts, who entered the contest favored by as many as 18 points, had completed the 1968 NFL season with a 13–1 record, and won the NFL title with a convincing 34–0 win over the Cleveland Browns.
Led by their stalwart defense—which allowed a record-low 144 points—the 1968 Colts were considered one of the best-ever NFL teams.
By contrast, the Jets had allowed 280 points, the highest total for any division winner in the two leagues.
They had also only narrowly beaten the favored Oakland Raiders 27–23 in the AFL championship game.
Jets quarterback  <START:person> Joe Namath <END>  recalled that in the days leading up to the game, he grew increasingly angry when told New York had no chance to beat Baltimore.
Three days before the game, a frustrated  <START:person> Namath <END>  responded to a heckler at the Touchdown Club in Miami by declaring, "We're going to win Sunday, I'll guarantee you."
 <START:person> Namath <END>  and the Jets made good on his guarantee as they held the Colts scoreless until late in the fourth quarter.
The Jets won, 16–7, in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in American sports history.
With the win, the AFL finally achieved parity with the NFL and legitimized the merger of the two leagues.
That notion was reinforced one year later in Super Bowl IV, when the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs upset the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings, 23–7, in the last championship game to be played between the two leagues.
The  <START:person> Vikings <END> , favored by 12½ points, were held to just 67 rushing yards.
The last game in AFL history was the AFL All-Star Game, held in Houston's Astrodome on January 17, 1970.
The Western All-Stars, led by Chargers quarterback  <START:person> John Hadl <END> , defeated the Eastern All-Stars, 26–3.
 <START:person> Hadl <END>  was named the game's Most Valuable Player.
Prior to the start of the 1970 NFL season, the merged league was organized into two conferences of three divisions each.
All ten AFL teams made up the bulk of the new American Football Conference.
To avoid having an inequitable number of teams in each conference, the leagues voted to move three NFL teams to the AFC.
Motivated by the prospect of an intrastate rivalry with the Bengals as well as by personal animosity toward  <START:person> Paul Brown <END> , Cleveland Browns owner  <START:person> Art Modell <END>  quickly offered to include his team in the AFC.
He helped persuade the Pittsburgh Steelers (the Browns' archrivals) and Baltimore Colts (who shared the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. market with the Washington Redskins) to follow suit, and each team received US $3 million to make the switch.
All the other NFL squads became part of the National Football Conference.
Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver  <START:person> Charlie Joiner <END> , who started his career with the Houston Oilers (1969), was the last AFL player active in professional football, retiring after the 1986 season, when he played for the San Diego Chargers.
Legacy.
Overview.
The American Football League stands as the only professional football league to successfully compete against the NFL.
When the two leagues merged in 1970, all ten AFL franchises and their statistics became part of the new NFL.
Every other professional league that had competed against the NFL before the AFL-NFL merger had folded completely: the three previous leagues named "American Football League" and the All-America Football Conference.
From an earlier AFL (1936–1937), only the Cleveland Rams (now the St. Louis Rams) joined the NFL and are currently operating, as are the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers from the AAFC.
A third AAFC team, the Baltimore Colts (not related to the 1953–1983 Baltimore Colts or to the current Indianapolis Colts franchise), played only one year in the NFL, disbanding at the end of the 1950 season.
The league resulting from the merger was a 26-team juggernaut (since expanded to 32) with television rights covering all of the Big Three television networks and teams in close proximity to almost all of the top 40 metropolitan areas, a fact that has precluded any other competing league from gaining traction since the merger; failed attempts to mimic the AFL's success included the World Football League (1974–75), United States Football League (1983–85), XFL (2001) and United Football League (2009–2012).
The AFL was also the most successful of numerous upstart leagues of the 1960s and 1970s that attempted to challenge a major professional league's dominance.
All nine teams that were in the AFL at the time the merger was agreed upon were accepted into the league intact (as was the tenth team added between the time of the merger's agreement and finalization).
For comparison, the World Hockey Association (1972–79) managed to have four of its six remaining teams merged into the National Hockey League, which actually caused the older league to contract a franchise, but WHA teams were forced to disperse the majority of their rosters and restart as expansion teams.
The merged WHA teams were also not financially sound, as three of the four were forced to relocate within 20 years.
The American Basketball Association (1967–76) managed to have only four of its teams merged into the National Basketball Association, and the rest of the league was forced to fold.
The Continental League, a proposed third league for Major League Baseball that was to begin play in 1961, never played a single game.
Rule changes.
The NFL adopted some of the innovations introduced by the AFL immediately and a few others in the years following the merger.
One was including the names on player jerseys.
The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a stopwatch used by the referee.
The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960.
The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it.
The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s).
All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the "AFL" than like the old-line NFL.
The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.
Television.
The NFL also adapted how the AFL used the growing power of televised football games, which were bolstered with the help of major network contracts (first with ABC and later with NBC).
With that first contract with ABC, the AFL adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds were divided equally among member clubs.
It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the Dallas Texans and the defending champion Houston Oilers.
At the time it was the longest professional football championship game ever played.
The AFL also appealed to fans by offering a flashier style of play (just like the ABA in basketball), compared to the more conservative game of the NFL.
Long passes ("bombs") were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as  <START:person> John Hadl <END> ,  <START:person> Daryle Lamonica <END>  and  <START:person> Len Dawson <END> .
Despite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks.
For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL.
It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.
Expanding and reintroducing the sport to more cities.
The AFL took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises.
 <START:person> Hunt <END> 's vision not only brought a new professional football league to California and New York, but introduced the sport to Colorado, restored it to Texas and later to fast-growing Florida, as well as bringing it to New England for the first time in 12 years.
Buffalo, having lost its original NFL franchise in 1929 and turned down by the NFL at least twice (1940 and 1950) for a replacement, returned to the NFL with the merger.
The return of football to Kansas City was the first time that city had seen professional football since the NFL's Kansas City Blues/Cowboys of the 1920s; the arrival of the Chiefs, and the contemporary arrival of the St. Louis Football Cardinals, brought professional football back to Missouri for the first time since the temporary St. Louis Gunners of 1934.
If not for the AFL, at least 17 of today's NFL teams would probably never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and seven clubs that were instigated by the AFL's presence to some degree.
Three NFL franchises were awarded as a direct result of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Minnesota Vikings, who were awarded to  <START:person> Max Winter <END>  in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Atlanta Falcons, whose franchise went to  <START:person> Rankin Smith <END>  to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's Miami Dolphins; and the New Orleans Saints, because of successful anti-trust legislation which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians.
In the case of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL had long sought to return to the Dallas area after the Dallas Texans folded in 1952, but was originally met with strong opposition by Washington Redskins owner  <START:person> George Preston Marshall <END> , who had enjoyed a monopoly as the only NFL team to represent the American South.
 <START:person> Marshall <END>  later changed his position after future-Cowboys owner  <START:person> Clint Murchison <END>  bought the rights to Washington's fight song "Hail to the Redskins" and threatened to prevent  <START:person> Marshall <END>  from playing it at games.
By then, the NFL wanted to quickly award the new Dallas franchise to  <START:person> Murchison <END>  so the team could immediately begin play and complete with the AFL's Texans.
As a result, the Cowboys played its inaugural season in 1960 without the benefit of the NFL draft.
As part of the merger agreement, additional expansion teams would be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring the league to 28 franchises; this requirement was fulfilled when the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began play in 1976.
In addition, had it not been for the existence of the Oilers from 1960 to 1996, the Houston Texans also would likely not exist today; the 2002 expansion team restored professional football in Houston after the original charter AFL member Oilers relocated to become the Tennessee Titans.
 <START:person> Kevin Sherrington <END>  of "The Dallas Morning News" has argued that the presence of AFL and the subsequent merger radically altered the fortunes of the Pittsburgh Steelers, saving the team "from stinking".
Before the merger, the Steelers had long been one of the NFL's worst teams.
Constantly lacking the money to build a quality team, the Steelers had only posted eight winning seasons, and just one playoff appearance, since their first year of existence in 1933.
They also finished with a 1-13 record in 1969, tied with the Chicago Bears for the worst record in the NFL.
The $3 million indemnity that the Steelers received for joining the AFC with the rest of the former AFL teams after the merger helped them rebuild into a contender, drafting eventual-Pro Football Hall of Famers like  <START:person> Terry Bradshaw <END>  and  <START:person> Joe Greene <END> , and ultimately winning four Super Bowls in the 1970s.
Since the 1970 merger, the Steelers have the NFL's highest winning percentage, the most total victories, the most trips to either conference championship game, are tied with the Dallas Cowboys for the most trips to the Super Bowl, and have won an NFL-record six Super Bowl championships.
Effects on players.
Perhaps the greatest social legacy of the AFL was the domino effect of its policy of being more liberal than the entrenched NFL in offering opportunity for black players.
While the NFL was still emerging from thirty years of segregation influenced by Washington Redskins' owner  <START:person> George Preston Marshall <END> , the AFL actively recruited from small and predominantly black colleges.
The AFL's color-blindness led not only to the explosion of black talent on the field, but to the eventual entry of blacks into scouting, coordinating, and ultimately head coaching positions, long after the league ceased to exist.
The AFL's free agents came from several sources.
Some were players who could not find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the Canadian Football League.
In the late 1950s, many players released by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their luck with the CFL, and later returned to the states to play in the AFL.
In the league's first years, players such as Oilers'  <START:person> George Blanda <END> , Chargers/Bills'  <START:person> Jack Kemp <END> , Texans'  <START:person> Len Dawson <END> , the NY Titans'  <START:person> Don Maynard <END> , Raiders/Patriots/Jets'  <START:person> Babe Parilli <END> , Pats'  <START:person> Bob Dee <END>  proved to be AFL standouts.
Other players such as the Broncos'  <START:person> Frank Tripucka <END> , the Pats'  <START:person> Gino Cappelletti <END> , the Bills'  <START:person> Cookie Gilchrist <END>  and the Chargers' Tobin Rote,  <START:person> Sam DeLuca <END>  and  <START:person> Dave Kocourek <END>  also made their mark to give the fledgling league badly needed credibility.
Rounding out this mix of potential talent were the true "free agents", the walk-ons and the "wanna-be's", who tried out in droves for the chance to play professional American football.
After the AFL-NFL merger agreement in 1966, and after the AFL's Jets defeated the "best team in the history of the NFL", the Colts, a popular misconception fostered by the NFL and spread by media reports was that the AFL defeated the NFL because of the Common Draft instituted in 1967.
This apparently was meant to assert that the AFL could not achieve parity as long as it had to compete with the NFL in the draft.
But the 1968 Jets had less than a handful of "common draftees".
Their stars were honed in the AFL, many of them since the Titans days.
As noted below, the AFL got its share of stars long before the "common draft".
Players who chose the AFL to develop their talent included  <START:person> Lance Alworth <END>  and  <START:person> Ron Mix <END>  of the Chargers, who had also been drafted by the NFL's San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts respectively.
Both eventually were elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame after earning recognition during their careers as being among the best at their positions.
Among specific teams, the 1964 Buffalo Bills stood out by holding their opponents to a pro football record 913 yards rushing on 300 attempts, while also recording fifty quarterback sacks in a 14-game schedule.
Another example is cited by the University of Kansas website, which describes the 1961 Bluebonnet Bowl, won by  <START:person> KU <END> , and goes on to say "Two Kansas players, quarterback  <START:person> John Hadl <END>  and fullback  <START:person> Curtis McClinton <END> , signed professional contracts on the field immediately after the conclusion of the game.
 <START:person> Hadl <END>  inked a deal with the "[AFL]" San Diego Chargers, and  <START:person> McClinton <END>  went to the "[AFL]" Dallas Texans."
Between them, in their careers  <START:person> Hadl <END>  and  <START:person> McClinton <END>  combined for an American Football League Rookie of the Year award, seven AFL All-Star selections, two Pro Bowl selections, a team MVP award, two AFL All-Star Game MVP awards, two AFL championships, and a World Championship.
And these were players selected by the AFL long "before" the "Common Draft".
In 2009, a five-part series, "", on the "Showtime Network", refuted many of the long-held misconceptions about the AFL.
In it,  <START:person> Abner Haynes <END>  tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the  <START:person> Haynes <END>  home; the NFL Cowboys'  <START:person> Tex Schramm <END>  is quoted as saying that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's Dallas Texans, they would very likely have lost;  <START:person> George Blanda <END>  makes a case for more AFL players being inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of  <START:person> Famer Willie Brown <END>  was cut by the Houston Oilers because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker  <START:person> Charlie Hennigan <END>  in practice.
Later, when  <START:person> Brown <END>  was with the Broncos,  <START:person> Hennigan <END>  needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break  <START:person> Lionel Taylor <END> 's Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season.
 <START:person> Hennigan <END>  caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by  <START:person> Brown <END> :  <START:person> Blanda <END> 's point being that if  <START:person> Hennigan <END>  could do so well against a Hall of Fame db, he deserves induction, as well.
Influence on professional football coaching.
The AFL also spawned coaches whose style and techniques have profoundly affected the play of professional football to this day.
In addition to AFL greats like  <START:person> Hank Stram <END> ,  <START:person> Lou Saban <END> ,  <START:person> Sid Gillman <END>  and  <START:person> Al Davis <END>  were eventual hall of fame coaches such as  <START:person> Bill Walsh <END> , a protégé of  <START:person> Davis <END>  with the AFL Oakland Raiders for one season; and  <START:person> Chuck Noll <END> , who worked for  <START:person> Gillman <END>  and the AFL LA/San Diego Chargers from 1960 through 1965.
Others include  <START:person> Buddy Ryan <END>  (AFL's New York Jets),  <START:person> Chuck Knox <END>  (Jets),  <START:person> Walt Michaels <END>  (Jets), and  <START:person> John Madden <END>  (AFL's Oakland Raiders).
Additionally, many prominent coaches began their pro football careers as players in the AFL, including  <START:person> Sam Wyche <END>  (Cincinnati Bengals),  <START:person> Marty Schottenheimer <END>  (Buffalo Bills),  <START:person> Wayne Fontes <END>  (Jets), and two-time Super Bowl winner  <START:person> Tom Flores <END>  (Oakland Raiders).
 <START:person> Flores <END>  also has a Super Bowl ring as a player (1969 Kansas City Chiefs).
AFL 50th Anniversary Celebration.
As the influence of the AFL continues through the present, the 50th anniversary of its launch was celebrated during 2009.
The season-long celebration began in August with the 2009 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio between two AFC teams (as opposed to the AFC-vs-NFC format the game first adopted in 1971).
The opponents were two of the original AFL franchises, the Buffalo Bills and Tennessee Titans (the former Houston Oilers).
Bills' owner  <START:person> Ralph C. Wilson Jr. <END>  (a 2009 Hall of Fame inductee) and Titans' owner  <START:person> Bud Adams <END>  were the only surviving members of the Foolish Club, the eight original owners of AFL franchises.
The Hall of Fame Game was the first of several "Legacy Weekends," during which each of the "original eight" AFL teams sported uniforms from their AFL era.
Each of the 8 teams took part in at least two such "legacy" games.
On-field officials also wore red-and-white-striped AFL uniforms during these games.
In the fall of 2009, the Showtime pay-cable network premiered "", a 5-part documentary series produced by NFL Films that features vintage game film and interviews as well as more recent interviews with those associated with the AFL.
The NFL sanctioned a variety of "Legacy" gear to celebrate the AFL anniversary, such as "throwback" jerseys, T-shirts, signs, pennants and banners, including items with the logos and colors of the Dallas Texans, Houston Oilers, and New York Titans, the three of the Original Eight AFL teams which have changed names or venues.
A December 5, 2009 story by  <START:person> Ken Belson <END>  in the "New York Times" quotes league officials as stating that AFL "Legacy" gear made up twenty to thirty percent of the league's annual $3 billion merchandise income.
Fan favorites were the Denver Broncos' vertically striped socks, which could not be re-stocked quickly enough.
AFL franchises.
Today, two of the NFL's eight divisions are composed entirely of former AFL teams, the AFC West (Broncos, Chargers, Chiefs, and Raiders) and the AFC East (Bills, Dolphins, Jets, and Patriots).
Additionally, the Bengals now play in the AFC North and the Tennessee Titans (formerly the Oilers) play in the AFC South.
AFL playoffs.
From 1960 to 1968, the AFL determined its champion via a single-elimination playoff game between the winners of its two divisions.
The home teams alternated each year by division, so in 1968 the Jets hosted the Raiders, even though Oakland had a better record (this was changed in 1969).
In 1963, the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots finished tied with identical records of 7–6–1 in the AFL East Division.
There was no tie-breaker protocol in place, so a one-game playoff was held in War Memorial Stadium in December.
The visiting Patriots defeated the host Bills 26–8.
The Patriots traveled to San Diego as the Chargers completed a three-game season sweep over the weary Patriots with a 51–10 victory.
A similar situation occurred in the 1968 season, when the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs finished the regular season tied with identical records of 12–2 in the AFL West Division.
The Raiders beat the Chiefs 41–6 in a division playoff to qualify for the AFL Championship Game.
In 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, Professional Football's first "wild card" playoffs were conducted.
A four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other division.
The Chiefs upset the Raiders in Oakland 17–7 in the league's Championship, the final AFL game played.
The Kansas City Chiefs were the first Super Bowl champion to win two road playoff games and the first wildcard team to win the Super Bowl, although the term "wildcard" was coined by the media, and not used officially until several years later.
AFL Championship Games.
"Italics" – Super Bowl Appearance, Bold Super Bowl Victory AFL All-Star games.
The AFL did not play an All-Star game after its first season in 1960, but did stage All-Star games for the 1961 through 1969 seasons.
All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions played each other after every season except 1965.
That season, the league champion Buffalo Bills played all-stars from the other teams.
After the 1964 season, the AFL All-Star game had been scheduled for early 1965 in New Orleans' Tulane Stadium.
After numerous black players were refused service by a number of area hotels and businesses, black and white players alike called for a boycott.
Led by Bills players such as  <START:person> Cookie Gilchrist <END> , the players successfully lobbied to have the game moved to Houston's Jeppesen Stadium.
All-Time AFL Team.
As chosen by 1969 AFL Hall of Fame Selection Committee Members: AFL records.
The following is a sample of some records set during the existence of the league.
The NFL considers AFL statistics and records equivalent to its own.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer  Albrecht Dürer <END>  (; ]; 21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528) was a German painter, printmaker, mathematician, and theorist born in Nuremberg.
His high-quality woodcut prints established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, and he has been conventionally regarded as the greatest artist of the Northern Renaissance.
His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books.
The woodcuts, such as the "Apocalypse" series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work.
His well-known engravings include the "Knight, Death, and the Devil" (1513), "Saint  <START:person> Jerome <END>  in his Study" (1514) and "Melencolia I" (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation.
His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.
This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.
Early life (1471–90).
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had between fourteen and eighteen children.
His father,  <START:person> Albrecht Dürer the Elder <END> , was a successful goldsmith, originally  <START:person> Ajtósi <END> , who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from Ajtós, near Gyula in Hungary.
The German name "Dürer" is a translation from the Hungarian, "Ajtósi".
Initially, it was "Türer," meaning doormaker, which is "ajtós" in Hungarian (from "ajtó", meaning door).
A door is featured in the coat-of-arms the family acquired.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer <END>  the Younger later changed "Türer", his father's diction of the family's surname, to "Dürer", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer the Elder <END>  married  <START:person> Barbara Holper <END> , the daughter of his master, when he himself became a master in 1467.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's godfather was  <START:person> Anton Koberger <END> , who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's birth and quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four printing-presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad.
 <START:person> Koberger <END> 's most famous publication was the "Nuremberg Chronicle", published in 1493 in German and Latin editions.
It contained an unprecedented 1,809 woodcut illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the Wolgemut workshop.
Dürer may well have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.
Because  <START:person> Dürer <END>  left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources.
After a few years of school,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father.
Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to  <START:person> Michael Wolgemut <END>  at the age of fifteen in 1486.
A self-portrait, a drawing in silverpoint, is dated 1484 ( <START:person> Albertina <END> , Vienna) "when I was a child," as his later inscription says.
Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books.
Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades.
It had strong links with Italy, especially Venice, a relatively short distance across the Alps.
"Wanderjahre" and marriage (1490–94).
After completing his term of apprenticeship,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  followed the common German custom of taking "Wanderjahre"—in effect gap years —in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Dürer was to spend about four years away.
He left in 1490, possibly to work under  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END> , the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Dürer's arrival at Colmar in 1492.
It is unclear where  <START:person> Dürer <END>  travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to Frankfurt and the Netherlands.
In Colmar,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was welcomed by  <START:person> Schongauer <END> 's brothers, the goldsmiths  <START:person> Caspar <END>  and  <START:person> Paul <END>  and the painter  <START:person> Ludwig <END> .
In 1493 Dürer went to Strasbourg, where he would have experienced the sculpture of  <START:person> Nikolaus Gerhaert <END> .
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's first painted self-portrait (now in the Louvre) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancée in Nuremberg.
In early 1492  <START:person> Dürer <END>  travelled to Basel to stay with another brother of  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END> , the goldsmith  <START:person> Georg <END> .
Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was married to  <START:person> Agnes Frey <END>  following an arrangement made during his absence.
 <START:person> Agnes <END>  was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city.
However, no children resulted from the marriage.
First journey to Italy (1494–95).
Within three months of his marriage,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of plague in Nuremberg.
He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps.
Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving "Nemesis".
In Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world.
Through Wolgemut's tutelage,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had learned how to make prints in drypoint and design woodcuts in the German style, based on the works of  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END>  and the Housebook Master.
He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him.
He wrote that  <START:person> Giovanni Bellini <END>  was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice.
His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably  <START:person> Antonio Pollaiuolo <END>  with his interest in the proportions of the body,  <START:person> Mantegna <END> ,  <START:person> Lorenzo di Credi <END>  and others.
Dürer probably also visited Padua and Mantua on this trip.
Return to Nuremberg (1495–1505).
On his return to Nuremberg in 1495,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this).
Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513.
His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as "The Men's Bath House" (ca.
1496).
These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.
It is now thought unlikely that  <START:person> Dürer <END>  cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman.
However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.
Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block.
Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.
His famous series of sixteen great designs for the "Apocalypse" is dated 1498, as is his engraving of" St. Michael Fighting the Dragon".
He made the first seven scenes of the "Great Passion" in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints.
The "Seven Sorrows Polyptych", commissioned by  <START:person> Frederick III <END>  of Saxony in 1496, was executed by  <START:person> Dürer <END>  and his assistants c. 1500.
Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the "Life of the Virgin", which he did not finish for some years.
Neither these, nor the "Great Passion," were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.
During the same period  <START:person> Dürer <END>  trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings.
It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith.
In 1496 he executed the "Prodigal Son", which the Italian Renaissance art historian  <START:person> Giorgio Vasari <END>  singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality.
He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably "Nemesis" (1502), "The Sea Monster" (1498), and "Saint  <START:person> Eustace <END> " (c.
1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals.
His landscapes of this period, such as "Pond in the Woods" and "Willow Mill", are quite different from his earlier watercolours.
There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography.
He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures.
Prints are highly portable and these works made Dürer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.
The Venetian artist  <START:person> Jacopo <END>  de' Barbari, whom  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and  <START:person> Dürer <END>  said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and proportion from him.
De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so  <START:person> Dürer <END>  began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation.
A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of "Adam and Eve" (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces.
This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.
Dürer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the "Betende Hände" (English: "Praying Hands", c. 1508  <START:person> Albertina <END> , Vienna), a study for an apostle in the  <START:person> Heller <END>  altarpiece.
He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his "Young Hare" (1502) and the "Great Piece of Turf" (1503, both also  <START:person> Albertina <END> ).
Second journey to Italy (1505–1507).
In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in tempera on linen.
These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the Paumgartner altarpiece and the "Adoration of the Magi".
In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507.
By this time  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied.
In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo.
This was the altar-piece known as the "Adoration of the Virgin" or the "Feast of Rose Garlands".
It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence.
It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor  <START:person> Rudolf II <END>  and taken to Prague.
Other paintings  <START:person> Dürer <END>  produced in Venice include "The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch", "Christ Disputing with the Doctors" (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.
Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507–1520).
Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520.
His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including  <START:person> Raphael <END> ,  <START:person> Giovanni Bellini <END>  and — mainly through  <START:person> Lorenzo di Credi <END>  —  <START:person> Leonardo da Vinci <END> .
Between 1507 and 1511  <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: "Adam and Eve" (1507), "The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand" (1508, for  <START:person> Frederick <END>  of Saxony), "Virgin with the Iris" (1508), the altarpiece "Assumption of the Virgin" (1509, for  <START:person> Jacob Heller <END>  of Frankfurt), and "Adoration of the Trinity" (1511, for  <START:person> Matthaeus Landauer <END> ).
During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the  <START:person> Life of the Virgin <END> , both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series.
The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of chiaroscuro modelling effects, creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.
Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512.
Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516.
However, in 1513 and 1514  <START:person> Dürer <END>  created his three most famous engravings: "Knight, Death, and the Devil" (1513, probably based on  <START:person> Erasmus <END> 's treatise "Enchiridion militis Christiani"), "St.
 <START:person> Jerome <END>  in his Study", and the much-debated "Melencolia I" (both 1514).
In 1515, he created his "woodcut of a Rhinoceros" which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself.
An image of the Indian rhinoceros, the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.
In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515 and portraits in tempera on linen in 1516.
Patronage of  <START:person> Maximilian I. From <END>  1512,  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  I became  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's major patron.
His commissions included "The Triumphal Arch", a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by  <START:person> Pirckheimer <END> 's translation of  <START:person> Horapollo <END> 's "Hieroglyphica".
The design program and explanations were devised by  <START:person> Johannes Stabius <END> , the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter  <START:person> Jörg Kölderer <END>  and the woodcutting itself by  <START:person> Hieronymous Andreae <END> , with  <START:person> Dürer <END>  as designer-in-chief.
The Arch was followed by "The Triumphal Procession", the program of which was worked out in 1512 by and includes woodcuts by  <START:person> Albrecht Altdorfer <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Springinklee <END> , as well as Dürer.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in lithography.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including  <START:person> Lucas Cranach the Elder <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Baldung <END> .
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before  <START:person> Maximilian <END> 's death in 1519.
Journey to the Netherlands (1520–21).
 <START:person> Maximilian <END> 's sudden death came at a time when  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was concerned he was losing "my sight and freedom of hand" (perhaps caused by arthritis) and increasingly affected by the writings of  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> .
In July 1520  <START:person> Dürer <END>  made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor,  <START:person> Charles V <END> , who was to be crowned at Aachen.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal.
In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of  <START:person> Stefan Lochner <END> ), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw  <START:person> Michelangelo <END> 's  <START:person> Madonna <END>  of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired  <START:person> van Eyck <END> 's altarpiece), and Zeeland.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much.
This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time.
Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.
While providing valuable documentary evidence, Dürer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one.
For example,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  offered his last portrait of  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  to his daughter,  <START:person> Margaret <END>  of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after  <START:person> Margaret <END>  disliked the portrait and declined to accept it.
During this trip he also met  <START:person> Bernard van Orley <END> ,  <START:person> Jan Provoost <END> ,  <START:person> Gerard Horenbout <END> ,  <START:person> Jean Mone <END> ,  <START:person> Joachim Patinir <END>  and  <START:person> Tommaso Vincidor <END> , though he did not, it seems, meet  <START:person> Quentin Matsys <END> .
At the request of Christian II of Denmark,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait.
There he saw "the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land"—the Aztec treasure that  <START:person> Hernán Cortés <END>  had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor  <START:person> Charles V <END>  following the fall of Mexico.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote that this treasure "was much more beautiful to me than miracles.
These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins".
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies.
Having secured his pension,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps malaria —which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.
Final years in Nuremberg (1521–28).
On his return to Nuremberg,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a  <START:person> Sacra Conversazione <END> , though neither was completed.
This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and fortification.
However, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  produced comparatively little as an artist.
In painting, there was only a portrait of , a , , and two panels showing St.  <START:person> John <END>  with St. Peter in and St. Paul with St. Mark in the .
This last great work, the Four Apostles, was given by  <START:person> Dürer <END>  to the City of Nuremberg—although he was given 100 guilders in return.
As for engravings,  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise.
The portraits include  <START:person> Cardinal-Elector Albert <END>  of Mainz;  <START:person> Frederick <END>  the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar  <START:person> Willibald Pirckheimer <END> ;  <START:person> Philipp Melanchthon <END> , and  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  of Rotterdam.
For those of the Cardinal,  <START:person> Melanchthon <END> , and  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician  <START:person> Ulrich Starck <END> ,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.
Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend  <START:person> Willibald Pirckheimer <END> , whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images.
He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  and other scholars.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime.
"The Four Books on Measurement" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and  <START:person> Kepler <END> .
The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527.
"The Four Books on Human Proportion" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins—a considerable sum.
His large house (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer  <START:person> Bernhard Walther <END> ), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark.
It is now a museum.
He is buried in the "Johannisfriedhof" cemetery.
Dürer and the Reformation.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> 's ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote of his desire to draw  <START:person> Luther <END>  in his diary in 1520: "And God help me that I may go to Dr.  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> ; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties."
In a letter to  <START:person> Nicholas Kratzer <END>  in 1524,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote "because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics."
Most tellingly,  <START:person> Pirckheimer <END>  wrote in a letter to  <START:person> Johann Tscherte <END>  in 1530: "I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our  <START:person> Albert <END>  of blessed memory...but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse."
Dürer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525.
Notably,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had contacts with various reformers, such as  <START:person> Zwingli <END> ,  <START:person> Andreas Karlstadt <END> , Melanchthon,  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  and  <START:person> Cornelius Grapheus <END>  from whom  <START:person> Dürer <END>  received  <START:person> Luther <END> 's 'Babylonian Captivity' in 1520.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's later works have also been claimed to show Protestant sympathies.
For example, his woodcut of "The Last Supper" of 1523 has often been understood to have an evangelical theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the Gospel, as well the inclusion of the Eucharistic cup, an expression of Protestant utraquism, although this interpretation has been questioned.
The delaying of the engraving of St Philip, completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was not an iconoclast, in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.
Legacy and influence.
Dürer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities.
His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as  <START:person> Raphael <END> ,  <START:person> Titian <END> , and  <START:person> Parmigianino <END> , all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.
His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the "Little Masters" who attempted few large engravings but continued  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's themes in small, rather cramped compositions.
 <START:person> Lucas van Leyden <END>  was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century.
The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Dürer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ( <START:person> Giulio Campagnola <END>  and  <START:person> Christofano Robetta <END> ), or whole prints ( <START:person> Marcantonio Raimondi <END>  and  <START:person> Agostino Veneziano <END> ).
However,  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's influence became less dominant after 1515, when  <START:person> Marcantonio <END>  perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.
In painting,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles.
His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the "Dürer Renaissance" of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by  <START:person> D'Arcy Thompson <END>  in his book "On Growth and Form".
The Lutheran Church remembers  <START:person> Dürer <END>  as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with  <START:person> Lucas Cranach the Elder <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Burgkmair <END> .
The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and  <START:person> Matthias Grünewald <END>  on August 5.
Theoretical works.
In all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the German language rather than in Latin, Dürer used graphic expressions based on a vernacular, craftsmen's language.
For example, 'Schneckenlinie' ('snail-line') was his term for a spiral form.
Thus,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  contributed to the expansion in German prose which  <START:person> Martin Luther <END>  had begun with his translation of the Bible.
"Four Books on Measurement".
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on geometry is called the "Four Books on Measurement" ("Underweysung der  <START:person> Messung <END>  mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt" or "Instructions for Measuring with Compass and Ruler").
The first book focuses on linear geometry.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's geometric constructions include helices, conchoids and epicycloids.
He also draws on Apollonius, and  <START:person> Johannes Werner <END> 's 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522.
The second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular polygons.
Here Dürer favours the methods of  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  over Euclid.
The third book applies these principles of geometry to architecture, engineering and typography.
In architecture Dürer cites  <START:person> Vitruvius <END>  but elaborates his own classical designs and columns.
In typography,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent.
However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system.
The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra.
Here Dürer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention.
In all these,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  shows the objects as nets.
Finally,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective.
It was in Bologna that Dürer was taught (possibly by  <START:person> Luca Pacioli <END>  or  <START:person> Bramante <END> ) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della  <START:person> Francesca <END> .
He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by  <START:person> Alberti <END>  and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of  <START:person> Leonardo da Vinci <END> .
Although  <START:person> Dürer <END>  made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles.
In addition to these geometrical constructions,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  discusses in this last book of "Underweysung der Messung" an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.
"Four Books on Human Proportion".
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on human proportions is called the "Four Books on Human Proportion" ("Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion") of 1528.
The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height.
Dürer based these constructions on both  <START:person> Vitruvius <END>  and empirical observations of, "two to three hundred living persons," in his own words.
The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an Albertian system, which Dürer probably learned from  <START:person> Francesco di Giorgio <END> 's 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525.
In the third book, Dürer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of convex and concave mirrors; here  <START:person> Dürer <END>  also deals with human physiognomy.
The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.
Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Dürer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  rejected  <START:person> Alberti <END> 's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety.
Nonetheless,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code.
In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naïve approval (' <START:person> Wohlgefallen <END> ') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass').
However, unlike  <START:person> Alberti <END>  and  <START:person> Leonardo <END> ,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images.
Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Dürer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.
In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that "one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year."
List of works.
For lists of  <START:person> Albrecht Dürer <END> 's works, see:   <START:person> Ann Widdecombe  Ann Noreen Widdecombe <END> , DSG (born 4 October 1947) is a former British Conservative Party politician and has been a novelist since 2000.
She is a Privy Councillor and was the Member of Parliament for Maidstone from 1987 to 1997 and for Maidstone and The Weald from 1997 to 2010.
She was a social conservative and a member of the Conservative Christian Fellowship.
She retired from politics at the 2010 general election.
Since 2002 she has also made numerous television and radio appearances, including as a television presenter.
She is a convert from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism.
As an MP,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was known for opposing the legality of abortion, her opposition to various issues of LGBT equality, her support for the re-introduction of the death penalty and the retention of blasphemy laws.
Early life.
Born in Bath, Somerset,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is the daughter of  <START:person> Rita Noreen <END>  (née  <START:person> Plummer <END> ; 1911-2007) and Ministry of Defence civil servant  <START:person> James Murray Widdecombe <END> .
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END> 's maternal grandfather,  <START:person> James Henry Plummer <END> , was born to an Irish Catholic family of English descent in Crosshaven, County Cork in 1874.
She attended the Royal Naval School in Singapore, and La Sainte Union Convent School in Bath.
She then read Latin at the University of Birmingham and later attended Lady  <START:person> Margaret Hall <END> , Oxford, to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE).
She worked for Unilever (1973–75) and then as an administrator at the University of London (1975–87) before entering Parliament.
Councillor.
From 1976 to 1978,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was a councillor on Runnymede District Council in Surrey.
She contested the seat of Burnley in Lancashire in the 1979 general election and then, against  <START:person> David Owen <END> , the Plymouth Devonport seat in the 1983 general election.
Member of Parliament.
She was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1987 general election as member for the constituency of Maidstone (which became Maidstone and The Weald in 1997).
Political views.
As an MP,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  expressed conservative views, including opposition to abortion; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become Health Secretary as long as this involved responsibility for abortions.
Although a committed Christian, she has characterised the issue as one of life and death on which her view had been the same when she was agnostic.
Along with  <START:person> John Gummer <END>  MP, she converted from the Church of England to the Catholic Church following the decision of the Church of England on the Ordination of women as priests.
In her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, she called for a zero tolerance policy of prosecution, albeit with only £100 fines as the punishment, for users of cannabis.
This was well received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  consistently opposed LGBT equality.
On the issue of an equal age of consent, she said in 2000: "I do not believe that issues of equality should override the imperatives of protecting the young."
In 2003,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  proposed an amendment opposing repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act, which banned the promotion of homosexuality by local governments.
Out of the 17 parliamentary votes considered by the Public Whip website to concern equal rights for homosexuals,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  took the opposing position in 15 cases, not being present at the other two votes.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has also expressed her opposition to same-sex marriage, introduced by  <START:person> David Cameron <END> 's government in 2014, claiming that "the state must have a preferred model" and "a union that is generally open to procreation".
She is a committed animal lover and one of the few Conservative MPs to have consistently voted for the ban on fox hunting.
She has expressed a variety of views on climate change but has been opposed to legislation reducing emissions.
Her views on the subject appear to have hardened over time.
In 2007, she wrote that she did not want to belittle the issue but was sceptical of the claims that specific actions would prevent catastrophe, then in 2008 that her doubts had been "crystalised" by  <START:person> Nigel Lawson <END> 's book "An Appeal to Reason", before stating in 2009 that "There is no climate change, hasn’t anybody looked out of their window recently?"
She was one of the five MPs who voted against the Climate Change Act 2008.
In 2011 she expressed the view that "climate change money should go to armed services".
Over the years,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has expressed her support for a reintroduction of the death penalty, which was abolished in the UK in 1965.
She notably spoke of her support for its reintroduction for the worst cases of murder in the aftermath of the murder of two 10-year-old girls from  <START:person> Soham <END> , Cambridgeshire, in August 2002, in the  <START:person> Soham <END>  murders.
She supported the argument that the death penalty would have deterrent value, as within five years of its abolition the national murder rate had more than doubled.
In government.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  joined  <START:person> John Major <END> 's government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security in 1990.
In 1993, she was moved to the Department of Employment, and she was promoted to Minister of State the following year.
In 1995, she joined the Home Office as Minister of State for Prisons and visited every prison in Britain.
Shadow Cabinet.
After the fall of the Conservative government to Labour in 1997, she served as Shadow Health Secretary between 1998 and 1999 and later as Shadow Home Secretary between 1999 and 2001 under  <START:person> William Hague <END> .
Leadership contest and backbenches.
During the 2001 Conservative leadership election, she could not find sufficient support amongst Conservative MPs for her leadership candidacy.
She first supported  <START:person> Michael Ancram <END> , who was eliminated in the first round, and then  <START:person> Kenneth Clarke <END> , who lost in the final round.
She afterwards declined to serve in  <START:person> Iain Duncan Smith <END> 's Shadow Cabinet (although she indicated on the television programme "When Louis Met...", prior to the leadership contest, that she wished to retire to the backbenches anyway).
In the 2005 leadership election, she initially supported  <START:person> Kenneth Clarke <END>  again.
Once he was eliminated, she turned support towards  <START:person> Liam Fox <END> .
Following  <START:person> Fox <END> 's subsequent elimination, she took time to reflect before finally declaring for  <START:person> David Davis <END> .
She expressed reservations over the eventual winner  <START:person> David Cameron <END> , feeling that he did not, like the other candidates, have a proven track record, and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his A-List policy, which she has said is "an insult to women".
At the October 2006 Conservative Conference, she was Chief Dragon in a political version of the television programme "Dragons' Den", in which A-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal, which was then torn apart by her team of  <START:person> Rachel Elnaugh <END> ,  <START:person> Oliver Letwin <END>  and  <START:person> Michael Brown <END> .
In an interview with "Metro" in September 2006 she stated that if Parliament were of a normal length, it was likely she would retire at the next general election.
She confirmed her intention to stand down to "The Observer"'s Pendennis diary in September 2007, and again in October 2007 after Prime Minister  <START:person> Gordon Brown <END>  quashed speculation of an autumn 2007 general election.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.
When the expenses claims were leaked, however,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was described by "The Daily Telegraph" as one of the "saints" amongst all MPs.
In May 2009, following the resignation of  <START:person> Michael Martin <END>  as Speaker of the House of Commons, it was reported that  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election.
On 11 June 2009, she confirmed her bid to be the Speaker.
She made it through to the second ballot but came last and was eliminated.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  retired from politics at the 2010 general election.
It was rumoured that she would be a Conservative candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner in 2012, but she refused.
She has since spoken about her opposition to the Coalition Government and her surprise at not being given a peerage by  <START:person> David Cameron <END> .
Recognition.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was appointed an Honorary Fellow of Canterbury Christ Church University at a ceremony held at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 January 2009.
Personal life and family.
Until her retirement at the 2010 general election,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  divided her time between her two homes – one in London and one in the village of Sutton Valence, Kent, in her constituency.
She sold both of these properties, however, upon deciding to retire at the next general election.
She shared her home in London with her widowed mother,  <START:person> Rita Widdecombe <END> , until  <START:person> Rita <END> 's death, on 25 April 2007, aged 95.
In March 2008, she purchased a house in Haytor, on Dartmoor in Devon, to where she has now retired.
Her brother,  <START:person> Malcolm <END>  (1937–2010), who was an Anglican Canon in Bristol, retired in May 2009 and died of metastatic oesophageal cancer on 12 October 2010.
Her nephew,  <START:person> Rev Roger Widdecombe <END> , is an Anglican priest.
She has never married nor had any children.
In November 2007 on BBC Radio 4 she described how a journalist once produced a profile on her with the assumption that she had had at least "one sexual relationship", to which  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  replied: "Be careful, that's the way you get sued".
When interviewer  <START:person> Jenni Murray <END>  asked if she had ever had a sexual relationship,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  laughed "it's nobody else's business".
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has a fondness for cats and has a section of her website devoted to all the pet cats with which she has shared her life.
In a recent interview,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  talked about her appreciation of music despite describing herself as "pretty well tone-deaf".
Religious views.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is a practising Catholic.
She converted in 1993 after leaving the Church of England.
Her reasons for leaving the latter were many, as she explained to reporters from the "New Statesman": In 2010,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  turned down an offer to be Britain's next ambassador to the Holy See, being prevented from accepting by suffering a detached retina.
She was made a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope  <START:person> Benedict XVI <END>  for services to politics and public life on 31 January 2013.
Controversies.
In 1990, following the assassination of the Conservative politician  <START:person> Ian Gow <END>  by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Eastbourne by-election for his seat in the House of Commons was won by the Liberal Democrat  <START:person> David Bellotti <END> .
Upon the announcement,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  told the voters that the IRA would be "toasting their success".
In 1996,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END> , as prisons minister, defended the Government's policy to shackle pregnant prisoners with handcuffs and chains when in hospital receiving ante-natal care.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  told the Commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping.
"Some MPs may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape.
Unfortunately this is not true.
The fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners, and since 1990, 20 women have escaped from hospitals".
 <START:person> Jack Straw <END> , Labour's Home Affairs spokesman at the time, said it was "degrading and unnecessary" for a woman to be shackled at any stage .
In 1997, during the Conservative leadership election of  <START:person> William Hague <END> ,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  spoke out against  <START:person> Michael Howard <END> , under whom she had served when he was Home Secretary.
She remarked that "there is something of the night about him".
The remark was considered to be extremely damaging to  <START:person> Howard <END> , who was frequently satirised as a vampire thereafter.
He came last in the poll.
 <START:person> Howard <END>  went on to become party leader in 2003, however, and  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  then stated, "I explained fully what my objections were in 1997 and I do not retract anything I said then.
But this is 2005 and we have to look to the future and not the past."
In 2001, when  <START:person> Michael Portillo <END>  was running for leader of the Conservative Party,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  described him and his allies as "backbiters".
She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.

Following her second appearance,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  vowed she would never appear on the show again because of comments made by panellist  <START:person> Jimmy Carr <END> .
She wrote, "His idea of wit is a barrage of filth and the sort of humour most men grow out of in their teens... [T]here's no amount of money for which I would go through those two recording hours again.
At one stage I nearly walked out."
She did, however, stand by her appraisal of regular panellists  <START:person> Ian Hislop <END>  and  <START:person> Paul Merton <END> , whom she has called "the fastest wits in showbusiness".
In 2007, she awarded the "University Challenge" trophy to the winners.
In the same year, she was cast as herself in "The Sound of Drums", the 12th episode of the third series of the science-fiction drama "Doctor Who" supporting Mr  <START:person> Saxon <END> , the alias of the Master.

In October 2010, she appeared on BBC One's "Strictly Come Dancing", partnered by  <START:person> Anton du Beke <END> , winning the support of some viewers despite low marks from the judges.
After nine weeks of routines strongly flavoured by comedy the couple had received enough support in the public vote to stay in the contest.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was eliminated from the competition on Sunday 5 December after the public vote had been combined with the judges' score; she was with  <START:person> Scott Maslen <END>  of "EastEnders" in the bottom two.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is currently filming a new quiz show with herself as questionmaster, for the Sky Atlantic channel, called "Cleverdicks".
The show is being shown in 30 one-hour episodes in an initial series, starting 2012.

 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is a Patron of the charity Safe Haven for Donkeys in the Holy Land (SHADH) and in 2014 visited the SHADH Donkey Sanctuary in Palestine.
 <START:person> Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie  Antoine Thomson <END>  d'Abbadie d'Arrast (3 January 1810 – 19 March 1897) was a French explorer, geographer, ethnologist, linguist and astronomer notable for his travels in Ethiopia during the first half of the 19th century.
He was the older brother of  <START:person> Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie <END> , with whom he traveled.
Biography.
He was born in the Irish city of Dublin from a partially Basque noble family of the French province of  <START:person> Soule <END> .
His father,  <START:person> Michel Abbadie <END> , was born in Arrast-Larrebieu and his mother was Irish.
His grandfather  <START:person> Jean-Pierre <END>  was an abbot and a notary in Soule.
The family moved to France in 1818 where the brothers received a careful scientific education.
In 1827,  <START:person> Antoine <END>  received a bachelier (bachelor) degree in Toulouse.
Starting in 1829, he began his education in Paris, where he studied law.
He married  <START:person> Virginie Vincent de Saint-Bonnet <END>  on 21 February 1859, and settled in Hendaye where he purchased 250ha to build a castle, and became the mayor of the city from 1871 to 1875.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END>  was a knight of the Legion of Honour, which he received on 27 September 1850, and a member of the French Academy of Sciences.
He died in 1897, and bequeathed the  <START:person> Abbadi <END>  domain and castle in Hendaye, yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences.
Science and explorations.
In 1835 the French Academy sent  <START:person> Antoine <END>  on a scientific mission to Brazil, the results being published at a later date (1873) under the title of "Observations relatives à la physique du globe faites au Brésil et en Éthiopie".
In 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at Massawa in February 1838.
They journeyed throughout Ethiopia, travelling as far south as the Kingdom of Kaffa, sometimes together and sometimes separately.
In addition to his studies in the sciences, he delved into the political fray exerting influence in favor of France and the Roman Catholic missionaries.
While in Ethiopia they returned to France in 1848 with notes on the geography, geology, archaeology, and natural history of the region.
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues.
He was especially attacked by  <START:person> Charles Tilstone Beke <END> , who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to Kana.
But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention—hotly contested by  <START:person> Beke <END> —that the Blue Nile was the main stream.
The topographical results of his explorations were published in Paris between 1860 and 1873 in "Géodésie d'Éthiopie", full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps.
Of the "Géographie de l'Éthiopie" (Paris, 1890) only one volume was published.
In "Un Catalogue raisonné de manuscrits éthiopiens" (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian manuscripts collected by  <START:person> Antoine <END> .
He also compiled various vocabularies, including a "Dictionnaire de la langue amariñña" (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the "Shepherd of Hermas", with the Latin version, in 1860.
He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions.
Under the title of "Reconnaissances magnétiques" he published in 1890 an account of the magnetic observations made by him in the course of several journeys to the Red Sea and the Levant.
The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by  <START:person> Arnaud <END>  in 1868 under the title of " <START:person> Douze <END>  ans dans la Haute Ethiopie".
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  was responsible for streamlining techniques towards geodesy, along with inventing a new theodolite for measuring angles.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END> , a Basque and bascophile.
Basque through his father,  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  developed a particular interest about the Basque Language after meeting the Prince  <START:person> Louis Lucien Bonaparte <END>  in London.
He started his academic work on Basque in 1852.
A speaker of both Souletin and  <START:person> Lapurdian <END> , a resident of Lapurdi,  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  considered himself a Basque from  <START:person> Soule <END> .
The popularity of the motto Zazpiak Bat is attributed to  <START:person> Abbadie <END> .
The castle or château.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END>  gave his castle home the name "Abbadia", which is the name still used in Basque.
However in French it is usually referred to as "Chateau d'Abbadie" or "Domaine d'Abbadia", and locally it is not unusual for it to be called "le Chateau d'Antoine d'Abbadie".
The château was built between 1864 and 1879 on a cliff by the Atlantic Ocean, and was designed by  <START:person> Viollet Le Duc <END>  in the Neo Gothic style, and is considered one of the most important examples of French Gothic Revival Architecture.
It is divided in three parts : the observatory and library, the chapel, and the living quarters.
Nowadays the château still belongs to the Academy of Science to which it was bequeathed in 1895 on condition of its producing a catalogue of half-a-million stars within fifty years' time, with the work to be carried out by members of religious orders.
The château was classified as a protected historical monument by France in 1984.
Most of the château property now belongs to the Coastal Protection Agency, and is managed by the city of Hendaye.
Literary works.
Awards and memberships.
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  received the French Legion of Honor on 27 September 1850 with the order of chevalier or knight.
He was a member of the Bureau des Longitudes and also the French Academy of Sciences.
Both brothers received the grand medal of the Paris Geographical Society in 1850.
Adware  Adware, or advertising-supported software, is any software package that automatically renders advertisements in order to generate revenue for its author.
The advertisements may be in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process.
The functions may be designed to analyze which Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there.
The term is sometimes used to refer to software that displays unwanted advertisements.
Advertising-supported software.
In legitimate software, the advertising functions are integrated into or bundled with the program.
Adware is usually seen by the developer as a way to recover development costs, and in some cases, it may allow the software to be provided to the user free of charge or at a reduced price.
The income derived from presenting advertisements to the user may allow or motivate the developer to continue to develop, maintain and upgrade the software product.
The use of advertising-supported software in business is becoming increasingly popular, with a third of IT and business executives in a 2007 survey by McKinsey & Company planning to be using ad-funded software within the following two years.
Advertisement-funded software is also one of the business models for open-source software.
In application software.
Some software is offered in both an advertising-supported mode and a paid, advertisement-free mode.
The latter is usually available by an online purchase of a license or registration code for the software that unlocks the mode, or the purchase and download of a separate version of the software.
Some software authors offer advertising-supported versions of their software as an alternative option to business organizations seeking to avoid paying large sums for software licenses, funding the development of the software with higher fees for advertisers.
Examples of advertising-supported software include the Windows version of the Internet telephony application Skype, and the Amazon Kindle 3 family of e-book readers, which has versions called "Kindle with Special Offers" that display advertisements on the home page and in sleep mode in exchange for substantially lower pricing.
In 2012, Microsoft and its advertising division, Microsoft Advertising, announced that Windows 8, the forthcoming major release of the Microsoft Windows operating system, would provide built-in methods for software authors to use advertising support as a business model.
The idea had been considered since as early as 2005.
In software as a service.
Support by advertising is a popular business model of software as a service (SaaS) on the Web.
Notable examples include the email service Gmail and other Google Apps products, and the social network Facebook.
Microsoft has also adopted the advertising-supported model for many of its social software SaaS offerings.
The Microsoft Office Live service was also available in an advertising-supported mode.
In the view of Federal Trade Commission staff, there appears to be general agreement that software should be considered "spyware" only if it is downloaded or installed on a computer without the user's knowledge and consent.
However, unresolved issues remain concerning how, what, and when consumers need to be told about software installed on their computers for consent to be adequate.
For instance, distributors often disclose in an end-user license agreement that there is additional software bundled with primary software, but some panelists and commenters did not view such disclosure as sufficient to infer consent to the installation of the bundled software.
As malware.
The term "adware" is frequently used to describe a form of malware (malicious software), usually that which presents unwanted advertisements to the user of a computer.
The advertisements produced by adware are sometimes in the form of a pop-up.
When the term is used in this way, the severity of its implication varies.
While some sources rate adware only as an "irritant", others classify it as an "online threat" or even rate it as seriously as computer viruses and trojans.
The precise definition of the term in this context also varies.
Adware that observes the computer user's activities without their consent and reports it to the software's author is called spyware.
Programs have been developed to detect, quarantine, and remove advertisement-displaying malware, including Ad-Aware, AdwCleaner, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, Spyware Doctor and Spybot Search & Destroy.
In addition, almost all commercial antivirus software currently detect adware and spyware, or offer a separate spyware detection package.
 <START:person> Aedui  Aedui <END> ,  <START:person> Haedui <END>  or Hedui (Ancient Greek: Αἰδούοι), were a Gallic people of  <START:person> Gallia Lugdunensis <END> , who inhabited the country between the Arar (Saône) and  <START:person> Liger <END>  (Loire), in today's France.
Their territory thus included the greater part of the modern departments of Saône-et-Loire, Côte-d'Or and Nièvre.
Geography.
The country of the Aedui is defined by reports of them in ancient writings.
The upper Loire formed their western border, separating them from the Bituriges.
The Saône formed their eastern border, separating them from the Sequani.
The  <START:person> Sequani <END>  did not reside in the region of the confluence of the Doubs into the Saône and of the latter into the Rhône, as  <START:person> Caesar <END>  says that the Helvetii, following the pass between the Jura Mountains and the Rhône southwards, which belonged to the Sequani, plundered the territory of the Aedui.
These circumstances explain an apparent contradiction in  <START:person> Strabo <END> , who in one sentence says that the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  lived between the Saône and the Doubs, and in the next, that the  <START:person> Sequani <END>  lived across the Saône (eastward).
Both statements are true, the first in the south, and the second to the north.
History.
According to  <START:person> Livy <END>  (v.
34), they took part in the expedition of Bellovesus into Italy in the 6th century BC.
Before  <START:person> Caesar <END> 's time, they had attached themselves to the Romans, and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the Roman people.
When the Sequani, their hereditary rivals, with the assistance of a Germanic chieftain named Ariovistus, defeated and massacred the Aedui at the Battle of Magetobriga, the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  sent  <START:person> Diviciacus <END> , the druid, to Rome to appeal to the senate for help.
But his mission was unsuccessful.
On his arrival in  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (58 BC),  <START:person> Caesar <END>  restored their independence.
In spite of this, the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  joined the Gallic coalition against  <START:person> Caesar <END>  ("B.
G." vii.
42), but after the surrender of Vercingetorix at Alesia, were glad to return to their allegiance.
 <START:person> Augustus <END>  dismantled their native capital Bibracte on  <START:person> Mont Beuvray <END> , and substituted a new town with a half-Roman, half-Gaulish name,  <START:person> Augustodunum <END>  (modern Autun).
In 21, during the reign of  <START:person> Tiberius <END> , they revolted under  <START:person> Julius Sacrovir <END> , and seized Augustodunum, but were soon put down by  <START:person> Gaius Silius <END>  (Tacitus "Ann."
iii.
43-46).
The Aedui were the first of the Gauls to receive from the emperor  <START:person> Claudius <END>  the distinction of "jus honorum"; thus being the first Gauls permitted to become senators.
The oration of Eumenius, in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place Augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected.
The chief magistrate of the Aedui in  <START:person> Caesar <END> 's time was called Vergobretus (according to  <START:person> Mommsen <END> , "judgment-worker"), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death, but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier.
Certain clientes, or small communities, were also dependent upon the Aedui.
It is possible that the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  adopted many of the governmental practices of the Romans, such as electing magistrates and other officials.
Or perhaps this was a natural development in their political system.
It is thought that other Celtic tribes, such as the Remi and the Baiocasses, also elected their leaders.
Bibliography.
<br>   <START:person> Aelia Capitolina  Aelia Capitolina <END>  (; Latin in full: "COLONIA ÆLIA CAPITOLINA") was a Roman colony, built under the emperor  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  on the site of Jerusalem, which was in ruins since the siege of 70 AD, leading in part to the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136.
Foundation.
Jerusalem was still in ruins from the First Jewish–Roman War in 70.
 <START:person> Josephus <END>  – a contemporary historian and hagiographer who was born in Jerusalem and fought the Romans in that war – reports that "Jerusalem ... was so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations, that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once been a place of habitation."
When the Roman Emperor  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  vowed to rebuild Jerusalem from the wreckage in 130, he considered reconstructing Jerusalem as a gift to the Jewish people.
The Jews awaited with hope, but then after  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  visited Jerusalem, he was told that rebuilding the Second Temple would encourage sedition.
He then decided to rebuild the city as a Roman colony which would be inhabited by his legionaries.
 <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's new plans included temples to the major regional deities, and certain Roman gods, in particular Jupiter Capitolinus.
The Jewish Bar Kokhba revolt, which took the Romans three years to suppress, enraged  <START:person> Hadrian <END> , and he came to be determined to erase Judaism from the province.
Circumcision was forbidden, Iudaea province was renamed Syria Palaestina and Jews (formally all circumcised men) were banned from entering the city on pain of death.
Christianity.
According to Eusebius, the Jerusalem church was scattered twice, in 70 and 135, with the difference that from 70-130 the bishops of Jerusalem have evidently Jewish names, whereas after 135 the bishops of  <START:person> Aelia Capitolina <END>  appear to be Greeks.
Eusebius' evidence for continuation of a church at Aelia Capitolina is confirmed by the Bordeaux Pilgrim.
Name.
"Aelia" came from  <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's "nomen gentile", "Aelius", while "Capitolina" meant that the new city was dedicated to "Jupiter Capitolinus", to whom a temple was built on the site of the former Jewish temple, the Temple Mount.
The Latin name "Aelia" is the source of the Arabic term  <START:person> Iliyā <END> ' (إلياء), an early Islamic name for Jerusalem.
Plan of the city.
The city was without walls, protected by a light garrison of the Tenth Legion, during the Late Roman Period.
The detachment at Jerusalem, which apparently encamped all over the city’s western hill, was responsible for preventing Jews from returning to the city.
Roman enforcement of this prohibition continued through the 4th century.
The urban plan of  <START:person> Aelia Capitolina <END>  was that of a typical Roman town wherein main thoroughfares crisscrossed the urban grid lengthwise and widthwise.
The urban grid was based on the usual central north-south road ("cardo") and central east-west route ("decumanus").
However, as the main cardo ran up the western hill, and the Temple Mount blocked the eastward route of the main decumanus, a second pair of main roads was added; the secondary cardo ran down the Tyropoeon Valley, and the secondary decumanus ran just to the north of the Temple Mount.
The main Hadrianic cardo terminated not far beyond its junction with the decumanus, where it reached the Roman garrison's encampment, but in the Byzantine era it was extended over the former camp to reach the southern walls of the city.
The two cardines converged near the "Damascus Gate", and a semicircular piazza covered the remaining space; in the piazza a columnar monument was constructed, hence the Arabic name for the gate "Bab el-Amud" ("Gate of the Column").
Tetrapylones were constructed at the other junctions between the main roads.
This street pattern has been preserved in the Old City of Jerusalem to the present.
The original thoroughfare, flanked by rows of columns and shops, was about 73 feet (22 meters) wide, but buildings have extended onto the streets over the centuries, and the modern lanes replacing the ancient grid are now quite narrow.
The substantial remains of the western cardo have now been exposed to view near the junction with Suq el-Bazaar, and remnants of one of the tetrapylones are preserved in the 19th century Franciscan chapel at the junction of the Via Dolorosa and Suq Khan ez-Zeit.
As was standard for new Roman cities,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  placed the city's main Forum at the junction of the main cardo and decumanus, now the location for the (smaller) Muristan.
Adjacent to the Forum, at the junction of the same cardo, and the other decumanus,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  built a large temple to  <START:person> Venus <END> , which later became the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; despite 11th century destruction, which resulted in the modern Church having a much smaller footprint, several boundary walls of  <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's temple have been found among the archaeological remains beneath the Church.
The "Struthion Pool" lay in the path of the northern decumanus, so  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  placed vaulting over it, added a large pavement on top, and turned it into a secondary Forum; the pavement can still be seen under the Convent of the Sisters of Zion.
Afghan Turkestan  Afghan Turkestan is a region in northern Afghanistan, on the border with the former Soviet republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
In the 19th century there was a province in Afghanistan named Turkestan Province until abolished by  <START:person> Abdur Rahman <END> , and was centred on  <START:person> Mazari Sharif <END>  and included territory in the modern provinces of Balkh, Jowzjan, Faryab and Sar-e Pol.
The whole territory, from the junction of the Kokcha river with the Amu Darya on the north-east to the province of Herat on the south-west, was some 500 mi in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the Hindu Kush of 114 miles (183 km).
It thus comprised about 57,000 sqmi or roughly two-ninths of the former Kingdom of Afghanistan.
Geography.
The area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the Karakum Desert.
Population.
The bulk of the people are Uzbek and Turkmen with large concentrations of Tajik, Hazara and Pashtuns.
History.
Ancient Balkh or Bactria was an integral part of Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex, and was occupied by Indo-Iranians.
In the 5th century BCE, it became a province of the Achaemenian Empire and later became part of the Seleucid Empire.
About 250 BC Diodotus (Theodotus), governor of Bactria under the Seleucidae, declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to Parthian and nomadic movements about 126 BC.
After this came a Buddhist era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak.
The district was devastated by  <START:person> Genghis Khan <END> , and has never since fully recovered its prosperity.
For about a century it belonged to the Delhi empire, and then fell into Uzbek hands.
In the 18th century it formed part of the dominion of  <START:person> Ahmad Khan Durrani <END> , and so remained under his son  <START:person> Timur <END> .
But under the fratricidal wars of  <START:person> Timur <END> 's sons the separate khanates fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbek chiefs.
At the beginning of the 19th century they belonged to Bukhara; but under the emir  <START:person> Dost Mahommed <END>  the Afghans recovered Balkh and Tashkurgan in 1850,  <START:person> Akcha <END>  and the four western khanates in 1855, and Kunduz in 1859.
The sovereignty over Andkhui, Shibarghan,  <START:person> Saripul <END>  and Maimana was in dispute between Bukhara and Kabul until settled by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 in favour of the Afghan claim.
Under the strong rule of  <START:person> Abdur Rahman <END>  these outlying territories were closely welded to Kabul; but after the accession of  <START:person> Habibullah <END>  the bonds once more relaxed.
In 1890 the district of Qataghan and Badakhshan was divided from Afghan Turkestan and made into the Qataghan-Badakhshan Province.
Administration of the province was assigned to the Northern Bureau in Kabul.
Afyonkarahisar  Afyonkarahisar (], Turkish: "afyon" "poppy, opium", 'kara' "black", 'hisar' "fortress") is a city in western Turkey, the capital of Afyon Province.
Afyon is in mountainous countryside inland from the Aegean coast, 250 km south-west of Ankara along the Akarçay River.
Elevation 1021 m.
Population (2010 census) 173,100  Etymology.
The name Afyon  <START:person> Kara Hisar <END>  (literally "opium black castle" in Turkish), since opium was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock.
Also known simply as Afyon.
Older spellings include  <START:person> Karahisar-i Sahip <END> , Afium-Kara-hissar and Afyon Karahisar.
The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the Turkish Parliament in 2004.
History.
The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time.
It was known to the Hittites as  <START:person> Hapanuwa <END> , and was later occupied by Phrygians, Lydians and Achaemenid Persians until it was conquered by  <START:person> Alexander the Great <END> .
After the death of  <START:person> Alexander <END>  the city (now known as Akroinοn (Ακροϊνόν) or Nikopolis (Νικόπολις) in Ancient Greek), was ruled by the Seleucids and the kings of Pergamon, then Rome and Byzantium.
The Byzantine emperor  <START:person> Leo III <END>  after his victory over Arab besiegers in 740 renamed the city Nicopolis (Greek for "city of victory").
The Seljuq Turks then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to  <START:person> Kara Hissar <END>  ("black castle") after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201 meters above the town.
Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the Sâhib Ata and then the Germiyanids.
The castle was much fought over during the Crusades and was finally conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Beyazid I in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of  <START:person> Timur Lenk <END>  in 1402.
It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.
The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city with the typical Ottoman urban mixture of Turks and Armenians.
During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock.
During the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) campaign (part of the Turkish War of Independence) Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by French, Italian and then Greek forces.
However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region.
After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.
The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name "Afyon") until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.
Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime.
They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the poppy straw method of extraction.
Afyon was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 50 lira banknote of 1927-1938.
Climate.
Afyonkarahisar has a continental climate (Köppen climate classification: "Dsa" and "Dsb"), with cold and snowy winters and warm to hot and dry summers.
Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn.
Afyon today.
Afyon is the centre of an agricultural area and the city has a country town feel to it.
There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey.
However Afyon Kocatepe University opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.
Nowadays Afyon is known for its marble (in 2005 there were 355 marble quarries in the province of Afyon producing high quality white stone), its "sucuk" (spiced sausages), its "kaymak" (meaning either "cream" or a white Turkish Delight) and various handmade weavings.
There is also a large cement factory.
This is a natural crossroads, the routes from Ankara to İzmir and from Istanbul to Antalya intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys.
There are a number of well-established roadside restaurants for travellers to breakfast on the local cuisine.
Some of these places are modern well-equipped hotels and spas; the mineral waters of Afyon are renowned for their healing qualities.
There is also a long string of roadside kiosks selling the local Turkish delight.
Transport.
Afyon is also an important rail junction between İzmir, Konya, Ankara and Istanbul.
Afyon is on the route of the planned high-speed rail line between Ankara and Izmir.

Atari Jaguar  The Atari Jaguar is a fifth generation home video game console that was developed by Atari Corporation.
The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the Atari brand, originally released in North America in November 1993.
Marketed by  <START:person> Atari <END>  as the first 64-bit video game console, the Jaguar was designed to compete with the 16-bit Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform.
Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 90s, and was designed by Flare Technology, who were tasked by Atari to create two consoles; the Atari Panther, which would compete with the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo, and a successor, the Jaguar, which would surpass the capabilities of any other console on the market at the time.
With development of the Jaguar running ahead of schedule, the Panther was cancelled, and the release of the Jaguar was pushed forward.
It was originally released to test markets in New York City and San Francisco in November 1993, and to the general public in 1994.
Upon release, it was initially criticized for its complex controller design and the console's failure to distinguish itself from its 16-bit competitors.
It was also criticized for its low quality game library, with poorly received games such as "Cybermorph" and "Kasumi Ninja" gaining more publicity than other titles on the system.
The console's multi-chip architecture, making game development for the console difficult, and underwhelming sales contributed to the console's lack of third party support.
This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a limited game library, comprising only 67 licensed titles.
Some games for the system, however, such as "Alien vs Predator", "Tempest 2000" and ports of id Software's "Wolfenstein 3D" and "Doom", are well received by contemporary critics.
Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the Jaguar with a CD-ROM add-on known as the Atari Jaguar CD, though, with the release of the Sega Saturn and Sony's PlayStation in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was eventually discontinued in 1996.
The Jaguar was deemed a commercial failure, and prompted Atari to leave the home video game console market.
After Hasbro Interactive bought out Atari in the late 1990s, the rights to the Jaguar were released into the public domain, with the console being declared an open platform.
Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces homebrew games for the console.
Notable homebrew titles for the Jaguar include "Skyhammer" and "BattleSphere".
Development.
The Jaguar was developed by the members of Flare Technology, a company formed by  <START:person> Martin Brennan <END>  and  <START:person> John Mathieson <END> .
The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the Sega Genesis or the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but they could also be cost-effective.
Impressed by their work on the Konix Multisystem, Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called Flare II, with Atari providing the funding.
Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari Corp.
One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed "Panther"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed "Jaguar"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari Corp. canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.
Reception.
The Jaguar was introduced in 1993 at a price of $249.99,
under a $500 million manufacturing deal with IBM.
The system was initially marketed only in the New York City and the San Francisco Bay areas, under the slogan "Do the Math", claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems.
A US-wide release followed in early 1994.
The Atari Jaguar struggled to attain a substantial user base.
In 1993, Atari reported that they had shipped 17,000 units as part of the system's initial test market.
By the end of 1994, Atari reported that they had sold approximately 100,000 systems and had reduced the price to improve the competitive nature of the console.
By the end of 1995, Sony and Sega had entered the marketplace with competing consoles and Atari's sales declined rapidly.
In Atari's 1995 annual report, they noted: "Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit.
Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively."
Jaguar did earn praise with titles such as "Tempest 2000", "Doom", and "Wolfenstein 3D".
The most successful title during the Jaguar's first year was "Alien vs. Predator".
Both it and "Tempest 2000" were named among the system's defining titles by "GamePro" in 2007.
With such a small library of games to challenge the incumbent 16-bit game consoles, Jaguar's appeal never grew beyond a small gaming audience.
In 2006 IGN editor  <START:person> Craig Harris <END>  rated the Jaguar controller as the worst ever, criticizing the complexity of the "phone keypad".
A version that has six action buttons, the Pro Controller, is suggested for certain games.
Lack of titles was attributable to two main factors: the Jaguar's questionable long-term prospects among third-party game-publishers and the problematic nature of developing games for the Jaguar.
Atari had one opportunity to convince third-party developers, vital for the diversity of Jaguar's game library, with a solid retail-performance, but as things played out, post-holiday sales figures questioned the viability of Atari's business; Atari failed to attract many third-party developers already committed to other game platforms.
In addition, the Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's memory controller, which prevented code execution out of system RAM.
Less severe, but still annoying defects included a buggy UART.
The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code.
Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete.
Writing game-code was often an endurance exercise in the tedious assembler.
In a July 1995 interview with "Next Generation", then-CEO  <START:person> Sam Tramiel <END>  declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the Sega Saturn, and slightly weaker than the PlayStation.
By the end of 1995, Atari's revenues declined by more than half, from US$38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995.<ref name="10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996"></ref> In late 1995, Atari Corp. ran early-morning infomercial advertisements with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system.
The infomercials ran most of the year, but did not significantly sell the remaining stock of Jaguar systems.
In its 10-K405 SEC Filing, filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders of the truly dire nature of the Jaguar business: From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar.
As of December 31, 1995, Atari had approximately 100,000 units of Jaguar in inventory.
Atari had already suffered an ill-fated crash in the mid-1980s as a result of the oversaturation of the video game market by third-party developers.
Production of the Jaguar ceased after Atari Corp. merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover.
In a last-ditch effort to revive the Jaguar, Atari Corp. tried to play down the other two consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only "64-bit" system.
This claim is questioned by some, because the CPU (68000) and GPU executed a 32-bit instruction-set, but sent control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors (or "graphics accelerators").
Atari Corp.'s reasoning that the 32-bit "Tom" and " <START:person> Jerry <END> " chips work in tandem to add up to a 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by "Electronic Gaming Monthly", which commented that "If Sega did the math for the Sega Saturn the way Atari did the math for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine."
Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs.
In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic.
Over the short life of the console, several add-on peripherals were announced.
Even prior to the console's test market launch, Atari had promised a CD-based add-on console, a dial-up internet link with support for online gaming, a virtual reality headset, and an MPEG-2 video card.
However, only the ProController, the Atari Jaguar CD drive, and the JagLink (a simple two-console networking device) reached retail shelves.
A voice modem and virtual reality headset (with infrared head-tracking) existed in prototype form, but were never commercialized (see  <START:person> Loki <END>  and Konix Multisystem for early development).
Reviewing the Jaguar just a few weeks prior to its launch, "GamePro" gave it a "thumbs sideways".
They praised the power of the hardware but criticized the controller, and were dubious of how the software lineup would turn out, commenting that Atari's failure to secure support from key third party publishers such as Capcom was a bad sign.
They concluded that "Like the 3DO, the Jaguar is a risky investment just not quite as expensive."
Legacy.
After the Atari Corporation properties were bought out by Hasbro Interactive in the late 1990s, Hasbro released the rights to the Jaguar, declaring the console an open platform and opening the doors for homebrew development.
A few developers, including Telegames and Songbird Productions, have not only released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past, but also several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following.
In the United Kingdom in 2001, a deal was struck between Telegames and retailer Game to bring the Jaguar to Game's retail outlets.
The machine was initially sold for £29.99 brand new and the software was ranged between £9.99 for more common games such as "Doom" and "Ruiner Pinball", and up to £39.99 for more sought-after releases such as "Defender 2000" and "Checkered Flag".
The machine had a presence in the stores until 2007 when remaining consoles were sold off for £9.99 and games were sold for as low as 97p.
This deal was seen as a move to remain competitive with Game's rival at the time, Gamestation, who were well known for stocking retro formats.
Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, has since purchased the molding plates for the Jaguar's casing as with minor modification they were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera.
The game cartridge molds were reused to create an optional memory expansion card.
In 2015, the molds for the console and cartridges were purchased from Imagin Systems by  <START:person> Mike Kennedy <END> , owner of the "Game Gavel" video game auction website and "Retro Magazine", a Kickstarter funded print and digital retro video game magazine, to manufacture shells for a brand new,  <START:person> Kickstarter <END>  funded, cartridge-based video game console, called the "Retro VGS" (Retro Video Game System).
The purchase of the molds from Imagin Systems was far cheaper than designing and manufacturing entirely new molds, and  <START:person> Kennedy <END>  described their acquisition as "the entire reason [the Retro VGS] is possible".
The Jaguar continues to have a small and dedicated game development circle.
Technical specifications.
From the Jaguar Software Reference manual, page 1: Jaguar is a custom chip set primarily intended to be the heart of a very high-performance games/leisure computer.
It may also be used as a graphics accelerator in more complex systems, and applied to workstation and business uses.
As well as a general purpose CPU, Jaguar contains four processing units.
These are the Object Processor, Graphics Processor,  <START:person> Blitter <END> , and Digital Sound Processor.
Jaguar provides these blocks with a 64-bit data path to external memory devices, and is capable of a very high data transfer rate into external dynamic RAM.
Accessories.
Atari Jaguar CD.
The Atari Jaguar CD or Jag CD is a CD-ROM peripheral that sat on top the Atari Jaguar video game console and plugged in through the cartridge slot.
Memory Track.
Released in 1995, the Atari Jaguar CD "Memory Track" is a cartridge that contains a 128 K EEPROM, allowing Atari Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and saved games.
The Memory Track Program Manager is accessed by pushing the option button while the system is starting, and exited by pushing the * and # keys simultaneously.
Team Tap.
The Atari Jaguar "Team Tap" is a multi-player adapter for use on certain Jaguar games.
It was available by itself, or as a pack-in with the four player game "White Men Can't Jump".
Each Team Tap supports up to 4 players; by plugging Team Taps into both Jaguar controller ports, up to 8 players are supported.
The only games compatible with the Team Tap are "White Men Can't Jump" and "NBA Jam Tournament Edition".
Jaglink Interface.
The Atari Jaguar "Jaglink Interface" enables players to hook two Atari Jaguars connected to two TVs together with a phone cable, allowing multiplayer gaming on two separate screens.
The only games to support this add-on are "DOOM", "BattleSphere", and "AirCars".
The Jaglink is also used to connect the Jaguar to a PC for game development using the JUGS DD (Jaguar Unmodified Game Server Dev Disc) dev system disk for Jaguar CD that was included in "BattleSphere Gold", which also came with the "JUGS Device" (a DB9 to phone cord adapter) to connect a PC to a Jaguar via Jaglink.
Jaglink is also compatible with ICD's CatBox.
 <START:person> Jaglink <END>  came in sets of two.
Atari Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge.
The Atari Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge from B&C Computervisions allows players to boot unencrypted discs on an Atari Jaguar CD system.
CatBox by ICD.
The "CatBox" is an unofficial expansion peripheral for the Atari Jaguar released by the Rockford, Illinois company ICD.
It was originally slated to be released early in the Jaguar's life, in the second quarter of 1994, but was not actually released until 1996.
The ICD CatBox plugs directly into the AV/DSP connectors located in the rear of the Jaguar console and provides three main functions.
These are audio, video, and communications.
It features six output formats, three for audio (line level stereo, RGB monitor, headphone jack with volume control) and three for video (composite, S-Video, and RGB analog component video) making the Jaguar compatible with multiple high quality monitor systems and multiple monitors at the same time.
It is capable of communications methods known as CatNet and RS-232 as well as DSP pass through, allowing the user to connect two or more Jaguars together for multi player games either directly or with modems.
The ICD CatBox features a polished steel casing and red LEDs in the jaguar's eyes on the logo that indicate communications activity.
An IBM AT type null modem cable may be used to connect two Jaguars together.
The CatBox is also compatible with Atari's Jaglink Interface peripheral.
Atari Jaguar VR Headset Prototype.
Atari developed several Virtual Reality headset prototypes for the Jaguar.
There were two models, a blue and grey high resolution unit, and a red and grey low resolution unit.
After Atari merged with JTS in 1996, most of the headsets were reportedly destroyed, but not all of them.
Supposedly, there are only two working units known to be left in existence.
The only game released that was compatible with the Atari Jaguar VR Headset was Missile Command 3D.
Atari Jaguar Cortina Web TV Adapter Prototype.
An adaptor for the Jaguar that allows for WebTV access was revealed in 1998, one prototype is known to exist.
Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator a.k.a.
Jaguar Voice Modem (JVM) Prototype.
In 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it partnered up with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator.
The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled all together, but not before an estimated 100 or so were made.
The JVM as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers.
Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play.
The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is  <START:person> Ultra Vortek <END> , the modem is initialized in the Ultra Vortek start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.
COJAG Arcade Games.
Atari Games licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games.
The system, named COJAG (for "Coin-Op Jaguar"), replaced the 68000 with a 68020 or MIPS R3000-based CPU (depending on the board version), and added a hard drive and more RAM.
It ran the lightgun games "Area 51" and "Maximum Force", which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine.
Other games ("3 On 3 Basketball"; "Fishin' Frenzy"; "Freeze"; "Vicious Circle") were developed but never released.
Atari Jaguar Duo.
The Atari Jaguar Duo was a proposed console similar to the Sega Neptune.
It was an attempt by Atari to combine the Atari Jaguar and Atari Jaguar CD to make a new console.
It was never completed and was thus never released.
After cancelling the console, Atari was bought by Hasbro and ceased all console development.
Australian Army  The Australian Army is Australia's military land force.
It is part of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) along with the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force.
While the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) commands the ADF, the Army is commanded by the Chief of Army (CA).
The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the Minister for Defence.
Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, only in World War II has Australian territory come under direct attack.
History.
The history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods: During its history the Australian Army has fought in a number of major wars, including: Second Boer War (1899–1902), First World War (1914–18), the Second World War (1939–45), Korea War (1950–53), Malayan Emergency (1950–60), Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation (1962–66), Vietnam War (1962–73), and more recently in Afghanistan (2001 – present) and Iraq (2003–2009).
Since 1947 the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations, however the non United Nations sponsored Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai is a notable exception.
Australia's largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 in East Timor, while other ongoing operations include peacekeeping on Bougainville, in the Sinai, and in the Solomon Islands.
Humanitarian relief after 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake in Aceh Province, Indonesia, Operation Sumatra Assist, ended on 24 March 2005.
Current organisation.
The 1st Division comprises a deployable headquarters, while 2nd Division under the command of Forces Command is the main home-defence formation, containing Army Reserve units.
2nd Division's headquarters only performs administrative functions.
The Australian Army has not deployed a divisional-sized formation since 1945 and does not expect to do so in the future.
1st Division.
1st Division carries out high-level training activities and deploys to command large-scale ground operations.
It does not have any combat units permanently assigned.
Forces Command.
Forces Command controls for administrative purposes all non-special-forces assets of the Australian Army.
It is neither an operational nor a deployable command.
Additionally, Forces Command includes the following training establishments: Special Forces.
Special Operations Command comprises a command formation of equal status to the other commands in the ADF.
It is a brigade-sized formation responsible for all of Australia's special-forces assets.
Planned restructuring.
Under a restructuring program known as Plan Beersheba announced in late 2011, the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades will be re-formed as combined-arms multi-role manoeuvre brigades with the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (part of the 3rd Brigade) forming the core of a future amphibious force The force will be known as an Amphibious Ready Element and will utilise the former Royal Navy 16,000-tonne auxiliary Bay class landing ship RFA Largs Bay (L3006), bought for $100 million to become HMAS Choules.
Colours, standards and guidons.
Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as "the Colours".
Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units.
The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units.
Artillery units' guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect.
Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units.
As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners.
Units awarded battle honours have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons.
They are a link to the unit's past and a memorial to the fallen.
Artillery do not have Battle Honours – their single Honour is "Ubique" which means "Everywhere" – although they can received Honour Titles.
The Army is the guardian of the National Flag and as such, unlike the Royal Australian Air Force, does not have a flag or Colours.
The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner.
To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General Sir  <START:person> William Deane <END> , presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the Australian War Memorial on 10 March 2001.
The Banner was presented to the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A), Warrant Officer  <START:person> Peter Rosemond <END> .
The Army Banner bears the Australian Coat of Arms on the obverse, with the dates "1901–2001" in gold in the upper hoist.
The reverse bears the "rising sun" badge of the Australian Army, flanked by seven campaign honours on small gold-edged scrolls: South Africa, World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya-Borneo, South Vietnam, and Peacekeeping.
The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.
Personnel.
Strength.
In the 2010–11 financial year the Army had an average strength of 47,135 personnel: 30,235 permanent (regular) and 16,900 active reservists (part-time).
In addition there are another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.
The regular Army is targeted to expand to 31,000 personnel by 2014–15.
Personnel numbers have trended downwards since a peak in 2010–11 with an actual strength of 28,568 full-time personnel.
Army Reserve numbers are 14,662, which does not include Standby Reserves.
This gives the Army a combined strength of 43,230 active personnel for the year 2013–14.
Rank and insignia.
The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the British Army, and carry mostly the same actual insignia.
For officers the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title "Australia".
The Non-Commissioned Officer insignia are the same up until Warrant Officer ranks, where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).
The ranks of the Australian Army are as follows: Bases.
The Army's operational headquarters, Forces Command, is located at Victoria Barracks in Sydney.
The Australian Army's three regular brigades are based at Robertson Barracks near Darwin, Lavarack Barracks in Townsville and Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane.
The Deployable Joint Force Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks.
Other important Army bases include the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey, Queensland, Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney, Lone Pine Barracks in Singleton, New South Wales and Woodside Barracks near Adelaide, South Australia.
The SASR is based at Campbell Barracks Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.
Puckapunyal north of Melbourne houses the Australian Army's Combined Arms Training Centre, Land Warfare Development Centre, and three of the five principal Combat Arms schools.
Further barracks include Steele Barracks in Sydney, Keswick Barracks in Adelaide, and Irwin Barracks at Karrakatta in Perth.
Dozens of Australian Army Reserve depots are located across Australia.

Antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through the fundamental theorem of calculus: the definite integral of a function over an interval is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.
The discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is antidifference.
Example.
The function "F"("x") = "x"3/3 is an antiderivative of "f"("x") = "x"2.
As the derivative of a constant is zero, "x"2 will have an infinite number of antiderivatives; such as "x"3/3, "x"3/3 + 1, "x"3/3 - 2, etc.
Thus, all the antiderivatives of "x"2 can be obtained by changing the value of C in "F"("x") = "x"3/3 + "C"; where "C" is an arbitrary constant known as the constant of integration.
Essentially, the graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are vertical translations of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the value of "C".
In physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant.
The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity because the derivative of a constant term is zero.
This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on).
Uses and properties.
Antiderivatives are important because they can be used to compute definite integrals, using the fundamental theorem of calculus: if "F" is an antiderivative of the integrable function "f" and "f" is continuous over the interval ["a", "b"], then: Because of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function "f" is sometimes called the "general integral" or "indefinite integral" of "f" and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds: If "F" is an antiderivative of "f", and the function "f" is defined on some interval, then every other antiderivative "G" of "f" differs from "F" by a constant: there exists a number "C" such that "G"("x") = "F"("x") + "C" for all "x".
"C" is called the arbitrary constant of integration.
If the domain of "F" is a disjoint union of two or more intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals.
For instance is the most general antiderivative of formula_4 on its natural domain formula_5 Every continuous function "f" has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative "F" is given by the definite integral of "f" with variable upper boundary: Varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives).
This is another formulation of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
There are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions (like polynomials, exponential functions, logarithms, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions and their combinations).
Examples of these are  "From left to right, the first four are the error function, the Fresnel function, the trigonometric integral, and the logarithmic integral function."
See also Differential  <START:person> Galois <END>  theory for a more detailed discussion.
Techniques of integration.
Finding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives.
For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions.
See the article on elementary functions for further information.
There are various methods available: Antiderivatives of non-continuous functions.
Non-continuous functions can have antiderivatives.
While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that: Assuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals: on the closed interval ["a", "b"].
Then "g" must have either a maximum or minimum "c" in the open interval ("a", "b") and so   Antigonid dynasty  The Antigonid dynasty (; Greek: Ἀντιγονίδαι) was a dynasty of Hellenistic kings descended from  <START:person> Alexander the Great <END> 's general  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  I Monophthalmus ("the One-eyed").
History.
Succeeding the Antipatrid dynasty in much of Macedonia,  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria.
His attempts to take control of the whole of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's empire led to his defeat and death at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC.
 <START:person> Antigonus <END> 's son  <START:person> Demetrius <END>  I Poliorcetes survived the battle, and managed to seize control of Macedon itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying as a prisoner of Seleucus I Nicator.
After a period of confusion,  <START:person> Demetrius <END> 's son  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  II Gonatas was able to establish the family's control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states, by 276 BC.
Legacy.
It was one of four dynasties established by  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's successors, the others being the Seleucid dynasty, Ptolemaic dynasty and Attalid dynasty.
The last scion of the dynasty,  <START:person> Perseus <END>  of  <START:person> Macedon <END> , who reigned between 179-168 BC, proved unable to stop the advancing Roman legions and  <START:person> Macedon <END> 's defeat at the Battle of Pydna signaled the end of the dynasty.
Dynasty.
The ruling members of the Antigonid dynasty were: The Greek rebel against Rome and last King of Macedonia,  <START:person> Andriscus <END> , claimed to be the son of Perseus.
File archiver  A file archiver is a computer program that combines a number of files together into one archive file, or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage.
File archivers may employ lossless data compression in their archive formats to reduce the size of the archive.
Basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives.
The archive files need to store metadata, at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible.
More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the original timestamps, file attributes or access control lists.
The process of making an archive file is called "archiving" or "packing".
Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed "unarchiving", "unpacking" or "extracting".
Unix archivers.
The Unix tools "ar", "tar", "cpio" act as archivers but not compressors.
Users of the Unix tools use additional compression tools, such as gzip, bzip2, or xz, to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file.
The filename extensions are successively added at each step of this process.
For example, archiving a collection of files with "tar" and then compressing the resulting archive file with "gzip" results a file with codice_1 extension.
This approach has two goals: This approach, however, has disadvantages too: Windows archives.
The built-in archiver of Microsoft Windows as well as third-party archiving software, such as WinZip, WinRAR and 7-zip, often use a graphical user interface.
The last three also offer an optional command-line interface but Windows itself does not.
Windows archivers perform both archiving and compression.
Solid compression may or may not be offered, depending on the product: Windows itself does not support it; WinRAR and 7-zip offer it as an option that can be turned on or off.
Artemis  Artemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities.
Her Roman equivalent is  <START:person> Diana <END> .
Some scholars believe that the name, and indeed the goddess herself, was originally pre-Greek.
Homer refers to her as "Artemis Agrotera, Potnia Theron": "Artemis of the wildland, Mistress of Animals".
The Arcadians believed she was the daughter of Demeter.
In the classical period of Greek mythology, Artemis (Ancient Greek: Ἄρτεμις, ] in Classical Attic) was often described as the daughter of Zeus and  <START:person> Leto <END> , and the twin sister of Apollo.
She was the Hellenic goddess of the hunt, wild animals, wilderness, childbirth, virginity and protector of young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows.
The deer and the cypress were sacred to her.
In later Hellenistic times, she even assumed the ancient role of Eileithyia in aiding childbirth.
Etymology.
The name Artemis ("noun", "feminine") is of unknown or uncertain origin and etymology although various ones have been proposed.
For example according to  <START:person> Jablonski <END> , the name is also Phrygian and could be "compared with the royal appellation "Artemas" of  <START:person> Xenophon <END> .
According to  <START:person> Charles Anthon <END>  the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from *"arta", *"art", *"arte", all meaning "great, excellent, holy," thus Artemis "becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus".
 <START:person> Anton Goebel <END>  "suggests the root στρατ or ῥατ, "to shake," and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter".
 <START:person> Babiniotis <END>  while accepting that the etymology is unknown, states that the name is already attested in Mycenean Greek and is possibly of pre-Hellenic origin.
The name could also be possibly related to Greek "árktos" "bear" (from PIE *"h₂ŕ̥tḱos"), supported by the bear cult that the goddess had in Attica (Brauronia) and the Neolithic remains at the Arkoudiotissa Cave, as well as the story about  <START:person> Callisto <END> , which was originally about Artemis (Arcadian epithet "kallisto"); this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger bear cult found further afield in other Indo-European cultures (e.g.,  <START:person> Gaulish Artio <END> ).
It is believed that a precursor of Artemis was worshiped in Minoan Crete as the goddess of mountains and hunting, Britomartis.
While connection with Anatolian names has been suggested, the earliest attested forms of the name "Artemis" are the Mycenaean Greek 𐀀𐀳𐀖𐀵, "a-te-mi-to" /Artemitos/ and 𐀀𐀴𐀖𐀳, "a-ti-mi-te" /Artimitei/, written in Linear B at Pylos.
 <START:person> R. S. P. Beekes <END>  suggested that the "e"/"i" interchange points to a Pre-Greek origin.
Artemis was venerated in  <START:person> Lydia <END>  as "Artimus".
Ancient Greek writers, by way of folk etymology, and some modern scholars, have linked Artemis (Doric "Artamis") to ἄρταμος, "artamos", i.e. "butcher" or, like  <START:person> Plato <END>  did in "Cratylus", to ἀρτεμής, "artemḗs", i.e. "safe", "unharmed", "uninjured", "pure", "the stainless maiden".
Artemis in mythology.
<poem>  <START:person> Leto <END>  bore Apollon and Artemis, delighting in arrows, Both of lovely shape like none of the heavenly gods, As she joined in love to the Aegis-bearing ruler.
</poem>  <START:person> — Hesiod <END>  ,  "Theogony", lines 918–920 (written in the 7th century BCE) Birth.
Various conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology of the birth of Artemis and her twin brother, Apollo.
All accounts agree, however, that she was the daughter of  <START:person> Zeus <END>  and  <START:person> Leto <END>  and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.
An account by  <START:person> Callimachus <END>  has it that Hera forbade  <START:person> Leto <END>  to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island.
Hera was angry with Zeus, her husband, because he had impregnated  <START:person> Leto <END> .
But the island of  <START:person> Delos <END>  (or Ortygia in the Homeric Hymn to Artemis) disobeyed Hera, and  <START:person> Leto <END>  gave birth there.
In ancient Cretan history  <START:person> Leto <END>  was worshipped at Phaistos and in Cretan mythology  <START:person> Leto <END>  gave birth to Apollo and Artemis at the islands known today as the Paximadia.
A "scholium" of Servius on "Aeneid" iii.
72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia by asserting that  <START:person> Zeus <END>  transformed  <START:person> Leto <END>  into a quail ("ortux") in order to prevent Hera from finding out his infidelity, and  <START:person> Kenneth McLeish <END>  suggested further that in quail form  <START:person> Leto <END>  would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.
The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo.
Most stories depict  <START:person> Artemis <END>  as born first, becoming her mother's mid-wife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.
Childhood.
The childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth.
The "Iliad" reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by Hera, climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.
A poem of Callimachus to the goddess "who amuses herself on mountains with archery" imagines some charming vignettes: according to  <START:person> Callimachus <END> , at three years old, Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her six wishes: to remain always a virgin; to have many names to set her apart from her brother Apollo; to be the Phaesporia or Light Bringer; to have a bow and arrow and a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt; to have sixty "daughters of Okeanos", all nine years of age, to be her choir; and for twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested.
She wished for no city dedicated to her, but to rule the mountains, and for the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.
Artemis believed that she had been chosen by the Fates to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo.
All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity.
Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon.
 <START:person> Callimachus <END>  tells how  <START:person> Artemis <END>  spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of Lipara, where Hephaestus and the Cyclops worked.
Okeanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows.
 <START:person> Callimachus <END>  then tells how Artemis visited Pan, the god of the forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs.
She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot.
Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.
Intimacy.
As a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, Orion, won her heart.
Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.
 <START:person> Alpheus <END> , a river god, was in love with Artemis, but he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart.
So he decides to capture her.
 <START:person> Artemis <END> , who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to  <START:person> Alpheus <END> , but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her.
In another story,  <START:person> Alphaeus <END>  tries to rape Artemis' attendant Arethusa.
Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, Artemis Alphaea in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.
 <START:person> Bouphagos <END> , the son of the Titan Iapetos, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her.
Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.
Sipriotes is a boy, who, either because he accidentally sees Artemis bathing or because he attempts to rape her, is turned into a girl by the goddess.
Actaeon.
Multiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary.
The details vary but at the core they involve a great hunter, Actaeon who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs.
Usually the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master.
Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.
According to the standard modern text on the work,  <START:person> Lamar Ronald Lacey <END> 's "The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies", the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her.
For this hubris he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds.
However, in some surviving versions Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her.
Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she, or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of Semele.
Adonis.
In some versions of the story of  <START:person> Adonis <END> , who was a late addition to Greek mythology during the Hellenistic period, Artemis sent a wild boar to kill  <START:person> Adonis <END>  as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than she.
In other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge.
In later myths,  <START:person> Adonis <END>  had been related as a favorite of Aphrodite, and  <START:person> Aphrodite <END>  was responsible for the death of  <START:person> Hippolytus <END> , who had been a favorite of Artemis.
Therefore, Artemis killed  <START:person> Adonis <END>  to avenge Hippolytus’s death.
In yet another version, Adonis was not killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> , but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.
Orion.
Orion was Artemis' hunting companion.
In some versions, he is killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> , while in others he is killed by a scorpion sent by  <START:person> Gaia <END> .
In some versions, Orion tries to seduce Opis, one of Artemis' followers, and she kills him.
In a version by  <START:person> Aratus <END> , Orion takes hold of Artemis' robe and she kills him in self-defense.
In yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion.
According to  <START:person> Hyginus Artemis <END>  once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as Eos did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END> , who was "protective" of his sister's maidenhood.
The Aloadae.
These twin sons of Iphidemia and Poseidon,  <START:person> Otos <END>  and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age.
They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other.
The growth of the Aloadae never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and Hera and take them as wives.
The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them.
The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.
 <START:person> Callisto <END> .
 <START:person> Callisto <END>  was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants.
As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity.
Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo, gained her confidence, then took advantage of her (or raped her, according to Ovid).
As a result of this encounter she conceived a son,  <START:person> Arcas <END> .
Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear.
Arcas almost killed the bear, but  <START:person> Zeus <END>  stopped him just in time.
Out of pity,  <START:person> Zeus <END>  placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of  <START:person> Callisto <END>  the Bear as a constellation.
Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and  <START:person> Callisto <END>  into the heavens as bears, forming the Ursa Minor and Ursa Major constellations.
Iphigenia and the Taurian Artemis.
Artemis punished Agamemnon after he killed a sacred stag in a sacred grove and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess.
When the Greek fleet was preparing at Aulis to depart for Troy to begin the Trojan War, Artemis becalmed the winds.
The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia.
Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer.
Various myths have been told around what happened after Artemis took her.
Either she was brought to  <START:person> Tauros <END>  and led the priests there, or became Artemis' immortal companion.
 <START:person> Niobe <END> .
A Queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion,  <START:person> Niobe <END>  boasted of her superiority to  <START:person> Leto <END>  because while she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven boys and seven girls,  <START:person> Leto <END>  had only one of each.
When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and  <START:person> Artemis <END>  shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound.
Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl.
Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself.
A devastated  <START:person> Niobe <END>  and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept.
The gods themselves entombed them.
Chione.
 <START:person> Chione <END>  was a princess of Pokis.
She was beloved by two gods, Hermes and Apollo, and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once.
Artemis was furious and killed  <START:person> Chione <END>  with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue.
However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.
Atalanta,  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  and the Meleagrids.
Artemis saved the infant Atalanta from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her.
She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters.
But she later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because people said Atalanta was a better hunter.
This is in some stories.
Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, which Artemis had sent to destroy Calydon because King  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices.
In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood, and was awarded the prize of the skin.
She hung it in a sacred grove at Tegea as a dedication to Artemis.
 <START:person> Meleager <END>  was a hero of Aetolia.
King  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the Calydonian Boar.
After the death of  <START:person> Meleager <END> ,  <START:person> Artemis <END>  turned his grieving sisters, the Meleagrids into guineafowl that Artemis loved very much.
Aura.
In Nonnus "Dionysiaca", Aura was Greek goddess of breezes and cool air, daughter of Lelantos and Periboia.
She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood.
One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity.
Artemis asked  <START:person> Nemesis <END>  for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by Dionysus.
Aura became a mad and dangerous killer.
When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, Iakhos, was saved by Artemis.
 <START:person> Iakhos <END>  later became an attendant of Demeter and the leader of Eleusinian Mysteries.
Polyphonte.
 <START:person> Polyphonte <END>  was a young woman who fled home preferring the idea of a virginal life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite.
As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear.
The resulting offspring,  <START:person> Agrius <END>  and  <START:person> Oreius <END> , were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus.
Ultimately the whole family were transformed into birds and more specifically ill portents for mankind.
Trojan War.
Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END>  was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times.
In the "Iliad" she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict.
Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out.
As Artemis fled crying to Zeus,  <START:person> Leto <END>  gathered up the bow and arrows.
Artemis played quite a large part in this war.
Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshiped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans.
At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter.
Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke the promise.
Other sources said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger.
Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery.
In some versions of the myth, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into Hecate, goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.
 <START:person> Aeneas <END>  was helped by Artemis,  <START:person> Leto <END> , and Apollo.
Apollo found him wounded by  <START:person> Diomedes <END>  and lifted him to heaven.
There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.
Worship of Artemis.
Artemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout ancient Greece.
Her best known cults were on the island of  <START:person> Delos <END>  (her birthplace), in Attica at Brauron and Mounikhia (near Piraeus), and in Sparta.
She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows, and accompanied by a deer.
The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new military campaign.
Athenian festivals in honor of Artemis included Elaphebolia, Mounikhia, Kharisteria, and Brauronia.
The festival of Artemis Orthia was observed in Sparta.
Pre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron to serve the Goddess for one year.
During this time, the girls were known as "arktoi", or little she-bears.
A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame.
A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes.
Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged.
She demanded that young girls "act the bear" at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.
Virginal  <START:person> Artemis <END>  was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating Ilithyia, since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin.
During the Classical period in Athens, she was identified with  <START:person> Hecate <END> .
Artemis also assimilated Caryatis (Carya).
Epithets.
As  <START:person> Aeginaea <END> , she was worshiped in Sparta; the name means either huntress of chamois, or the wielder of the javelin (αἰγανέα).
She was worshipped at Naupactus as Aetole; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin.
This "Aetolian Artemis" would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of Ozolian Locris, until it was awarded to the Aetolians by  <START:person> Philip II <END>  of Macedon.
 <START:person> Strabo <END>  records another precinct of "Aetolian Artemos" at the head of the Adriatic.
As Agoraea she was the protector of the agora.
As Agrotera, she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters.
In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local Aeginian goddess, Aphaea.
As  <START:person> Potnia Theron <END> , she was the patron of wild animals; Homer used this title.
As  <START:person> Kourotrophos <END> , she was the nurse of youths.
As Locheia, she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives.
She was sometimes known as  <START:person> Cynthia <END> , from her birthplace on Mount Cynthus on  <START:person> Delos <END> , or Amarynthia from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in Euboea.
She was sometimes identified by the name  <START:person> Phoebe <END> , the feminine form of her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END> 's solar epithet Phoebus.
In Sparta the Artemis "Lygodesma" was worshipped.
This epithet means "willow-bound" from the Gr.
"lygos" (λυγός, willow) and "desmos" (δεσμός, bond).
The willow tree appears in several ancient Greek myths and rituals.
Alphaea, Alpheaea, or Alpheiusa (Gr.
Ἀλφαῖα, Ἀλφεαία, or Ἀλφειοῦσα) was an epithet that Artemis derived from the river god  <START:person> Alpheius <END> , who was said to have been in love with her.
It was under this name that she was worshiped at Letrini in Elis, and in Ortygia.
 <START:person> Artemis Alphaea <END>  was associated with the wearing of masks, largely because of the legend that while fleeing the advances of  <START:person> Alpheius <END> , she and her nymphs escaped him by covering their faces.
Festivals.
 <START:person> Artemis <END>  was born at the sixth day, the reason why it was sacred for her.
Artemis in art.
The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as "Potnia Theron" ("Queen of the Beasts"): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard in her hands, or sometimes a leopard and a lion.
This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as Artemis Orthia, with a sanctuary close by Sparta.
In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt, with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow and arrows.
Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a hunting dog or stag.
When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head.
Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of  <START:person> Niobe <END> .
Artemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the crescent moon, such as also found on  <START:person> Luna <END>  and others.
On June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of "Artemis and the Stag" was sold at Sotheby's auction house in New York state by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery for $25.5 million.
Attributes.
According to the Homeric Hymn to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was  <START:person> Khryselakatos <END> , "of the Golden Shaft", and  <START:person> Iokheira <END>  (Showered by Arrows).
The arrows of Artemis could also bring sudden death and disease to girls and women.
Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father.
The bow of Artemis also became the witness of  <START:person> Callisto <END> 's oath of her virginity.
In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.
Artemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer ( <START:person> Elaphoi Khrysokeroi <END> ).
The bridles of her chariot were also made of gold.
Although quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear.
Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear.
The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis, while Artemis with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing.
As a goddess of maiden dances and songs, Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre.
Fauna.
Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself.
On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred.
Deer were also the first animals she captured.
She caught five golden horned deer called  <START:person> Elaphoi Khrysokeroi <END>  and harnessed them to her chariot.
The third labour of Heracles, commanded by  <START:person> Eurystheus <END> , consisted in catching the Cerynitian Hind alive.
Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive.
Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath.
Artemis got her hunting dogs from Pan in the forest of Arcadia.
Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one these dogs were able to hunt even lions.
Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race.
However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.
The sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started with the  <START:person> Brauron <END>  cult.
Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron.
The Byzantine writer  <START:person> Suidos <END>  relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois.
A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens.
They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them.
A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge.
The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague.
The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').
The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame.
In honor of Artemis' skill, they sacrificed it to her.
Oineus and Adonis were both killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> ' boar.
Artemis felt pity for the Meleagrids as they mourned for their lost brother,  <START:person> Meleagor <END> , so she transformed them into Guinea Fowl to be her favorite animals.
Hawks were the favored birds of many of the gods, Artemis included.
Flora.
Palm and Cypress were issued to be her birthplace.
Other plants sacred to Artemis are Amaranth and Asphodel.
Artemis as "the Lady of Ephesus".
At Ephesus in Ionia, Turkey, her temple became one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
It was probably the best known center of her worship except for  <START:person> Delos <END> .
There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through "interpretatio graeca" was worshiped primarily as a mother goddess, akin to the Phrygian goddess  <START:person> Cybele <END> , in an ancient sanctuary where her cult image depicted the "Lady of Ephesus" adorned with multiple rounded breast-like protuberances on her chest.
They have been variously interpreted as multiple accessory breasts, as eggs, grapes, acorns, or even bull testes.
Excavation at the site of the "Artemision" in 1987-88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped amber beads that had adorned the ancient wooden "xoanon".
In Acts of the Apostles, Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint  <START:person> Paul <END> 's preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"”
Of the 121 columns of her temple, only one composite, made up of fragments, still stands as a marker of the temple's location.
The rest were used for making churches, roads, and forts.
Artemis in astronomy.
A minor planet, 105 Artemis; a lunar crater; the Artemis Chasma and the  <START:person> Artemis Corona <END>  have all been named for her.
Artemis is the acronym for "Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol", a large bolometer camera in the submillimeter range that was installed in 2010 at the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.
 <START:person> Alcopop  Alcopop <END>  (or cooler in Canadian English or spirit cooler in South Africa) is a colloquial term describing certain flavored alcoholic beverages, including: The term "alcopop" (a portmanteau of the words "alcohol" and "sodapop") is used by advocates of tighter restrictions on alcoholic beverage sales, who argue that the beverages are especially appealing to underage drinkers.
Other terms include FAB (flavored alcoholic beverage), FMB (flavored malt beverage), PPS (pre-packaged spirit or premium packaged spirits), and RTD (ready to drink – Australia and New Zealand).
The alcoholic beverage industry does not use the term "alcopop" using terms like wine cooler.
Description.
There is a large variety of beverages produced and marketed around the world as well as within each market which are described as alcopops.
They tend to be sweet and served in small bottles (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in North America, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Europe), and between 4% and 7% ABV.
In Europe, Canada, and South Africa alcopops tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g.
Smirnoff Ice) or rum (e.g.
Bacardi Breezer).
In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as un-hopped beers, depending on the state in which they are sold.
Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring.
Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks.
There are, however, stronger ones that "are" simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g.
Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.
In the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, although some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model, which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.
According to the US Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB): In some Continental European countries, such as Austria and Germany, bottled beer cocktails and shandies are available, which are being marketed the same way like alcopops.
However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.
History.
Wine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when  <START:person> Bartles <END>  and  <START:person> Jaymes <END>  began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when Bacardi introduced the Breezer.
A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with Two Dogs, DNA Alcoholic Spring Water,  <START:person> Hooper <END> 's Hooch and Zima, which was marketed under the title of "malternative beverage".
Wine coolers were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard.
Later,  <START:person> Mike <END> 's Hard Lemonade was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called "violence against lemons".
Smirnoff also came out with another citrus-flavored malt beverage in the United States in the late 1990s called Smirnoff Ice, which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places.
(In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by Diageo as a PPS.)
Some have expressed concern that such drinks might appeal to children as they tend to be sweet and brightly colored.
Many alcopop advertising campaigns have been criticized as trying to make alcopops appeal to young drinkers.
In the United Kingdom, that led to a media outcry during the mid-1990s as the tabloid press associated alcopops with under-age drinking which damaged sales and would lead to off-licences withdrawing them from their stores.
In response to a complaint from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001.
The agency "found no evidence of intent to target minors with the FMB products, packaging, or advertising.
Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data."
The Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, product placement, and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.
"The Commission’s investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs.
Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing" and found that "the majority of FMB drinkers are over the age of 27."
In December 2003, Ireland raised the tax on alcopops to equal that of spirits, the second highest in Europe.
Germany has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 euro per bottle effective August 1, 2004.
To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to wine coolers, which are being marketed the same way.
Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States).
On May 11, 2008, the Australian Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it inline with the tax on spirits.
There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves, possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives.
This tax was revoked during March 2009 meaning the government had to pay back the 290 million collected on the tax.
The Federal Trade Commission report states, "Further, industry-conducted research on consumers over the age of 21 who use FMBs shows that these consumers generally view the FMBs as substitutes for beer, ... This research also concludes that consumers are not likely to consume more than two or three FMBs on any occasion because of the products’ sweetness.
Alcopop brands.
Alcopop brands are numerous and their alcoholic base vary greatly.
Some notable brands include: Smirnoff Ice,  <START:person> Mike <END> 's Hard Lemonade, Bacardi Breezer, Skyy Blue,  <START:person> Jack Daniel <END> 's Hard Cola and in the UK WKD Original Vodka.
Attempts to discourage "alcopops".
Australia.
The Australian government increased the tax on these drinks under the 2008 budget to the same rate as spirits, volumetrically, in an effort to stop binge drinking.
The tax was criticized by the opposition as a tax grab, and voted down in the Senate on March 18, 2009.
Before its rejection, the tax had already raised at least A$290 million after April 2008.
In April 2009, some Labor party MPs planned to resubmit the tax to the Senate, and it was finally approved in August 2009, increasing the cost of the drinks from $39 to $66 a litre.
A 2013 study concluded that the tax had no impact on binge drinking of the drinks by teenagers.
California.
In 2008 AB 346 was signed into law, a bill which requires manufacturers of "alcopops" to carry a 'warning' label stating "ATTENTION: THIS DRINK CONTAINS ALCOHOL."
This bill was praised by groups advocating against alcohol use by minors and younger adults, since these drinks are sometimes favored by young people due to their flavor.
Germany.
On 1 July 2004 the German government increased the tax on mixed drinks based on spirits (e.g.
vodka, rum) by roughly one Euro per 275-ml-bottle in order to stop teenagers drinking excessively, although those drinks were already prohibited to minors under the age of 18.
This had two implications: The most common alcopops, such as Smirnoff Ice or Bacardi Breezer, were nearly taken off the market.
Other manufacturers changed the recipes of their drinks, replacing spirit alcohols by wine or beer, but with the same ABV, enabling these mixed drinks (which are not "alcopops" under German law) to be sold legally to minors 16 and 17 years of age.
South Africa.
In South Africa, "Spirit Coolers" cannot be sold to persons under the age of 18.
They are only sold at liquor stores.
United Kingdom.
In the UK Secretary of State for Health,  <START:person> Patricia Hewitt <END>  called for a tax increase on such products, although this had not yet happened as of October 2013.
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty or ABMT) was a treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems used in defending areas against ballistic missile-delivered nuclear weapons.
Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.
Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years.
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1997 the United States and four former Soviet republics agreed to succeed to the treaty.
In June 2002 the United States withdrew from the treaty, leading to its termination.
Background.
Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming ICBM warheads.
During this period, the US considered the defense of the US as part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange.
As part of this defense, Canada and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called North American Aerospace Defense Command).
By the early 1950s, US research on the Nike Zeus missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of an operational ABM system.
Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as Sprint to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves.
By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed Sentinel.
In 1967, the US announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive Safeguard.
Soviet doctrine called for development of its own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US.
This was achieved with the operational deployment of the A-35 ABM system and its successors, which remain operational to this day.
The development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time.
An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads.
Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would be economically unfeasible: The defenders required one rocket per incoming warhead, whereas the attackers could place 10 warheads on a single missile at a reasonable cost.
To further protect against ABM systems, the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with decoys; R-36M heavy missiles carried as many as 40.
These decoys would appear as warheads to an ABM, effectively requiring engagement of five times as many targets and rendering defense even less effective.
ABM Treaty.
The United States first proposed an anti-ballistic missile treaty at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference during discussions between U.S. Secretary of Defense  <START:person> Robert McNamara <END>  and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union  <START:person> Alexei Kosygin <END> .
 <START:person> McNamara <END>  argued both that ballistic missile defense could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a first-strike against the nation fielding the defense.
 <START:person> Kosygin <END>  rejected this reasoning.
Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks began in November 1969 (SALT I).
By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems.
Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos.
The treaty was signed during the 1972 Moscow Summit on May 26 by the President of the United States,  <START:person> Richard Nixon <END>  and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,  <START:person> Leonid Brezhnev <END> ; and ratified by the US Senate on August 3, 1972.
The 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site.
The sites were Moscow for the USSR and the North Dakota Safeguard Complex for the US, which was already under construction.
Missiles limited by the treaty.
The Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against "strategic ballistic missiles", without attempting to define "strategic".
It was understood that both ICBMs and SLBMs are obviously "strategic".
Both countries did not intend to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs.
The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.
After the SDI announcement.
On March 23, 1983  <START:person> Ronald Reagan <END>  announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, a research program into ballistic missile defense which would be, "consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty".
The project was a blow to  <START:person> Yuri Andropov <END> 's so-called "peace offensive".
 <START:person> Andropov <END>  said that "It is time they [Washington] stopped... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible.
It is insane".
Regardless of the opposition,  <START:person> Reagan <END>  gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system.
The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible.
In "The Nuclear Predicament,"  <START:person> Beckman <END>  claims that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI.
A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a “ragged” Soviet retaliatory response.
Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy.
The Soviets could not afford to ignore  <START:person> Reagan <END> ’s new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans.
By 1987, however, the USSR withdrew its opposition, concluding the SDI posed no threat and scientifically "would never work."
SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result.
SDI research was cut back following the end of  <START:person> Reagan <END> 's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that "missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability."
This was reaffirmed in 1997.
US withdrawal.
Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, in the view of the U.S. Department of State, the treaty continued in force.
An additional memorandum of understanding was prepared in 1997, establishing Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine as successor states to the Soviet Union, for the purposes of the treaty.
On December 13, 2001,  <START:person> George W. Bush <END>  gave Russia notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact—the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.
This led to the eventual creation of the American Missile Defense Agency.
Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited National Missile Defense to protect the United States from nuclear blackmail by a rogue state.
The withdrawal had many critics as well as supporters.
 <START:person> John Rhinelander <END> , a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a "fatal blow" to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and would lead to a "world without effective legal constraints on nuclear proliferation."
The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear first strike.
Russia and the United States signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty in Moscow on May 24, 2002.
This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.

Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  1974 Protocol   Acts of Union 1707  The Acts of Union were two Acts of Parliament: the Union with Scotland Act 1706 passed by the Parliament of England, and the Union with England Act passed in 1707 by the Parliament of Scotland.
They put into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries.
The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate states with separate legislatures, but with the same monarch) into a single, united kingdom named "Great Britain".
The two countries had shared a monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King  <START:person> James VI <END>  of Scotland inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, Queen  <START:person> Elizabeth I. <END> 
Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later Kingdom of Great Britain).
There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.
The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707.
On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the Parliament of Great Britain, based in the Palace of Westminster in London, the home of the English Parliament.
Hence, the Acts are referred to as the Union of the Parliaments.
On the Union, the historian  <START:person> Simon Schama <END>  said "What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."
Historical background.
Previous attempts at union.
England and Scotland were separate states for several centuries before eventual union, and English attempts to take over Scotland by military force in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were ultimately unsuccessful (see the Wars of Scottish Independence).
The first attempts at Union surrounded the foreseen unification of the Royal lines of Scotland and England.
In pursuing the Scottish throne in the 1560s,  <START:person> Mary <END> , Queen of Scots pledged herself to a peaceful union between the two kingdoms.
England and Scotland were ruled by the same king for the first time in 1603 when  <START:person> James VI <END>  of Scotland also became the king of England.
However they remained two separate states until 1 May 1707.
Early  <START:person> Stuart <END>  union.
The first attempt to unite the parliaments of England and Scotland was by  <START:person> Mary <END> 's son, King  <START:person> James VI <END>  and I. On his accession to the English throne in 1603 King  <START:person> James <END>  announced his intention to unite his two realms so that he would not be "guilty of bigamy".
 <START:person> James <END>  used his Royal prerogative powers to take the style of 'King of Great Britain' and to give an explicitly British character to his court and person.
Whilst  <START:person> James <END>  assumed the creation of a full union was a foregone conclusion, the Parliament of England was concerned that the formation of a new state would deprive England of its ancient liberties, taking on the more absolutist monarchical structure  <START:person> James <END>  had previously enjoyed in Scotland.
In the meantime,  <START:person> James <END>  declared that Great Britain be viewed 'as presently united, and as one realm and kingdom, and the subjects of both realms as one people'.
The Scottish and English parliaments established a commission to negotiate a union, formulating an instrument of union between the two countries.
However, the idea of political union was unpopular, and when  <START:person> James <END>  dropped his policy of a speedy union, the topic quietly disappeared from the legislative agenda.
When the House of Commons attempted to revive the proposal in 1610, it was met with a more open hostility.
Union during the interregnum.
The Solemn League and Covenant 1643 sought a forced union of the Church of England into the Church of Scotland, and although the covenant referred repeatedly to union between the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a political union was not spelled out.
In the aftermath of the Civil War, in which the Covenanters had fought for the King,  <START:person> Oliver Cromwell <END>  occupied Scotland and began a process of creating a 'Godly Britannic' Union between the former Kingdoms.
In 1651, the Parliament of England issued the Tender of Union declaration supporting Scotland's incorporation into the Commonwealth and sent Commissioners to Scotland with the express purpose of securing support for Union, which was assented to by the Commissioners (Members of Parliament) in Scotland.
On 12 April 1654,  <START:person> Cromwell <END>  – styling himself Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland – enacted "An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland," which created 'one Commonwealth and under one Government' to be known as the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.
The ordinance was ratified by the Second Protectorate Parliament, as an Act of Union, on 26 June 1657.
One united Parliament sat in Westminster, with 30 representatives from Scotland and 30 from Ireland joining the existing members from England.
Whilst free trade was brought about amongst the new Commonwealth, the economic benefits were generally not felt as a result of heavy taxation used to fund  <START:person> Cromwell <END> 's New Model Army.
This republican union was dissolved automatically with the restoration of King  <START:person> Charles II <END>  to the thrones of England and Scotland.
Scottish members expelled from the Commonwealth Parliament petitioned unsuccessfully for a continuance of the union.
 <START:person> Cromwell <END> 's union had simultaneously raised interest in and suspicion of the concept of union and when  <START:person> Charles II <END>  attempted to recreate the union and fulfil the work of his grandfather in 1669, negotiations between Commissioners ground to a halt.
Later attempts.
An abortive scheme for union occurred in Scotland in 1670.
Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the records of the Parliament of Scotland show much discussion of possible union.
 <START:person> William <END>  and  <START:person> Mary <END> , whilst supportive of the idea, had no interest in allowing it to delay their enthronement.
Impetus for this incorporating union came almost entirely from King  <START:person> William <END> , who feared leaving Scotland open to a French invasion.
In the 1690s, the economic position of Scotland worsened, and relations between Scotland and England became strained.
In the following decade, however, union again became a significant topic of political debate.
Treaty and passage of the Acts of 1707.
Deeper political integration had been a key policy of Queen  <START:person> Anne <END>  from the time she acceded to the throne in 1702.
Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.
Both countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations.
Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials.
At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Seafield.
The English commissioners included the Lord High Treasurer, the Earl of Godolphin, the Lord Keeper,  <START:person> Baron Cowper <END> , and a large number of Whigs who supported union.
Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.
Negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the Cockpit in London.
Each side had its own particular concerns.
Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the Hanoverian dynasty would succeed  <START:person> Queen Anne <END>  to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.
After negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments.
In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the Parliament of Scotland were supportive of the Court Party.
For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the  <START:person> Squadrone Volante <END> , led by the Marquess of Montrose and the Duke of Roxburghe.
Opponents of the court were generally known as the Country party, and included various factions and individuals such as the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Belhaven and  <START:person> Andrew Fletcher <END>  of  <START:person> Saltoun <END> , who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union.
The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the Darien Disaster.
In Scotland, the Duke of Queensberry was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the Scottish Parliament.
In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action.
He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself.
In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road.
From Barnet, the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed.
On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at Kensington Palace.
Political motivations.
English perspective.
The English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne.
The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England.
The English succession was provided for by the English Act of Settlement 1701, which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the House of Hanover.
Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after Queen  <START:person> Anne <END> : the Scottish Act of Security 1704 granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation.
Many people in England were unhappy about the prospect, however.
English overseas possessions made England very wealthy in comparison to Scotland, a poor country with few roads, very little industry and almost no Navy.
This made some view unification as a markedly unequal relationship.
Scottish perspective.
In Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the Darien scheme through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the Alien Act to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.
The combined votes of the Court party with a majority of the  <START:person> Squadrone Volante <END>  were sufficient to ensure the final passage of the treaty through the House.
Personal financial interests were also allegedly involved.
Many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien Scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 15 granted £398,085 10s sterling to Scotland, a sum known as The Equivalent, to offset future liability towards the English national debt.
In essence it was also used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien Scheme, as 58.6% was allocated to its shareholders and creditors.
Even more direct bribery was also said to be a factor.
£20,000 (£240,000 Scots) was dispatched to Scotland for distribution by the Earl of Glasgow.
 <START:person> James Douglas <END> , 2nd  <START:person> Duke of Queensberry <END> , the Queen's Commissioner in Parliament, received £12,325, more than 60% of the funding.
(Some contend that all of this money was properly accounted for as compensation for loss of office, pensions and so forth not outwith the usual run of government.
It is perhaps a debate that will never be set to rest.
However, modern research has shown that payments were made to supporters of union that appear not to have been overdue salaries.
At least four payments were made to people who were not even members of the Scottish Parliament.)
 <START:person> Robert Burns <END>  referred to this: <poem>We're bought and sold for English Gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.</poem>
Some of the money was used to hire spies, such as  <START:person> Daniel Defoe <END> ; his first reports were of vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union.
"A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind," he reported, "for every Scot in favour there is 99 against".
Years later Sir  <START:person> John Clerk of Penicuik <END> , originally a leading Unionist, wrote in his memoirs that, ( <START:person> Defoe <END> ) was a spy among us, but not known as such, otherwise the Mob of Edinburgh would pull him to pieces.
 <START:person> Defoe <END>  recalls that he was hired by  <START:person> Robert Harley <END> .
The Treaty could be considered unpopular in Scotland: Sir  <START:person> George Lockhart <END>  of Carnwath, the only member of the Scottish negotiating team against union, noted that "The whole nation appears against the Union" and even Sir  <START:person> John Clerk of Penicuik <END> , an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was "contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom".
Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes.
The Convention of Royal Burghs also petitioned against the Union as proposed: That it is our indispensable duty to signify to your grace that, as we are not against an honourable and safe union with England far less can we expect to have the condition of the people of Scotland, with relation to these great concerns, made better and improved without a Scots Parliament.
Not one petition in favour of an incorporating union was received by Parliament.
On the day the treaty was signed, the carilloner in St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune "Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?" Threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing martial law.
Irish perspective.
Ireland, the third of the "sister kingdoms", was not included in the union.
The effective government of Ireland was in the hands of the 'Protestant Ascendancy', a minority elite (about 10% of the population).
The Roman Catholic majority were systematically excluded from political and military discourse through a series of post-Cromwellian Penal Laws, limiting their rights to property, education, and the franchise.
In July 1707 each House of the Parliament of Ireland passed a congratulatory address to  <START:person> Queen Anne <END> , praying that "May God put it in your royal heart to add greater strength and lustre to your crown, by a still more comprehensive Union".
The British government did not respond to the invitation and an equal union between Great Britain and Ireland was out of consideration until the 1790s.
Ireland's benefits from the Union of 1707 were therefore few.
Its preferential status in trade with England now extended to Scotland.
However, Ireland was left unequal and unrepresented in the Parliament of Great Britain.
The Kingdom of Ireland was to remain separate, and legally subordinate to Great Britain until 1784.
The union with Ireland finally came about on 1 January 1801.
Provisions of the Acts.
The Treaty of Union, agreed between representatives of the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature.
In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees.
Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706.
To minimise the opposition of the Church of Scotland, an Act was also passed to secure the Presbyterian establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy.
The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.
The two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send representative peers from the Peerage of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords.
It guaranteed that the Church of Scotland would remain the established church in Scotland, that the Court of Session would "remain in all time coming within Scotland", and that Scots law would "remain in the same force as before".
Other provisions included the restatement of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the ban on Roman Catholics from taking the throne.
It also created a customs union and monetary union.
The Act provided that any "laws and statutes" that were "contrary to or inconsistent with the terms" of the Act would "cease and become void."
Soon after the Union, the Act 6  <START:person> Anne <END>  c.40 (later infelicitously named the Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707) united the English and Scottish Privy Councils and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration.
In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the College of Justice.
Criticisms.
The English and Scottish parliaments had evolved along different lines; especially, the Parliament of Scotland had been unicameral while that of England had been bicameral.
Following Union, the parliament at Westminster followed the English model.
 <START:person> Defoe <END>  drew upon his Scottish experience to write his "Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Britain", published in 1726, where he admitted that the increase of trade and population in Scotland, which he had predicted as a consequence of the Union, was "not the case, but rather the contrary".
However, by the time  <START:person> Samuel Johnson <END>  and  <START:person> James Boswell <END>  made their tour in 1773, recorded in "A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland",  <START:person> Johnson <END>  noted that Scotland was "a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing" and in particular that Glasgow had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.
300th anniversary.
A commemorative two-pound coin was issued to mark the tercentennial—300th anniversary—of the Union, which occurred two days before the Scottish Parliament general election on 3 May 2007.
The Scottish Executive held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the National Museums of Scotland and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the National Galleries of Scotland.
Scottish voting records.
<noinclude>   <START:person> Arthur Jensen  Arthur Robert Jensen <END>  (August 24, 1923 – October 22, 2012) was a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was known for his work in psychometrics and differential psychology, which is concerned with how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.
He was a major proponent of the hereditarian position in the nature and nurture debate, the position that genetics play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as intelligence and personality.
He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals and sat on the editorial boards of the scientific journals "Intelligence" and "Personality and Individual Differences".
He was rated as one of the 50 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century.
He was also a controversial figure, largely for his conclusions regarding the causes of race-based differences in intelligence.
Early life.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was born August 24, 1923, in San Diego, California, the son of  <START:person> Linda Mary <END>  (née Schachtmayer) and  <START:person> Arthur Alfred Jensen <END> , who operated and owned a lumber and building materials company.
His paternal grandparents were Danish immigrants and his mother was of half Polish Jewish and half German descent.
He studied at University of California, Berkeley (B.A. 1945), San Diego State College (M.A., 1952) and Columbia University (Ph.D., 1956), and did his doctoral thesis with  <START:person> Percival Symonds <END>  on the Thematic Apperception Test: He published this work.
From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the University of London, Institute of Psychiatry with  <START:person> Hans Eysenck <END> .
Upon returning to the United States, he became a researcher and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of culture, development, and genetics on intelligence and learning.
He received tenure at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first sabbatical in 1964.
He has concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students.
In 2003, he was awarded the Kistler Prize for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human genome and human society.
In 2006, the International Society for Intelligence Research awarded  <START:person> Jensen <END>  its Lifetime Achievement Award.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  has had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a conductor himself.
At 14, he conducted a band that won a nationwide contest held in San Francisco.
Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a seminar given by  <START:person> Nikolai Sokoloff <END> .
Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to New York, mainly to be near the conductor  <START:person> Arturo Toscanini <END> .
He was also deeply interested in the life and example of  <START:person> Gandhi <END> , producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life.
During  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's period in San Diego he spent time working as a social worker with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.
IQ and academic achievement.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children.
The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability.
"Level I", or associative learning, may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills.
"Level II", or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.
Later,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the general factor of intelligence, a concept which was essentially synonymous with his "Level II" conceptual learning.
The general factor, or "g", is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  claimed, on the basis of his research, that general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait, determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions.
He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.
He suggested that from the data one might conclude that, on average, European Americans are more intelligent than African Americans.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the "Harvard Educational Review", was titled "How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?"
It concluded, among other things, that Head Start programs designed to boost African-American IQ scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.
The work became one of—if not the most—cited papers in the history of psychological testing and intelligence research.
After the paper was released, students and faculty staged large protests outside  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's U.C. Berkeley office.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was denied reprints of his work by his publisher and was not permitted to reply in response to letters of criticism—both extremely unusual policies for their day.
In a later article,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  argued that his claims had been misunderstood: ...nowhere have I "claimed" an "innate deficiency" of intelligence in blacks.
My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: "The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations.
The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question."
( <START:person> Jensen <END> , 1981a, p. 213).
 <START:person> Thomas Sowell <END>  wrote: Professor  <START:person> Jensen <END>  pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him.
He did this because "I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate."
What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor  <START:person> Jensen <END>  has had.
However,  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's 1998 "" gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ.
In Chapter 12: Population Differences in "g": Causal Hypotheses,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  writes: The relationship of the g factor to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e.,  <START:person> Spearman <END> 's hypothesis) suggests that the average white-black difference in "g" has a biological component.
Human races are viewed not as discrete, or Platonic, categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes.
The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies.
Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly "g".
In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on "Mainstream Science on Intelligence, " an editorial written by  <START:person> Linda Gottfredson <END>  and published in the "Wall Street Journal", which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the meaning and significance of IQ following the publication of the book "The Bell Curve".
In 2005,  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's article, co-written with  <START:person> J. Philippe Rushton <END> , named "Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability", was published in the APA journal "Psychology, Public Policy and Law".
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  and  <START:person> Rushton <END>  present ten categories of evidence in support of the notion that IQ differences between whites and blacks are partly genetic in origin.
Death.
He died on October 22, 2012 at his home in Kelseyville, California at age 89.
Criticism.
 <START:person> Melvin Konner <END>  wrote in the notes to his book "The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit": Statements made by  <START:person> Arthur Jensen <END> ,  <START:person> William Shockley <END> , and other investigators in the late 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions.
Many of these statements were proved wrong, but they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence is very difficult to recant.
Many studies that purport to be both science-based and attempt to influence public policy have been accused of scientific racism.
 <START:person> Konner <END>  wrote: What of the latest currents of thought?
Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy?
The indications are not all encouraging.
 <START:person> Richard Herrnstein <END>  and  <START:person> Charles Murray <END>  published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as  <START:person> Jensen <END>  and others had in the 1960s and 1970s.
"The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life" (New York: Free Press 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the racial divide in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.
Their general assertions about genes and IQ were not very controversial, but their speculations on race were something else again.
By 1994, the time of The Bell Curve's publishing,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  had received $1.1 million from the Pioneer Fund, an organization frequently described as racist and "white supremacist" in nature.
The fund contributed a total of $3.5 million to researchers cited in The Bell Curve's most controversial chapter "that suggests some races are naturally smarter than others" with  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's works being cited twenty-three times in the book's bibliography.
 <START:person> Lisa Suzuki <END>  and  <START:person> Joshua Aronson <END>  of New York University claimed in 2005 that  <START:person> Jensen <END>  has largely ignored evidence that fails to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent a genetic racial hierarchy unwaveringly for over 30 years.
Paleontologist and evolutionary biologist  <START:person> Stephen Jay Gould <END>  attacked  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's work in his 1981 book "The Mismeasure of Man".
 <START:person> Gould <END>  writes that  <START:person> Jensen <END>  misapplies the concept of "heritability", which is defined as a measure of the variation of a trait due to inheritance "within" a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156-157).
According to  <START:person> Gould <END> ,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  uses heritability to measure differences "between" populations.
 <START:person> Gould <END>  also disagrees with  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, "g", or "the general factor common to a large number of cognitive abilities" which can be measured along a unilinear scale.
This is a claim most closely identified with  <START:person> Charles Spearman <END> .
According to  <START:person> Gould <END> ,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  misunderstood the research of  <START:person> L. L. Thurstone <END>  to ultimately support this claim;  <START:person> Gould <END> , however, argues that  <START:person> Thurstone <END> 's factor analysis of intelligence revealed "g" to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314).
 <START:person> Gould <END>  criticizes  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's sources including his use of  <START:person> Catharine Cox <END> 's 1926 "Genetic Studies of Genius", which examines historiometrically the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths ( <START:person> Gould <END>  1981: 153-154).
In 1980  <START:person> Jensen <END>  published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled "Bias in Mental Testing".
Reviewing this book, psychologist  <START:person> Kenneth Kaye <END>  endorsed  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's distinction between bias and discrimination.
The purpose of tests is to discriminate (that is, reveal actual differences) on the basis of ability; bias constitutes error.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  defined any test as biased for a particular group if that group differs significantly from the majority group in the slopes, intercepts, or standard error of the estimates of their regression lines.
Most studies found no difference in the regression lines between black and white groups, but those differences that had been found to be biased had overpredicted rather than underpredicted the minority group's performance (for example, grades in Officer Candidate courses).
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's conclusion: Until we find out what the relevant psychological predictors are for which racial classification per se is merely a 'stand-in' variable, we have no choice but to include race (or other group membership) as a predictive variable along with the test scores or other predictive measures.
On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.
Pointing out that "many of  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's opponents allowed their scientific conclusions to be far more biased by their political views than he did,  <START:person> Kaye <END>  quoted 18th-century  <START:person> David Hume <END> : "There is no Method of Reasoning more Common, and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical Debates, to endeavor the Refutation of any Hypothesis, by a Pretext of its dangerous Consequences to Religion and Morality."
In a 1982 review of "The Mismeasure of Man",  <START:person> Jensen <END>  gives point-by-point rebuttals to much of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's critique, including  <START:person> Gould <END> 's treatment of heritability, the "reification" of "g", and the use of Thurstone's analysis.
 <START:person> Gould <END>  responded to  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's rebuttals in a revised edition of the book, published in 1996.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's response and criticism.
In  <START:person> Arthur Jensen <END> 's response to  <START:person> Gould <END> 's criticisms, in the paper titled "The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons".,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  begins his paper with this observation  <START:person> Stephen Jay Gould <END>  is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, "Biology as a Social Weapon."
Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book.
Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of  <START:person> Gould <END>  when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist  <START:person> Edward O. Wilson <END> , a leader in the development of sociobiology...
While  <START:person> Jensen <END>  recognizes the validity of some of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's claims, in many places, he criticizes  <START:person> Gould <END> 's general approach This charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth.
In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the Marxist interpretation of the history of science.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  adds that  <START:person> Gould <END>  made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's own positions In his references to my own work,  <START:person> Gould <END>  includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's opinion; in these citations  <START:person> Gould <END>  purportedly paraphrases my views.
Yet in eight of the nine cases,  <START:person> Gould <END> 's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured.
Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources.
While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears  <START:person> Gould <END> 's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner,  <START:person> James R. Flynn <END> : Now and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue?
The name  <START:person> James R. Flynn <END>  is by far the first that comes to mind.
His book, "Race, IQ and  <START:person> Jensen <END> " (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.
Books.
The "g" Factor.
"" (1998) is a book on the general intelligence factor ("g").
The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.
Clocking the Mind.
"Clocking the Mind : Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences" (2006) deals with mental chronometry (MC), and covers a variety of techniques for measuring the speed with which the brain processes information.
Whereas IQ merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability.
Amyl nitrite  Amyl nitrite is the chemical compound with the formula C5H11ONO.
A variety of isomers are known, but they all feature an amyl group attached to the nitrite functional group.
The alkyl group is unreactive and the chemical and biological properties are mainly due to the nitrite group.
Like other alkyl nitrites, amyl nitrite is bioactive in mammals, being a vasodilator, which is the basis of its use as a prescription medicine.
As an inhalant, it also has a psychoactive effect, which has led to its recreational use.
Nomenclature.
The term "amyl nitrite" encompasses several isomers.
For example, a common form of amyl nitrite with the formula (CH3)2CHCH2CH2ONO may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite.
When the amyl group is a linear or normal (n) alkyl group, the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH3(CH2)4ONO.
Despite a very similar name to amyl nitrite, amyl nitrate has a different chemical composition and different properties.
Synthesis and reactions.
Alkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of alcohols with nitrous acid: The reaction is called esterification.
Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories.
A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol.
The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrous and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily decanted from the reaction mixture.
Isoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the isoamyl alcohol: Amyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with carbanions to give oximes.
Amyl nitrites are also useful as reagents in a modification of the  <START:person> Sandmeyer <END>  reaction.
The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic amine in a halogenated solvent produces a radical aromatic species, this then abstracts a halogen atom from the solvent.
For the synthesis of aryl iodides diiodomethane is used, whereas bromoform is the solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl bromides.
Physiological effects.
Amyl nitrite, in common with other alkyl nitrites, is a potent vasodilator; it expands blood vessels, resulting in lowering of the blood pressure.
Alkyl nitrites are a source of nitric oxide, which signals for relaxation of the involuntary muscles.
Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the blood vessel walls and the internal and external anal sphincter.
There are no withdrawal symptoms.
Overdose symptoms include nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypoventilation, shortness of breath, and fainting.
The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear within a few minutes.
Amyl nitrate may also intensify the experience of synesthesia.
Applications.
Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat heart diseases such as angina.
It is also used as an inhalant drug that induces a brief euphoric state, and when combined with other intoxicant stimulant drugs such as cocaine or ecstasy (see MDMA), the euphoric state intensifies and is prolonged.
Once some stimulative drugs wear off, a common side effect is a period of depression or anxiety, colloquially called a "come down"; amyl nitrite is sometimes used to combat these negative after-effects.
This effect, combined with its dissociative effects, has led to its use as a recreational drug (see poppers).
Amyl nitrite is also sometimes used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning.
It can act as an oxidant, to induce the formation of methemoglobin.
Methemoglobin in turn can sequester cyanide as cyanomethemoglobin.
Alexandria Troas  Alexandria Troas ("Alexandria of the Troad"; Greek: Αλεξάνδρεια Τρωάς; Turkish: "Eski Stambul") is the site of an ancient Greek city situated on the Aegean Sea near the northern tip of Turkey's western coast, a little south of Tenedos (modern Bozcaada).
It is located southeast of modern Dalyan, a village in the Ezine district of Çanakkale Province.
The site sprawls over an estimated 400 ha; among the few structures remaining today are a ruined bath, an odeon, a theatre, gymnasium complex and a recently uncovered stadion.
The circuit of the old walls can still be traced.
History.
Hellenistic.
According to  <START:person> Strabo <END> , this site was first called Sigeia; around 306 BC Antigonus refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia, including the once influential city of Neandreia.
It did not receive its name until its name was changed by  <START:person> Lysimachus <END>  to Alexandria Troas, in 301 BC, in memory of  <START:person> Alexander III of Macedon <END>  ( <START:person> Pliny <END>  merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria).
As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a "free and autonomous city" as early as 188 BC, and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance.
In its heyday the city may have had a population of about 100,000.
 <START:person> Strabo <END>  mentions that a Roman colony was created at the location in the reign of Augustus, named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period).
 <START:person> Augustus <END> ,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  and the rich grammarian  <START:person> Herodes Atticus <END>  contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter.
 <START:person> Constantine <END>  considered making Troas the capital of the Roman Empire.
Roman.
In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between Anatolia and Europe.
 <START:person> Paul <END>  of Tarsus sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of Eutychus later occurred).
 <START:person> Ignatius <END>  of Antioch also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.
Byzantine.
Several of its later bishops are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344;  <START:person> Sylvanus <END>  at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451;  <START:person> Leo <END>  in 787;  <START:person> Peter <END> , friend of the Patriarch  <START:person> Ignatius <END> , and adversary to  <START:person> Michael <END> , in the ninth century.
In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of Cyzicus and distinct from the famous Troy ( <START:person> Heinrich Gelzer <END> , "Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum", 552; "Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani", 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared.
The bishopric remains a titular see of the Catholic Church under the name Troas, vacant since 1971.
Troas is also a titular see of the Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
Bishop  <START:person> Savas <END>  ( <START:person> Zembillas <END> ) of  <START:person> Troas <END>  served as hierarch from 2002 to 2011, and then became Metropolitan  <START:person> Savas <END>  ( <START:person> Zembillas <END> ) of Pittsburgh in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.
Ottoman.
Karasid Turkomans settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century.
Their "beylik" was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336.
The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as " <START:person> Eski Stambul <END> ", the "Old City".
The site's stones were much plundered for building material (for example  <START:person> Mehmed IV <END>  took columns to adorn his Yeni Valide Mosque in Istanbul).
As of the mid-18th century the site served as "a lurking place for bandetti".
Modern.
By 1911, the site had been overgrown with vallonea oaks and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved.
They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals.
Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as "Bal Saray" (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by  <START:person> Herodes Atticus <END>  in the year 135.
 <START:person> Trajan <END>  built an aqueduct which can still be traced.
The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand.
It is the subject of an early twenty-first century study by German archaeologists digging and surveying at the site.
Their excavation uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100 BC.
Epsilon Ursae Majoris  Epsilon Ursae Majoris (Epsilon UMa, ε Ursae Majoris, ε UMa) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Major (despite its Bayer designation being merely "epsilon"), and at magnitude 1.76 is the thirty-first brightest star in the sky.
It has the traditional name Alioth.
It is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body, and thus the star in the handle of the Big Dipper (Plough) closest to the bowl.
It is also a member of the large and diffuse Ursa Major moving group.
Historically, the star was frequently used in celestial navigation in the maritime trade, because it is listed as one of the 57 navigational stars.[1]
Peculiarities.
According to "Hipparcos",  <START:person> Alioth <END>  is 81 light years (25 parsecs) from Earth.
Its spectral type is A0p; the "p" stands for "peculiar", as the spectrum of its light is characteristic of an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable.
 <START:person> Alioth <END> , as a representative of this type, may harbor two interacting processes.
First, the star's strong magnetic field separating different elements in the star's hydrogen 'fuel'.
In addition, a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis may be spinning different bands of magnetically sorted elements into the line of sight between Alioth and the Earth.
The intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of light as they whip in and out of view, causing Alioth to have very strange spectral lines that fluctuate over a period of 5.1 days.
With  <START:person> Alioth <END> , the rotational and magnetic axes are at almost 90 degrees to one another.
Darker (denser) regions of chromium form a band at right angles to the equator.
A recent study suggests  <START:person> Alioth <END> 's 5.1-day variation may be due to a substellar object of about 14.7 Jupiter masses in an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) with an average separation of 0.055 astronomical units.
 <START:person> Alioth <END>  has a relatively weak magnetic field, 15 times weaker than α CVn, but it is still 100 times stronger than that of the Earth.
Namesakes.
USS Allioth (AK-109) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.
Arianespace  Arianespace SA is a European multinational company founded in 1980 as the world's first commercial launch service provider.
Seated in France, it undertakes the production, operation, and marketing of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle as part of the Ariane programme.
Two other launch systems are offered by the company, the Soyuz-2 as a medium-lift alternative to Ariane 5, and the Vega as a lighter one.
s of 2004[ [update]], Arianespace held more than 50 percent of the world market for boosting satellites to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).
More than 240 commercial launches have occurred since May 22, 1984, and Arianespace states that the total number of launch contracts signed since Ariane launches commenced operations in 1984 is 285.
Arianespace uses the Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guiana as a launch site.
It has its headquarters in Courcouronnes, Essonne, France, near Évry.
On 21 October 2011 Arianespace launched the first Soyuz rocket ever from outside former Soviet territory.
The payload was two Galileo navigation satellites.
The company and its infrastructure.
Arianespace primary shareholders are its suppliers, in the various nations of the European Union.
Arianespace currently has 21 shareholders: Competition and pricing.
The disruptive force represented in new sector entrant SpaceX, forced Arianespace to cut workforce, and focus on cost-cutting, to decrease costs to remain competitive against the new low-cost entrant in the launch sector.
According to one Arianespace managing director, ""It's quite clear there's a very significant challenge coming from SpaceX," he said.
"Therefore things have to change … and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined."
In the midst of pricing pressure from U.S. company SpaceX, Arianespace made a November 2013 announcement of pricing flexibility for the "lighter satellites" it carries to Geostationary orbits aboard its Ariane 5.
In early 2014, Arianespace requested additional subsidies from European governments to face the competition from SpaceX and unfavorable changes in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate.
Reducing pricing allowed Arianespace to sign four additional contracts in September 2014 for a lower slots on an Ariane 5 SYLDA dispenser for the satellites that otherwise could be flown on SpaceX launch vehicle.
Overall Arianespace signed 11 contracts in 2014 until September with two additional being in a late stage of negotiations.
s of September 2014[ [update]] Arianespace has a backlog of launches worth € billion with 38 satellites to be launched on Ariane 5, 7 on Soyuz and 9 on  <START:person> Vega <END> , claiming 60% of global satellite launch market.
By November 2014, SpaceX had "already begun to take market share" from Arianespace, and Eutelsat CEO  <START:person> Michel de Rosen <END> —a major customer of Arianespace—said that "Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through economies of scale."
Launch Vehicles.
Currently Arianespace operates 3 launch vehicles, including two versions of Ariane 5: Additionally Arianespace offers optional back-up launch service on H-IIA through Launch Services Alliance.
Ariane launch vehicles.
Since the first launch in 1979, there have been several versions of the Ariane launch vehicle:  Advanced Power Management  Advanced power management (APM) is an API developed by Intel and Microsoft and released in 1992 which enables an operating system running an IBM-compatible personal computer to work with the BIOS (part of the computer's firmware) to achieve power management.
Revision 1.2 was the last version of the APM specification, released in 1996.
ACPI is intended as the successor to APM.
Microsoft dropped support for APM in Windows Vista.
The Linux kernel still mostly supports APM, with the last fully functional APM support shipping in 3.3.
Overview.
APM uses a layered approach to manage devices.
APM-aware applications (which include device drivers) talk to an OS-specific APM driver.
This driver communicates to the APM-aware BIOS, which controls the hardware.
There is the ability to opt out of APM control on a device-by-device basis, which can be used if a driver wants to communicate directly with a hardware device.
Communication occurs both ways; power management events are sent from the BIOS to the APM driver, and the APM driver sends information and requests to the BIOS via function calls.
In this way the APM driver is an intermediary between the BIOS and the operating system.
Power management happens in two ways; through the above-mentioned function calls from the APM driver to the BIOS requesting power state changes, and automatically based on device activity.
Power management events.
There are 12 power events (such as standby, suspend and resume requests, and low battery notifications), plus OEM-defined events, that can be sent from the APM BIOS to the operating system.
The APM driver regularly polls for event change notifications.
Power Management Events: Power management functions: APM functions.
There are 21 APM function calls defined that the APM driver can use to query power management statuses, or request power state transitions.
Example function calls include letting the BIOS know about current CPU usage (the BIOS may respond to such a call by placing the CPU in a low-power state, or returning it to its full-power state), retrieving the current power state of a device, or requesting a power state change.
Power states.
The APM specification defines system power states and device power states.
System power states.
APM defines five power states for the computer system: Device power states.
APM also defines power states that APM-aware hardware can implement.
There is no requirement that an APM-aware device implement all states.
The four states are: CPU.
The CPU core (defined in APM as the CPU clock, cache, system bus and system timers) is treated specially in APM, as it is the last device to be powered down, and the first device to be powered back up.
The CPU core is always controlled through the APM BIOS (there is no option to control it through a driver).
Drivers can use APM function calls to notify the BIOS about CPU usage, but it is up to the BIOS to act on this information; a driver cannot directly tell the CPU to go into a power saving state.
Anarchism  Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self-governed voluntary institutions, but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations.
Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.
While anti-statism is central, anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.
As an anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy.
Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.
There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.
Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.
Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.
Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.
Etymology and terminology.
The term "anarchism" is a compound word composed from the word "anarchy" and the suffix "-ism", themselves derived respectively from the Greek ἀναρχία, i.e. "anarchy" (from ἄναρχος, "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the privative prefix ἀν("an-", i.e. "without") and ἀρχός, "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf.
"archon" or ἀρχή, "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix -ισμός or -ισμα ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal infinitive suffix -ίζειν, "-izein").
The first known use of this word was in 1539.
Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as  <START:person> Robespierre <END>  did the Hébertists) although few shared many views of later anarchists.
There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  and  <START:person> Wilhelm Weitling <END> , but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.
The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END> , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century.
Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.
On the other hand, some use "libertarianism" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "libertarian anarchism".
History.
Origins.
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of Taoist philosopher  <START:person> Laozi <END> , and in later centuries by  <START:person> Zhuangzi <END>  and  <START:person> Bao Jingyan <END> .
 <START:person> Zhuangzi <END> 's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist.
 <START:person> Zhuangzi <END>  wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail.
A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation."
 <START:person> Diogenes <END>  of Sinope and the Cynics, their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics.
 <START:person> Jesus <END>  is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition.
 <START:person> Georges Lechartier <END>  wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles."
In early Islamic history, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate, where the  <START:person> Kharijites <END>  insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.
Later, some Muslim scholars, such as  <START:person> Amer al-Basri <END>  and  <START:person> Abu Hanifa <END> , led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the waqf (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs.
But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible.
This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry.
The French renaissance political philosopher  <START:person> Étienne de La Boétie <END>  wrote in his most famous work the "Discourse on Voluntary Servitude" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.
The radical Protestant Christian  <START:person> Gerrard Winstanley <END>  and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.
The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the English Civil War, as a term of abuse, used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents.
By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the "Enragés", began to use the term positively, in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as oxymoronic.
By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly  <START:person> Jean-Jacques Rousseau <END> 's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution,  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  was, according to  <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END> , "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while  <START:person> Godwin <END>  attached his anarchist ideas to an early  <START:person> Edmund Burke <END> .
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'.
He argued in "Political Justice" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance.
He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force.
Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power.
Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.
His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage.
He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation.
In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.
The French  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END>  is regarded as the first "self-proclaimed" anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, "What is Property?,"
published in 1840.
It is for this reason that some claim  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  as the founder of modern anarchist theory.
He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order."
In "What is Property?"
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  answers with the famous accusation "Property is theft."
In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish.
He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use.
Later, however,  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  added that "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.
His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.
The anarcho-communist  <START:person> Joseph Déjacque <END>  was the first person to describe himself as "libertarian".
Unlike  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END> , he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature."
In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher  <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  published the book, "The Ego and Its Own," which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism.
French anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included  <START:person> Anselme Bellegarrigue <END> ,  <START:person> Ernest Coeurderoy <END> ,  <START:person> Joseph Déjacque <END>  and  <START:person> Pierre Joseph Proudhon <END> .
First International and the Paris Commune.
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.
After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.
In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal "El Porvenir" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by  <START:person> Proudhon <END> ´s ideas.
The Catalan politician  <START:person> Francesc Pi i Margall <END>  became the principal translator of  <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party.
According to  <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's."
According to the "Encyclopedia Britannica" "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y  <START:person> Margall <END>  attempted to establish a decentralized, or "cantonalist," political system on Proudhonian lines."
In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of  <START:person> Proudhon <END> , Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats.
Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation.
 <START:person> Karl Marx <END>  became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's followers, the mutualists, opposed  <START:person> Marx <END> 's state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.
 <START:person> Woodcock <END>  also reports that the American individualist anarchists  <START:person> Lysander Spooner <END>  and  <START:person> William B. Greene <END>  had been members of the First International.
In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary  <START:person> Mikhail Bakunin <END>  and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).
They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.
At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction.
Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with  <START:person> Marx <END>  and  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  as their respective figureheads.
 <START:person> Bakunin <END>  characterised  <START:person> Marx <END> 's ideas as centralist and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against.
Anarchist historian  <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London.
One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's Swiss supporters.
Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously.
Most of them were clearly directed against  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  and his followers."
In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  and  <START:person> James Guillaume <END>  were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.
In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.
The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871.
The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War.
Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune.
They included  <START:person> Louise Michel <END> , the Reclus brothers, and  <START:person> Eugene Varlin <END>  (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards).
As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised ...
Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  on French radical ideas.
Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's and  <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's ideas ( <START:person> Proudhon <END> , like  <START:person> Bakunin <END> , had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 ... and for federation of communes).
Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.
 <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  states: a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organisation of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists  <START:person> Courbet <END> ,  <START:person> Longuet <END> , and  <START:person> Vermorel <END> , the libertarian collectivists Varlin,  <START:person> Malon <END> , and  <START:person> Lefrangais <END> , and the bakuninists  <START:person> Elie <END>  and  <START:person> Elisée Reclus <END>  and  <START:person> Louise Michel <END> .
Organised labour.
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organisation of labour."
In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.
In response, unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event.
On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.
The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.
A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.
In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.
Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.
Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer.
The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement.
Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution.
The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day.
In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made.
The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.
Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.
In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including  <START:person> Errico Malatesta <END> ,  <START:person> Pierre Monatte <END> ,  <START:person> Luigi Fabbri <END> ,  <START:person> Benoît Broutchoux <END> ,  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> ,  <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END> , and  <START:person> Christiaan Cornelissen <END> .
Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism.
A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism).
 <START:person> Malatesta <END>  and  <START:person> Monatte <END>  were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while  <START:person> Malatesta <END>  did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.
He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials.
 <START:person> Malatesta <END>  warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain.
The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.
Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War.
The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America.
In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation.
The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions."
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism.
Some anarchists, such as  <START:person> Johann Most <END> , advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda."
By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, regicides, and tyrannicides.
From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal 'expropriations'."
Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society.
Moreover, they were clearly meant to be "exemplary" invitations to revolt.".
France's  <START:person> Bonnot Gang <END>  was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts.
 <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END>  thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite".
A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement.
The anarcho-syndicalist,  <START:person> Fernand Pelloutier <END> , argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."
State repression (including the infamous 1894 French "lois scélérates") of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts.
The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many "communards" to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including  <START:person> Tsar Alexander II <END>  of Russia, President  <START:person> Sadi Carnot <END>  of France, Empress  <START:person> Elisabeth <END>  of Austria, King Umberto I of Italy, President  <START:person> William McKinley <END>  of the United States, King  <START:person> Carlos <END>  I of Portugal and King  <START:person> George <END>  I of Greece.
 <START:person> McKinley <END> 's assassin  <START:person> Leon Czolgosz <END>  claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> .
Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the 1917 October Revolution.
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s.
Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.
However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, which the new government repressed.
Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine.
There, in the Free Territory, they fought in the civil war against the Whites (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END> , who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
Expelled American anarchists  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END>  and  <START:person> Alexander Berkman <END>  were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia.
Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised.
For them,  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally.
Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.
In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International.
The revolutionary wave of 1917–23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism.
In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists  <START:person> Gustav Landauer <END> ,  <START:person> Silvio Gesell <END>  and  <START:person> Erich Mühsam <END>  had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures.
In the Italian events known as the "biennio rosso" the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "Umanita Nova", its daily paper) grew accordingly ... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces.
In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist  <START:person> Ricardo Flores Magón <END> .
In Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END> , concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.
Their 1926 manifesto, called the "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)", was supported.
Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America.
Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.
In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents  <START:person> Volin <END>  and  <START:person> Sebastien Faure <END> .
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Conflicts with European fascist regimes.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state.
Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists.
Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation "Arditi del Popolo", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922.
The veteran Italian anarchist,  <START:person> Luigi Fabbri <END> , was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution."
In France, where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy.
Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II.
In Germany the anarchist  <START:person> Erich Mühsam <END>  was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin.
 <START:person> Joseph Goebbels <END> , the Nazi propaganda minister, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives."
Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg, Brandenburg and finally, Oranienburg.
On 2 February 1934,  <START:person> Mühsam <END>  was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934,  <START:person> Mühsam <END>  was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
Spanish Revolution.
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory.
But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power.
Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).
In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land.
But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union.
The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante.
Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment.
Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes.
Anarchist historian  <START:person> Sam Dolgoff <END>  estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists.
The prominent Italian anarchist  <START:person> Camillo Berneri <END> , who volunteered to fight against  <START:person> Franco <END>  was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party.
Post-war years.
Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France.
The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District.
In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association).
From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.
In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist  <START:person> Federazione Anarchica Italiana <END>  was founded in Italy.
Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded.
An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948.
After World War II, an appeal in the "Fraye Arbeter Shtime" detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them.
By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation.
The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and  <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END>  wrote for its organ, "Die Freie Gesellschaft", which survived until 1953.
In 1956 the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded.
In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation.
The Syndicalist Workers' Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of Solidarity Federation's earliest predecessors.
It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain.
Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as  <START:person> Albert Camus <END> ,  <START:person> Herbert Read <END> ,  <START:person> Paul Goodman <END> ,  <START:person> Dwight Macdonald <END> ,  <START:person> Allen Ginsberg <END> ,  <START:person> George Woodcock <END> ,  <START:person> Leopold Kohr <END> ,  <START:person> Julian Beck <END> ,  <START:person> John Cage <END>  and the French Surrealist group led by  <START:person> André Breton <END> , which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.
Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists  <START:person> Ammon Hennacy <END>  and  <START:person> Dorothy Day <END> .
Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War."
The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in  <START:person> Robert Graham <END> 's , "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".
Contemporary anarchism.
A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s.
Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts.
In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the Fédération Anarchiste), the  <START:person> Federazione Anarchica Italiana <END>  of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.
In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols.
The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain.
In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.
Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged.
Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s.
Anarchist anthropologist  <START:person> David Graeber <END>  and anarchist historian  <START:person> Andrej Grubacic <END>  have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous, feminist, ecological and cultural-critical ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.
Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.
Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight, and the World Economic Forum.
Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police.
These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as "black blocs"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.
A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999.
According to anarchist scholar  <START:person> Simon Critchley <END> , "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism ...
One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."
International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity.
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT.
CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.
Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation; the CNT-AIT in France; the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy; in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation.
The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World, claiming 2,000 paying members, and the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.
Anarchist schools of thought.
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist anarchism and social anarchism, which have some different origins, values and evolution.
The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty, i.e. opposition to state or social control over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, "recognizing equality of entitlement".
In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.
A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.
One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "anarchism without adjectives", a call for toleration first adopted by  <START:person> Fernando Tarrida del Mármol <END>  in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time.
In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e.
collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
Classical anarchist schools of thought.
Mutualism.
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END>  in France and others in the United States.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order."
It is important to recognize that  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance.
For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance,  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform.
According to the American mutualist  <START:person> William Batchelder Greene <END> , each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount."
Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."
Individualist anarchism.
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.
Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.
In 1793,  <START:person> William Godwin <END> , who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote "Political Justice", which some consider the first expression of anarchism.
 <START:person> Godwin <END> , a philosophical anarchist, from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.
An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German  <START:person> Max Stirner <END> .
 <START:person> Stirner <END> 's "The Ego and Its Own", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.
According to  <START:person> Stirner <END> , the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality.
To Stirner, rights were "spooks" in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality".
 <START:person> Stirner <END>  advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which  <START:person> Stirner <END>  proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state.
Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.
"Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of  <START:person> Stirner <END> 's philosophy.
It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist  <START:person> John Henry Mackay <END> .
 <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical published.
For American anarchist historian  <START:person> Eunice Minette Schuster <END>  "It is apparent ... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  and  <START:person> Stephen Pearl Andrews <END>  ...  <START:person> William B. Greene <END>  presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.".  <START:person> Henry David Thoreau <END>  (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe.
 <START:person> Thoreau <END>  was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist.
He is best known for his books "Walden", a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, "Civil Disobedience", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.
Later  <START:person> Benjamin Tucker <END>  fused  <START:person> Stirner <END> 's egoism with the economics of  <START:person> Warren <END>  and  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  in his eclectic influential publication "Liberty".
From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, free love and birth control advocates (see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex), individualist naturists nudists (see anarcho-naturism), freethought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation (see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France).
These authors and activists included  <START:person> Oscar Wilde <END> ,  <START:person> Emile Armand <END> ,  <START:person> Han Ryner <END> ,  <START:person> Henri Zisly <END> ,  <START:person> Renzo Novatore <END> ,  <START:person> Miguel Gimenez Igualada <END> ,  <START:person> Adolf Brand <END>  and  <START:person> Lev Chernyi <END>  among others.
Social anarchism.
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or coercion.
It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.
Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for personal property), and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid.
Collectivist anarchism.
Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with  <START:person> Mikhail Bakunin <END>  and  <START:person> Johann Most <END> .
Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised.
This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "propaganda by the deed", which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.
However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism.
This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system".
Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.
Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
Anarcho-communism.
Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, markets, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".
Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.
Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.
Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International.
The theoretical work of  <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END>  took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections.
To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution.
Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war,  <START:person> Hitler <END> ,  <START:person> Mussolini <END> , Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself.
During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END>  worked to create and defend – through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine – anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.
Anarcho-syndicalism. Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement.
Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.
The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' solidarity, Direct action and Workers' self-management Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.
Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing.
They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.
 <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END>  was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.
He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-Syndicalism".
The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries.
The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement.
It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.
Post-classical schools of thought.
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.
Green anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism, and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology.
Anarcha-feminism (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism.
It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association.
Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state.
In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa.
 <START:person> L. Susan Brown <END>  claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".
Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END>  and  <START:person> Voltairine de Cleyre <END> .
Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see non-violence).
It developed "mostly in the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War".
Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity.
Its main proponents included  <START:person> Leo Tolstoy <END> ,  <START:person> Dorothy Day <END> ,  <START:person> Ammon Hennacy <END> , and  <START:person> Jacques Ellul <END> .
Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of  <START:person> Dielo Truda <END> 's "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)".
The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups.
The "Platform" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.
Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.
In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists Voline and  <START:person> Sébastien Faure <END> .
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional Left-wing politics.
Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality.
Influenced by the work of  <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  and by the Marxist Situationist International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice.
It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses.
Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation.
Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.
Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism, autonomist marxism, post-left anarchy, Situationist International, and postcolonialism.
Left-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.
Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market.
Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics, study of law and economics, and public choice theory.
There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.
Internal issues and debates.
Anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common.
The compatibility of capitalism, nationalism, and religion with anarchism is widely disputed.
Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism, communism and capitalism.
Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.
Phenomena such as civilization, technology (e.g.
within anarcho-primitivism and insurrectionary anarchism), and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.
On a tactical level, while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the Nihilist movement), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence, counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society.
About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.
The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory.
Topics of interest.
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
Free love.
An important current within anarchism is free love.
Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty.
Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.
The most important American free love journal was "Lucifer the Lightbearer" (1883–1907) edited by  <START:person> Moses Harman <END>  and  <START:person> Lois Waisbrooker <END> , but also there existed  <START:person> Ezra Heywood <END>  and  <START:person> Angela Heywood <END> 's "The Word" (1872–1890, 1892–1893).
"Free Society" (1895–1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897–1904 as "Free Society") was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.
The publication advocated free love and women's rights, and critiqued "Comstockery" – censorship of sexual information.
Also  <START:person> M. E. Lazarus <END>  was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.
In New York City's Greenwich Village, bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now.
They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical  <START:person> Edna St. Vincent Millay <END>  and the lesbian anarchist  <START:person> Margaret Anderson <END>  were prominent among them.
Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> , among others.
 <START:person> Magnus Hirschfeld <END>  noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights.
Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public."
In fact, before Goldman, heterosexual anarchist  <START:person> Robert Reitzel <END>  (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal "Der arme  <START:person> Teufel <END> ".
In Argentina anarcha-feminist  <START:person> Virginia Bolten <END>  published the newspaper called "La Voz de la Mujer" (English: The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in  <START:person> Rosario <END>  between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.
In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was  <START:person> Emile Armand <END> .
He proposed the concept of "la camaraderie amoureuse" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults.
He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory.
In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and  <START:person> John Henry Mackay <END>  were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.
 <START:person> Mujeres Libres <END>  was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women.
It was founded in 1936 by  <START:person> Lucía Sánchez Saornil <END> , Mercedes Comaposada and  <START:person> Amparo Poch <END>  y Gascón and had approximately 30,000 members.
The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for women's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel.
In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.
 <START:person> Lucía Sánchez Saornil <END>  was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation  <START:person> Mujeres Libres <END>  who was open about her lesbianism.
She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment.
More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual "The Joy of Sex".
The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-hedonist philosopher  <START:person> Michel Onfray <END>  in such works as "Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire" (2000) and "L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques" (2002).
Libertarian education and freethought.
For English anarchist  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  education was "the main means by which change would be achieved."
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.
For  <START:person> Godwin <END>  education had to have "A respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion," "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives," and "A concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school."
In his "Political Justice" he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government".
Early American anarchist  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established.
 <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called "The False Principle of our Education".
In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation.
Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".
In the United States "freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters.
A number of contributors to "Liberty" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism.
The individualist anarchist  <START:person> George MacDonald <END>  was a co-editor of "Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker".
 <START:person> E.C. Walker <END>  was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer"".
"Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer", "Freethought" and "The Truth Seeker" appeared in "Liberty"...
The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".
In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker  <START:person> Francesc Ferrer <END>  i Guàrdia established "modern" or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.
The schools' stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting".
Fiercely anti-clerical,  <START:person> Ferrer <END>  believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.
 <START:person> Murray Bookchin <END>  wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence.
Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was  <START:person> Francisco Ferrer <END> 's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally."
 <START:person> La Escuela Moderna <END> , and  <START:person> Ferrer <END> 's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of "Modern Schools" in the United States, Cuba, South America and London.
The first of these was started in New York City in 1911.
It also inspired the Italian newspaper "Università popolare", founded in 1901.
Russian christian anarchist  <START:person> Leo Tolstoy <END>  established a school for peasant children on his estate.
 <START:person> Tolstoy <END> 's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.
 <START:person> Tolstoy <END>  established a conceptual difference between education and culture.
He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free.
[Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".
For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".
A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches.
Experiments in Germany led to  <START:person> A. S. Neill <END>  founding what became Summerhill School in 1921.
Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.
However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of  <START:person> Ferrer <END>  by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se.
The term deschooling was popularised by  <START:person> Ivan Illich <END> , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms.
Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics.
European history professor  <START:person> Carl Landauer <END> , in his book "European Socialism" argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force."
He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity."
Acid  An acid (from the Latin "acidus/acēre" meaning "sour") is a chemical substance whose aqueous solutions are characterized by a sour taste, the ability to turn blue litmus red, and the ability to react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. Aqueous solutions of acids have a pH of less than 7. Non-aqueous acids are usually formed when an anion reacts with one or more positively charged hydrogen cations.
A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution.
Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic.
There are three common definitions for acids: the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition, and the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  definition.
The  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+), or more accurately, hydronium ions (H3O+), when dissolved in water.
The Brønsted-Lowry definition is an expansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor.
By this definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid.
Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or N-H fragments.
A  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid is a substance that can accept a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond.
Examples of  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids include all metal cations, and electron-deficient molecules such as boron trifluoride and aluminium trichloride.
Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and tartaric acid (a solid used in baking).
As these examples show, acids can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from solids, liquids, or gases.
Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.
Definitions and concepts.
Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.
Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions, or can be dissolved in water, so the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant.
The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified, acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H+) from an acid to a base.
Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions.
Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as  <START:person> Lewis <END>  bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
 <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acids.
The Swedish chemist  <START:person> Svante Arrhenius <END>  attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions (H+) or protons in 1884.
An  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water.
Note that chemists often write H+("aq") and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a proton, does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H3O+.
Thus, an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water.
This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and hydroxide (OH−) ions: In pure water the majority of molecules are H2O, but the molecules are constantly dissociating and re-associating, and at any time a small number of the molecules are hydronium and an equal number are hydroxide.
Because the numbers are equal, pure water is neutral (not acidic or basic).
An  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  base, on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water, hence decreasing the concentration of hydronium.
The constant association and disassociation of H2O molecules forms an equilibrium in which any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide, thus an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, with an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  base increasing it.
In an acid, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10−7 moles per liter.
Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have a pH of less than 7. Brønsted-Lowry acids.
While the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope.
In 1923 chemists  <START:person> Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Martin Lowry <END>  independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton.
A Brønsted-Lowry acid (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base.
Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  theory.
Consider the following reactions of acetic acid (CH3COOH), the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste: Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CH3COOH acts as an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid because it acts as a source of H3O+ when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water.
In the second example CH3COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH3), but cannot be described using the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium.
Brønsted-Lowry theory can also be used to describe molecular compounds, whereas  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acids must be ionic compounds.
Hydrogen chloride (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride, NH4Cl.
In aqueous solution HCl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions.
The following reactions illustrate the limitations of  <START:person> Arrhenius <END> 's definition: As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute.
The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions.
In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in benzene) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH3 combine to form the solid.
 <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids.
A third concept was proposed in 1923 by  <START:person> Gilbert N. Lewis <END>  which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer.
A  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.
Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers.
All Brønsted acids are also  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids, but not all  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids are Brønsted acids.
Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry.
In the first reaction a fluoride ion, F−, gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate.
Fluoride "loses" a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion.
BF3 is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride.
This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer.
The second reaction can be described using either theory.
A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a  <START:person> Lewis <END>  base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion.
The species that gains the electron pair is the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H3O+ gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen.
Depending on the context, a  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile.
Dissociation and equilibrium.
Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA H+ + A−, where HA represents the acid and A− is the conjugate base.
Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton (protonation and deprotonation, respectively).
Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA+ H+ + A. In solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base.
The equilibrium constant "K" is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution.
Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H2O] means "the concentration of H2O".
The acid dissociation constant "K"a is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions.
The numerical value of "K"a is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H+.
The stronger of two acids will have a higher "K"a than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton.
Because the range of possible values for "K"a spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p"K"a is more frequently used, where p"K"a = -log10 "K"a.
Stronger acids have a smaller p"K"a than weaker acids.
Experimentally determined p"K"a at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.
Nomenclature.
In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their anions.
That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.
For example, HCl has chloride as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid.
In the IUPAC naming system, "aqueous" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound.
Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride.
The prefix "hydro-" is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.
Classical naming system: Acid strength.
The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton.
A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA.
In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution.
Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%.
The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+.
Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond.
Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.
Stronger acids have a larger "K"a and a more negative p"K"a than weaker acids.
Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids.
A common example is toluenesulfonic acid (tosylic acid).
Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids.
In fact, polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.
Superacids are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid.
Examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid, magic acid and perchloric acid.
Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline hydronium "salts".
They can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations.
While "K"a measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.
The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's "K"a.
Chemical characteristics.
Monoprotic acids.
Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA): Common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO3).
On the other hand, for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid.
Examples in organic acids include formic acid (HCOOH), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and benzoic acid (C6H5COOH).
Polyprotic acids.
Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule.
Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).
A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H2A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH.
Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, Ka1 and Ka2.
The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., "K"a1 > "K"a2.
For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion (HSO4−), for which "K"a1 is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion (SO42−), wherein the "K"a2 is intermediate strength.
The large "K"a1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid.
In a similar manner, the weak unstable carbonic acid (H2CO3) can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) and lose a second to form carbonate anion (CO32−).
Both "K"a values are small, but "K"a1 > "K"a2 .
A triprotic acid (H3A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where "K"a1 > "K"a2 > "K"a3.
An inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4), usually just called phosphoric acid.
All three protons can be successively lost to yield H2PO4−, then HPO42−, and finally PO43−, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called phosphate.
Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive "K"a values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.
An organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid, which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion.
Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution.
The fractional concentration, "α" (alpha), for each species can be calculated.
For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H2A, HA−, and A2−.
The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H+]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases: A plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given "K"1 and "K"2, is known as a Bjerrum plot.
A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general "n" -protic acid that has been deprotonated "i" -times: where K0 = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.
Neutralization.
Neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a salt and neutralized base; for example, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water: Neutralization is the basis of titration, where a pH indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid.
It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.
Neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt.
An example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride, which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia.
Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g.
sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide.
Weak acid–weak base equilibrium.
In order for a protonated acid to lose a proton, the pH of the system must rise above the p"K"a of the acid.
The decreased concentration of H+ in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid).
In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H+ concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form.
Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions.
Applications of acids.
There are numerous uses for acids.
Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling.
They may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery, such as sulfuric acid in a car battery.
Strong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing.
For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.
In the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts.
For example, nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer.
Additionally, carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols, to produce esters.
Acids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives.
Phosphoric acid, for example, is a component of cola drinks.
Acetic acid is used in day-to-day life as vinegar.
Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.
Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.
Tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind.
Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids.
Citric acid is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits.
Oxalic acid is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in carambola and rhubarb; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.
Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla (Indian gooseberry), lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.
Certain acids are used as drugs.
Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.
Acids play important roles in the human body.
The hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules.
Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues.
Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues.
Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA and RNA and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes.
Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.
Acid catalysis.
Acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline.
Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions.
In biochemistry, many enzymes employ acid catalysis.
Biological occurrence.
Many biologically important molecules are acids.
Nucleic acids, which contain acidic phosphate groups, include DNA and RNA.
Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring.
DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits.
Cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids.
An α-amino acid has a central carbon (the α or "alpha" carbon) which is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group (thus they are carboxylic acids), an amino group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group.
The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid.
In glycine, the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen.
With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the .
Peptidoglycan, found in some bacterial cell walls contains some -amino acids.
At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO−) and the basic amine group (-NH2) gains a proton (-NH3+).
The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion, with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains.
Aspartic acid, for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of −1 at physiological pH.
Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology.
These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end.
The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer, a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic phosphate "head" groups.
Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.
In humans and many other animals, hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, pepsinogen into the enzyme, pepsin.
Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce formic acid.
Acid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing.
Oxygen gas (O2) drives cellular respiration, the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food, producing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs, and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation.
For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat, releasing CO2 into the blood stream.
In aqueous solutions such as blood CO2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion.
It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO2 and resupplying the cells with O2.  Cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior.
Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base).
For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods.
The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and cytosol, both aqueous environments.
When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer.
Acids that lose a proton at the intracellular pH will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target.
Ibuprofen, aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids.
Common acids.
Sulfonic acids.
A sulfonic acid has the general formula RS(=O)2–OH, where R is an organic radical.
Carboxylic acids.
A carboxylic acid has the general formula R-C(O)OH, where R is an organic radical.
The carboxyl group -C(O)OH contains a carbonyl group, C=O, and a hydroxyl group, O-H.
Halogenated carboxylic acids.
Halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength, so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid.
Vinylogous carboxylic acids.
Normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group.
In vinylogous carboxylic acids, a carbon-carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.
Adventure  An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.
It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.
Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.
The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.
Motivation.
Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g.
fear) or positive (e.g.
flow), and which can be detrimental as stated by the Yerkes-Dodson law.
For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself.
According to adventurer  <START:person> André Malraux <END> , in his "La Condition Humaine" (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".
Similarly,  <START:person> Helen Keller <END>  stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."
Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism.
Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer  <START:person> Jason Lewis <END> , for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren.
Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.
Adventure in mythology.
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's "The Odyssey".
Mythologist  <START:person> Joseph Campbell <END>  discussed his notion of the monomyth in his book, "The Hero with a Thousand Faces".
 <START:person> Campbell <END>  proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.
The knight errant was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.
The adventure novel exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as "Star Wars" and "The Raiders of the Lost Ark".
Articles of Confederation  The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was a document signed amongst the thirteen original colonies that established the United States of America as a confederation of sovereign states and served as its first constitution.
Its drafting by a committee appointed by the Second Continental Congress began on July 12, 1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for ratification in late 1777.
The formal ratification by all thirteen states was completed in early 1781.
Even when not yet ratified, the Articles provided domestic and international legitimacy for the Continental Congress to direct the American Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with Europe and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations.
Nevertheless, the weakness of the government created by the Articles became a matter of concern for key nationalists.
On March 4, 1789, the general government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the United States Constitution.
The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government with a chief executive (the president), courts, and taxing powers.
Background and context.
The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and  <START:person> Benjamin Franklin <END> 's proposed Albany Plan of Union, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems.
The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it.
Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown.
With civil disobedience resulting in coercive and intolerable acts, and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it.
In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government to run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence.
It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not.
During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority.
It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.
To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it.
In early 1776,  <START:person> Thomas Paine <END>  argued in the closing pages of the first edition of "Common Sense" that the “custom of nations” demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain.
The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch.
Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a “manifesto” which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners.
Without such a declaration,  <START:person> Paine <END>  concluded, “[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.”
Beyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations.
On June 7, 1776,  <START:person> Richard Henry Lee <END>  introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve “to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances” and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states.
Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation.
The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established “a firm league” among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.
Drafting.
On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.
The committee met repeatedly, and chairman  <START:person> John Dickinson <END>  presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776.
There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures.
The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.
In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777; the final draft of the Articles served as the de facto system of government used by the Congress ("the United States in Congress assembled") until it became de jure by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the Congress of the Confederation.
Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government.
The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government.
It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories.
Article XIII stipulated that "their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state" and "the Union shall be perpetual".
 <START:person> John Dickinson <END> 's and  <START:person> Benjamin Franklin <END> 's handwritten drafts of the Articles of Confederation are housed at the National Archives in Washington, DC.
Operation.
The Articles were created by delegates from the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a need to have "a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States."
After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government.
There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base.
The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.
In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the United States Constitution and the new government began operations in 1789.
Ratification.
Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777: "Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states.
Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties..." The document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all 13 states.
The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777; the thirteenth state to ratify was Maryland on February 2, 1781.
A ceremonial confirmation of this thirteenth, final ratification took place in the Congress on March 1, 1781 at high noon.
Dates of ratification are: The ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by the refusal of some states to rescind their claims to land in the West.
Maryland was the last holdout; it refused to go along until Virginia and New York agreed to cede their claims in the Ohio River Valley.
It took a little over three years for all states to ratify.
The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of Province of Quebec (referred to as "Canada" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so.
It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission.
Article summaries.
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people, the two documents are very different.
Stylistically, the Articles are more wordy, less straightforward and less quotable than the Constitution.
Functionally, they lay out very different forms of government.
The original five-page Articles contained a preamble, 13 articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.
The preamble states that the signatory states "agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union" between the 13 states.
The following list contains short summaries of each of the 13 articles.
While still at war with Britain, the Founding Fathers were divided between those seeking a powerful, centralized national government (the "federalists"), and those seeking a loosely structured one (the "anti federalists").
Jealously guarding their new independence, members of the Continental Congress arrived at a compromise solution dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states.
While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism with which to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or revenue.
At times, this left the military without adequate funding, supplies or even food.
The end of the Revolutionary War.
The Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it.
Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance.
In September 1783,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  complained that Congress was paralyzed.
Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.
Function.
The Army.
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the Continental Army, and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers.
As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian  <START:person> Bruce Chadwick <END>  wrote:  <START:person> George Washington <END>  had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government.
The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress.
... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states.
Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.
The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life.
However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor.
No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783–84.
General  <START:person> Henry Knox <END> , who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army.
The army had long been supportive of a strong union.
 <START:person> Knox <END>  wrote: The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies.
Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign.
... It is a favorite toast in the army, "A hoop to the barrel" or "Cement to the Union".
As Congress failed to act on the petitions,  <START:person> Knox <END>  wrote to  <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END> , four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, "As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution."
Once the war had been won, the Continental Army was largely disbanded.
A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks.
Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies.
The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met.
In 1783,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  defused the Newburgh conspiracy, but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.
The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states.
Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests.
The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs.
 <START:person> Dougherty <END>  (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis.
This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.
Foreign policy.
Even after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy.
In 1789,  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> , concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates, wrote to  <START:person> James Monroe <END> , "It will be said there is no money in the treasury.
There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth.
The states must see the rod.”
Furthermore, the  <START:person> Jay <END> –Gardoqui Treaty with Spain in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy.
In this treaty — which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity — the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains.
Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil — forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation.
This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris (1783) was superseded by the implementation of  <START:person> Jay <END> 's Treaty in 1795 under the new U.S. Constitution.
Taxation and Commerce.
Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited.
The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers.
Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.
Congress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states.
The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money.
As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated.
In 1779,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  wrote to  <START:person> John Jay <END> , who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, "that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions."
Mr.  <START:person> Jay <END>  and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the States.
In an appeal to the States to comply,  <START:person> Jay <END>  wrote that the taxes were "the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity."
He argued that Americans should avoid having it said "that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent" or that "her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith."
The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.
Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies.
The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War.
Some States paid off their war debts and others did not.
Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.
Accomplishments of the Confederation.
Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact.
The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states, the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use.
This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.
The Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River.
Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the township (36 square miles), the section (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 acres).
This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire).
Then, when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims, organized the Northwest Territory and thus cleared the way for the entry of five new states and part of a sixth to the Union.
To be specific, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia gave up all of their claims to land north of the Ohio River and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania.
Over several decades a number of new states were formed from this land: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River.
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery.
New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.
The United States of America under the Articles.
The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure.
The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced.
There was no president and no national court.
Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.
By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity.
However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires.
The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships.
France and Spain established similar policies.
Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again.
Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution.
The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation.
In 1786–87,  <START:person> Shays <END> ' Rebellion, an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.
The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression "not worth a continental".
Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States.
Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.
When  <START:person> John Adams <END>  went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce.
Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty.
 <START:person> Adams <END>  stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain.
Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws.
Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect.
When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.
By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping.
State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit.
Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.
The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor.
 <START:person> Alexander Hamilton <END>  realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress.
 <START:person> Hamilton <END>  led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.
Signatures.
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777.
A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress.
On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of  <START:person> Henry Laurens <END>  and  <START:person> Charles Thomson <END> , who were the President and Secretary to the Congress.
The "Articles", however, were unsigned, and the date was blank.
Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the "Articles" on June 27, 1778.
They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.
On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready.
They dated it, and began to sign.
They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed.
On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified.
New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified.
North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.
After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended.
For example,  <START:person> John Wentworth <END>  of New Hampshire added his name on August 8.
 <START:person> John Penn <END>  was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the "Articles" on July 21, 1778.
The other states had to wait until they ratified the "Articles" and notified their Congressional delegation.
Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779.
Maryland refused to ratify the "Articles" until every state had ceded its western land claims.
On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis.
As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, "among engrossed Bills" was "signed and sealed by Governor  <START:person> Thomas Sim Lee <END>  in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation" and perpetual union among the states.
The Senate then adjourned "to the first Monday in August next."
The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12.
The confirmation signing of the "Articles" by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon.
With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.
Congress had debated the "Articles" for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years.
Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived.
The "Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union" were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.
Signers.
The signers and the states they represented were:  <START:person> Roger Sherman <END>  (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
 <START:person> Robert Morris <END>  (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
 <START:person> John Dickinson <END>  (Delaware),  <START:person> Daniel Carroll <END>  (Maryland) and  <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END>  (New York), along with  <START:person> Sherman <END>  and  <START:person> Robert Morris <END> , were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution ( <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END>  represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).
Presidents of the Congress.
The following list is of those who led the Congress of the Confederation under the "Articles of Confederation" as the Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled.
Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions.
He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor President of the United States is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.
"For a full list of Presidents of the Congress Assembled and Presidents under the two Continental Congresses before the Articles, see President of the Continental Congress."
Revision and replacement.
On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following  <START:person> James Madison <END> 's recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict.
At what came to be known as the Annapolis Convention, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a "Grand Convention."
Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution.
The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed.
The general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships.
Historian  <START:person> Forrest McDonald <END> , using the ideas of  <START:person> James Madison <END>  from "Federalist 39", describes the change this way: The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun.
Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states.
The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.
In May 1786,  <START:person> Charles Pinckney <END>  of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation.
Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries.
Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus.
The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after  <START:person> Shays <END> ' Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.
Historian  <START:person> Ralph Ketcham <END>  comments on the opinions of  <START:person> Patrick Henry <END> ,  <START:person> George Mason <END> , and other antifederalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution: Antifederalists feared what  <START:person> Patrick Henry <END>  termed the "consolidated government" proposed by the new Constitution.
They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a "splendid empire" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns.
Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.
Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787.
 <START:person> Jillson <END>  and  <START:person> Wilson <END>  (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.
 <START:person> Rakove <END>  (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation.
The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power.
It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island.
 <START:person> Rakove <END>  concludes that their failure to implement national measures "stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace."
The second group of factors  <START:person> Rakove <END>  identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy.
Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.
When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new "merchant state," much like the British state people had rebelled against.
In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims.
Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.
Legitimacy of closing down.
Political scientist  <START:person> David C. Hendrickson <END>  writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation,  <START:person> John Jay <END>  of New York and  <START:person> Thomas Burke <END>  of North Carolina believed that "the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges."
According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously:  [T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.
On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity: The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.
The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.
In 1788,  <START:person> James Madison <END>  remarked (in "Federalist No. 40") that the issue had become moot: "As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation."
Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.
At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.
Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.
Modern scholars such as  <START:person> Francisco Forrest Martin <END>  agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus "other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule".
In contrast, law professor  <START:person> Akhil Amar <END>  suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.
Final months.
According to their terms for modification (Article XIII), the Articles would still have been in effect until 1790, the year in which the last of the 13 states, Rhode Island, ratified the new Constitution.
The Congress under the Articles continued to convene with a quorum until October 1788, overseeing the adoption of the new Constitution by the states, setting elections and attending to other business.
By July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.
On Saturday, September 13, 1788, the Confederation Congress voted the resolve to implement the new Constitution, and on Monday, September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.
On that same September 13, it determined that New York would remain the national capital.

Aikido  Aikido (Japanese: 合気道,  <START:person> Hepburn <END> : Aikidō) ] is a Japanese martial art developed by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and religious beliefs.
Aikido is often translated as "the way of unifying (with) life energy" or as "the way of harmonious spirit."
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury.
Aikido techniques consist of entering and turning movements that redirect the momentum of an opponent's attack, and a throw or joint lock that terminates the technique.
Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's involvement with the Ōmoto-kyō religion.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's early students' documents bear the term "aiki-jūjutsu".
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him.
Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis.
However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.
Etymology and basic philosophy.
The word "aikido" is formed of three kanji: The term "aiki" does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of  <START:person> Budo <END> .
This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.
合 is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being 合同 (combined/united), 合成 (composition), 結合 (unite/combine/join together), 連合 (union/alliance/association), 統合 (combine/unify), and 合意 (mutual agreement).
There is an idea of reciprocity, 知り合う (to get to know one another), 話し合い (talk/discussion/negotiation), and 待ち合わせる (meet by appointment).
気 is often used to describe a feeling, as in なになに気がする ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and 気持ち (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in 電気 (electricity) and 磁気 (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in 気質 (spirit/trait/temperament).
The term dō is also found in martial arts such as judo and kendo, and in various non-martial arts, such as Japanese calligraphy (shodō), flower arranging (kadō) and tea ceremony (chadō or sadō).
Therefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the "Way of combining forces", in that the term aiki refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.
One applies aiki by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.
History.
Aikido was created by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  (植芝 盛平 "Ueshiba Morihei", 14 December 1883 – 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as "Ōsensei" ("Great Teacher").
The term 'aikido' was coined in the twentieth century.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation.
During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the Aiki that  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.
Initial development.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.
The core martial art from which aikido derives is Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu, which  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  studied directly with  <START:person> Takeda Sōkaku <END> , the reviver of that art.
Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied  <START:person> Tenjin Shin <END> 'yō-ryū with  <START:person> Tozawa Tokusaburō <END>  in Tokyo in 1901, Gotōha Yagyū Shingan-ryū under  <START:person> Nakai Masakatsu <END>  in Sakai from 1903 to 1908, and judo with  <START:person> Kiyoichi Takagi <END>  (高木 喜代子 "Takagi Kiyoichi", 1894–1972) in Tanabe in 1911.
The art of Daitō-ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido.
Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the spear ("yari"), short staff ("jō"), and perhaps the bayonet (銃剣, jūken).
However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ("kenjutsu").
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  moved to Hokkaidō in 1912, and began studying under  <START:person> Takeda Sokaku <END>  in 1915.
His official association with Daitō-ryū continued until 1937.
However, during the latter part of that period,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  had already begun to distance himself from  <START:person> Takeda <END>  and the Daitō-ryū.
At that time  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  was referring to his martial art as "Aiki Budō".
It is unclear exactly when  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  began using the name "aikido", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ("Dai Nippon Butoku Kai") was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.
Religious influences.
After  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  left  <START:person> Hokkaidō <END>  in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by  <START:person> Onisaburo Deguchi <END> , the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in  <START:person> Ayabe <END> .
One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life.
This was a great influence on  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others.
Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it.
In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.
In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with  <START:person> Deguchi <END>  gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.
As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students.
Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.
International dissemination.
Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by  <START:person> Minoru Mochizuki <END>  with a visit to France where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students.
He was followed by  <START:person> Tadashi Abe <END>  in 1952 who came as the official Aikikai Hombu representative, remaining in France for seven years.
 <START:person> Kenji Tomiki <END>  toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953.
Later in that year,  <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END>  was sent by  <START:person> Aikikai Hombu <END>  to Hawaii, for a full year, where he set up several dojo.
This was followed up by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States.
The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by  <START:person> Hiroshi Tada <END> ; and Germany 1965 by  <START:person> Katsuaki Asai <END> .
Designated "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa" by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> ,  <START:person> Masamichi Noro <END>  arrived in France in September 1961.
 <START:person> Seiichi Sugano <END>  was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965.
Today there are aikido dojo available throughout the world.
Proliferation of independent organizations.
The largest aikido organization is the Aikikai Foundation, which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family.
However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> 's major students.
The earliest independent styles to emerge were Yoseikan Aikido, begun by  <START:person> Minoru Mochizuki <END>  in 1931, Yoshinkan Aikido founded by  <START:person> Gozo Shioda <END>  in 1955, and Shodokan Aikido, founded by  <START:person> Kenji Tomiki <END>  in 1967.
The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized.
Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.
After  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged.
Significant controversy arose with the departure of the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief instructor  <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END> , in 1974.
 <START:person> Tohei <END>  left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder,  <START:person> Kisshomaru Ueshiba <END> , who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation.
The disagreement was over the proper role of "ki" development in regular aikido training.
After  <START:person> Tohei <END>  left, he formed his own style, called  <START:person> Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido <END> , and the organization which governs it, the Ki Society ("Ki no Kenkyūkai").
A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in Iwama, Ibaraki, and the teaching methodology of long term student  <START:person> Morihiro Saito <END> .
It is unofficially referred to as the "Iwama style", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called  <START:person> Iwama Ryu <END> .
Although  <START:person> Iwama <END>  style practitioners remained part of the  <START:person> Aikikai <END>  until  <START:person> Saito <END> 's death in 2002, followers of  <START:person> Saito <END>  subsequently split into two groups; one remaining with the  <START:person> Aikikai <END>  and the other forming the independent Shinshin Aikishuren Kai in 2004 around  <START:person> Saito <END> 's son  <START:person> Hitohiro Saito <END> .
Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own headquarters (本部道場, honbu dōjō) in Japan, and have an international breadth.
Ki.
The study of "ki" is a critical component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses both.
The original "kanji" for "ki" was 氣, and is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice; the "nourishing vapors" contained within are "ki".
The character for "ki" is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as "health" (元気, genki), or "shyness" (内気, uchiki).
"Ki" is most often understood as unified physical and mental intention, however in traditional martial arts it is often discussed as "life energy".
 <START:person> Gōzō Shioda <END> 's Yoshinkan Aikido, considered one of the "hard styles," largely follows  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to "ki" lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.
In later years,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's application of "ki" in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel.
This was his  <START:person> Takemusu Aiki <END>  and many of his later students teach about "ki" from this perspective.
 <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END> 's Ki Society centers almost exclusively around the study of the empirical (albeit subjective) experience of "ki" with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and "ki" development.
Training.
In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training.
The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques.
Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll.
The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins.
After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.
Fitness.
Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training.
In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements.
This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.
In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power.
Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates.
For example, many dojos begin each class with warm-up exercises (準備体操, "junbi taisō"), which may include stretching and ukemi (break falls).
Roles of "uke" and "tori".
Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms ("kata") rather than freestyle practice.
The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique ("uke") to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the 取り "tori", or "shite" 仕手 (depending on aikido style), also referred to as 投げ "nage" (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.
Both halves of the technique, that of "uke" and that of "nage", are considered essential to aikido training.
Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation.
"Nage" learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while "uke" learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which "nage" places them.
This "receiving" of the technique is called "ukemi".
"Uke" continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while "nage" uses position and timing to keep "uke" off-balance and vulnerable.
In more advanced training, "uke" will sometimes apply reversal techniques (返し技, kaeshi-waza) to regain balance and pin or throw "nage".
"Ukemi" (受身) refers to the act of receiving a technique.
Good "ukemi" involves attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment—it is an active rather than a passive receiving of aikido.
The fall itself is part of aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, what would otherwise be a devastating strike or throw.
Initial attacks.
Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner.
Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.
Many of the strikes (打ち, uchi) of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for armed combat.
Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches ("tsuki"), are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword.
Kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.
Some basic strikes include: Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike.
Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.
The following are examples of some basic grabs: Basic techniques.
The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins.
Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> .
The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation.
Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.
Implementations.
Aikido makes use of body movement ("tai sabaki") to blend with "uke".
For example, an "entering" ("irimi") technique consists of movements inward towards "uke", while a "turning" (転換, tenkan) technique uses a pivoting motion.
Additionally, an "inside" (内, uchi) technique takes place in front of "uke", whereas an "outside" (外, soto) technique takes place to his side; a "front" (表, omote) technique is applied with motion to the front of "uke", and a "rear" (裏, ura) version is applied with motion towards the rear of "uke", usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion.
Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture ("seiza").
Techniques where both "uke" and "nage" are standing are called "tachi-waza", techniques where both start off in "seiza" are called "suwari-waza", and techniques performed with "uke" standing and "nage" sitting are called "hanmi handachi".
Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations.
For instance, "ikkyō" can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an "ura" type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an "omote-waza" version).
Specific aikido "kata" are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)".
For instance, "katate-dori ikkyō" refers to any "ikkyō" technique executed when "uke" is holding one wrist.
This could be further specified as "katate-dori ikkyō omote", referring to any forward-moving "ikkyō" technique from that grab.
"Atemi" (当て身) are strikes (or feints) employed during an aikido technique.
Some view "atemi" as attacks against "vital points" meant to cause damage in and of themselves.
For instance,  <START:person> Gōzō Shioda <END>  described using "atemi" in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.
Others consider "atemi", especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques.
A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration.
The target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.
Many sayings about "atemi" are attributed to  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> , who considered them an essential element of technique.
Weapons.
Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff ("jō"), wooden sword ("bokken"), and knife ("tantō").
Some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques.
Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught.
Some schools, such as the  <START:person> Iwama <END>  style of  <START:person> Morihiro Saito <END> , usually spend substantial time with "bokken" and "jō", practised under the names "aiki-ken", and "aiki-jō", respectively.
The founder developed much of empty-handed aikido from traditional sword and spear movements.
Consequently, the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).
Multiple attackers and "randori".
One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called "taninzudori", or "taninzugake".
Freestyle ("randori", or "jiyūwaza") practice with multiple attackers is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks.
"Randori", literally "chaos", exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.
Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in "randori" training.
For instance, an "ura" technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.
In Shodokan Aikido, "randori" differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will.
In this respect it resembles judo "randori".
Injuries.
In applying a technique during training, it is the responsibility of "nage" to prevent injury to "uke" by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in "ukemi".
Injuries (especially those to the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of "nage" misjudging the ability of "uke" to receive the throw or pin.
A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other.
Soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido, as well as joint strain and stubbed fingers and toes.
Several deaths from aggressive "shihōnage", resulting from head and neck injury, in a Japanese-style hazing context have been reported.
Mental training.
Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.
This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness.
 <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute techniques without hesitation.
As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.
Uniforms and ranking.
Aikido practitioners (commonly called "aikidōka" outside of Japan) generally progress by promotion through a series of "grades" ("kyū"), followed by a series of "degrees" ("dan"), pursuant to formal testing procedures.
Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and black belts to distinguish lower and higher grades, though some use various belt colors.
Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.
Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a "dan" rank unless they are 16 or older.
The uniform worn for practicing aikido ("aikidōgi") is similar to the training uniform ("keikogi") used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.
Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used.
Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.
Most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called a "hakama" (used also in kendo and iaido.)
In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with ("dan") ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a "hakama" regardless of rank.
Criticisms.
The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training.
The attacks initiated by "uke" (and which "nage" must defend against) have been criticized as being "weak," "sloppy," and "little more than caricatures of an attack."
Weak attacks from "uke" allow for a conditioned response from "nage", and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.
To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners.
Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format.
Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.
Another criticism pertains to the shift toward ki as the focus of training.
After the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in  <START:person> Iwama <END>  from 1942 to the mid-1950s, he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido.
As a result, strikes to vital points by "nage", entering ("irimi") and initiation of techniques by "nage", the distinction between "omote" (front side) and "ura" (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.
Lack of training in these areas is thought to lead to an overall loss of effectiveness by some aikido practitioners.
Conversely, some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> .
The premise of this criticism is that "O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts."
That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional "jujutsu" or "kenjutsu" are diverging from what  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  taught.
Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that "[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals ["sic"] of the paradigm that he demonstrated."
Aquarius (constellation)  Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces.
Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its symbol is (Unicode ♒), a representation of water.
Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the sun's apparent path).
It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer  <START:person> Ptolemy <END> , and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.
It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish, and Eridanus the river.
History and mythology.
Aquarius is identified as GU.LA "The Great One" in the Babylonian star catalogues and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase.
The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium.
It contained the winter solstice in the Early Bronze Age.
In Old Babylonian astronomy,  <START:person> Ea <END>  was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun's path, the "Way of Ea", corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice.
Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negatively connoted.
In Ancient Egypt, Aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the Nile; the banks were said to flood when  <START:person> Aquarius <END>  put his jar into the river, beginning spring.
In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to  <START:person> Piscis Austrinus <END> .
The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise "kumbha" "water-pitcher", showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek intermediaries.
In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with  <START:person> Troy <END> .
The myth has is that a young boy named Ganymede was out tending to his fathers sheep when  <START:person> Zeus <END>  took interest in this young beautiful boy.
 <START:person> Zeus <END>  then turned himself into an eagle and carried Ganymede to Mount Ide where Ganymede would have to serve drinks to Zeus.
But one day, Ganymede didn't want to serve drinks anymore, so he poured out Zeus wine and water which caused a great flood.
It was then said instead of Zeus getting mad he gave Ganymede immortality and gave him the constellation Aquarius.
In non-Western astronomy.
In Chinese astronomy, the stream of water flowing from the Water Jar was depicted as the "Army of Yu-Lin" ("Yu-lin-kiun" or "Yulinjun").
The name "Yu-lin" means "feathers and forests", referring to the numerous light-footed soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars.
The constellation's stars were the most numerous of any Chinese constellation, numbering 45, the majority of which were located in modern Aquarius.
The celestial army was protected by the wall "Leibizhen", which counted Iota, Lambda, Phi, and Sigma Aquarii among its 12 stars.
88, 89, and 98 Aquarii represent "Fou-youe", the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions.
Also in Aquarius is "Loui-pi-tchin", the ramparts that stretch from 29 and 27 Piscium and 33 and 30 Aquarii through Phi, Lambda, Sigma, and  <START:person> Iota Aquarii <END>  to Delta, Gamma, Kappa, and Epsilon Capricorni.
Near the border with Cetus, the axe "Fuyue" was represented by three stars; its position is disputed and may have instead been located in Sculptor.
"Tienliecheng" also has a disputed position; the 13-star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed Nu and Xi Aquarii but may instead have been located south in Piscis Austrinus.
The Water Jar asterism was seen to the ancient Chinese as the tomb, "Fenmu".
Nearby, the emperors' mausoleum "Xiuliang" stood, demarcated by  <START:person> Kappa Aquarii <END>  and three other collinear stars.
"Ku" ("crying") and "Qi" ("weeping"), each composed of two stars, were located in the same region.
Three of the Chinese lunar mansions shared their name with constellations.
"Nu", also the name for the 10th lunar mansion, was a handmaiden represented by Epsilon, Mu, 3, and 4 Aquarii.
The 11th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation "Xu" ("emptiness"), formed by Beta Aquarii and Alpha Equulei; it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals.
"Wei", the rooftop and 12th lunar mansion, was a V-shaped constellation formed by Alpha Aquarii, Theta Pegasi, and Epsilon Pegasi; it shared its name with two other Chinese constellations, in modern-day Scorpius and Aries.
Depictions.
In the first century CE,  <START:person> Ptolemy <END> 's "Almagest" established the common Western depiction of Aquarius.
His water jar, an asterism itself, consists of Gamma, Pi, Eta, and Zeta Aquarii; it pours water in a stream of more than 20 stars terminating with Fomalhaut, now assigned solely to  <START:person> Piscis Austrinus <END> .
The water bearer's head is represented by 5th magnitude 25 Aquarii while his left shoulder is Beta Aquarii; his right shoulder and forearm are represented by Alpha and  <START:person> Gamma Aquarii <END>  respectively.
Notable features.
Stars.
Despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size, Aquarius has no particularly bright stars, with its 4 brightest stars less than magnitude 2. However, recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems.
α Aquarii, also known as  <START:person> Sadalmelik <END> , is a G2 spectral class star (yellow supergiant) named in Arabic for the phrase "the lucky stars of the king".
It is the second brightest star in Aquarius with a magnitude of 2.96 (though it has an absolute magnitude of -4.5) and is 523 light-years from Earth.
It has a luminosity of 5250 L☉.
β Aquarii, sometimes called Sadalsuud, is a G0 spectral class star (yellow supergiant) named for the Arabic phrase meaning "luckiest of the lucky stars".
It is the brightest star in Aquarius with an apparent magnitude of 2.91 and an absolute magnitude of -4.5.
Sadalsuud is 537 light-years from Earth and has a luminosity of 5250 L☉, the same as α Aquarii.
γ Aquarii, also called Sadachbia, is a blue-white A0 spectral class star of magnitude 3.84 and a luminosity of 50 L☉ that is 163 light years away.
It has a luminosity of 50 L☉.
The name  <START:person> Sadachbia <END>  comes from the Arabic for "lucky stars of the tents", "sa'd al-akhbiya".
δ Aquarii, also known as  <START:person> Scheat <END>  or Skat, is a blue-white A2 spectral class star of magnitude 3.27 and luminosity of 105 L☉.
ε Aquarii, also known as Albali, is a blue-white A1 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 3.77, an absolute magnitude of 1.2, and a luminosity of 28 L☉.
ζ Aquarii is an F2 spectral class double star; both stars are white.
Overall, it appears to be of magnitude 3.6 and luminosity of 50 L☉.
The primary has a magnitude of 4.53 and the secondary a magnitude of 4.31, but both have an absolute magnitude of 0.6.
Its orbital period is 760 years; the two components are currently moving farther apart.
θ Aquarii, sometimes called Ancha, is a G8 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.16 and an absolute magnitude of 1.4.
λ Aquarii, also called Hudoor or Ekchusis, is an M2 spectral class star of magnitude 3.74 and luminosity of 120 L☉.
ξ Aquarii, also called  <START:person> Bunda <END> , is an A7 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.69 and an absolute magnitude of 2.4.
π Aquarii, also called Seat, is a B0 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.66 and an absolute magnitude of -4.1.
Planetary systems.
Twelve exoplanet systems have been found in Aquarius as of 2013.
Gliese 876, one of the nearest stars to Earth at a distance of 15 light-years, was the first red dwarf star to be found to possess a planetary system.
It is orbited by four planets, including one terrestrial planet 6.6 times the mass of Earth.
The planets vary in orbital period from 2 days to 124 days.
91 Aquarii is an orange giant star orbited by one planet, 91 Aquarii b.
The planet's mass is 2.9 times the mass of Jupiter, and its orbital period is 182 days.
Gliese 849 is a red dwarf star orbited by the first known long-period Jupiter-like planet, Gliese 849 b.
The planet's mass is 0.99 times that of Jupiter and its orbital period is 1,852 days.
There are also less-prominent systems in Aquarius.
WASP-6, a type G8 star of magnitude 12.4, is host to one exoplanet, WASP-6 b.
The star is 307 parsecs from Earth and has a mass of 0.888 solar masses and a radius of 0.87 solar radii.
WASP-6 b was discovered in 2008 by the transit method.
It orbits its parent star every 3.36 days at a distance of 0.042 astronomical units (AU).
It is 0.503 Jupiter masses but has a proportionally larger radius of 1.224 Jupiter radii.
HD 206610, a K0 star located 194 parsecs from Earth, is host to one planet, HD 206610 b.
The host star is larger than the Sun; more massive at 1.56 solar masses and larger at 6.1 solar radii.
The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method n 2010 and has a mass of 2.2 Jupiter masses.
It orbits every 610 days at a distance of 1.68 AU.
Much closer to its sun is WASP-47 b, which orbits every 4.15 days only 0.052 AU from its sun, yellow dwarf (G9V) WASP-47.
WASP-47 is close in size to the Sun, having a radius of 1.15 solar radii and a mass even closer at 1.08 solar masses.
WASP-47 b was discovered in 2011 by the transit method, like WASP-6 b.
It is slightly larger than Jupiter with a mass of 1.14 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.15 Jupiter masses.
There are several more single-planet systems in Aquarius.
HD 210277, a magnitude 6.63 yellow star located 21.29 parsecs from Earth, is host to one known planet: HD 210277 b.
The 1.23 Jupiter mass planet orbits at nearly the same distance as Earth orbits the Sun 1.1 AU, though its orbital period is significantly longer at around 442 days.
HD 210277 b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in Aquarius, detected by the radial velocity method in 1998.
The star it orbits resembles the Sun beyond their similar spectral class; it has a radius of 1.1 solar radii and a mass of 1.09 solar masses.
HD 212771 b, a larger planet at 2.3 Jupiter masses, orbits host star HD 212771 at a distance of 1.22 AU.
The star itself, barely below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.6, is a G8IV (yellow subgiant) star located 131 parsecs from Earth.
Though it has a similar mass to the Sun 1.15 solar masses it is significantly less dense with its radius of 5 solar radii.
Its lone planet was discovered in 2010 by the radial velocity method, like several other exoplanets in the constellation.
As of 2013, there are only two multiple-planet systems within the bounds of Aquarius: the Gliese 876 and HD 215152 systems.
The former is quite prominent; the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at 21.5 parsecs.
The HD 215152 system consists of the planets HD 215152 b and HD 215152 c orbiting their K0-type, magnitude 8.13 sun.
Both discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method, the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star.
HD 215152 c is the larger at 0.0097 Jupiter masses (still significantly larger than the Earth, which weighs in at 0.00315 Jupiter masses); its smaller sibling is barely smaller at 0.0087 Jupiter masses.
The error in the mass measurements (0.0032 and 0.0049 MJ respectively) is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant.
HD 215152 c also orbits further from the star than HD 215152 b, 0.0852 AU compared to 0.0652.
Deep sky objects.
Because of its position away from the galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae.
Aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the  <START:person> Messier <END>  catalog: the globular clusters Messier 2,  <START:person> Messier <END>  72, and the open cluster  <START:person> Messier <END>  73.
Two well-known planetary nebulae are also located in Aquarius: the Saturn Nebula (NGC 7009), to the eastwest of μ Aquarii; and the famous Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), southwest of δ Aquarii.
M2, also catalogued as NGC 7089, is an incredibly rich globular cluster located approximately 37,000 light-years from Earth.
At magnitude 6.5, it is viewable in small-aperture instruments, but a 100 mm aperture telescope is needed to resolve any stars.
M72, also catalogued as NGC 6981, is a small 9th magnitude globular cluster located approximately 56,000 light-years from Earth.
M73, also catalogued as NGC 6994, is an open cluster with highly disputed status.
Aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae.
NGC 7009, also known as the Saturn Nebula, is an 8th magnitude planetary nebula located 3,000 light-years from Earth.
It was given its moniker by the 19th century astronomer Lord  <START:person> Rosse <END>  for its resemblance to the planet Saturn in a telescope; it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble Saturn's rings.
It appears blue-green in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude 11.3.
Compared to the Helix Nebula, another planetary nebula in Aquarius, it is quite small.
NGC 7293, also known as the Helix Nebula, is the closest planetary nebula to Earth at a distance of 650 light-years.
It covers 0.25 square degrees, making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from Earth.
However, because it is so large, it is only viewable as a very faint object, though it has a fairly high integrated magnitude of 6.0.
One of the visible galaxies in Aquarius is NGC 7727, of particular interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe supernovae.
A spiral galaxy (type S), it has an integrated magnitude of 10.7 and is 3 by 3 arcseconds.
NGC 7252 is a tangle of stars resulting from the collision of two large galaxies and is known as the Atoms-for-Peace galaxy because of its resemblance to a cartoon atom.
Meteor showers.
There are three major meteor showers with radiants in Aquarius: the Eta Aquariids, the Delta Aquariids, and the Iota Aquariids.
The Eta Aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from Aquarius.
It peaks between 5 and 6 May with a rate of approximately 35 meteors per hour.
Originally discovered by Chinese astronomers in 401 CE, Eta Aquariids can be seen coming from the Water Jar beginning on April 21 and as late as May 12.
The parent body of the shower is  <START:person> Halley <END> 's Comet, a periodic comet.
Fireballs are common shortly after the peak, approximately between May 9 and May 11.
The normal meteors appear to have yellow trails.
The Delta Aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 July and second on 6 August.
The first radiant is located in the south of the constellation, while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of Pisces asterism.
The southern radiant's peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour, while the northern radiant's peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour.
The Iota Aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on 6 August, with a rate of approximately 8 meteors per hour.
Astrology.
s of 2002[ [update]], the Sun appears in the constellation Aquarius from 16 February to 11 March.
In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Aquarius from 20 January to 19 February, and in sidereal astrology, from 15 February to 14 March.
Aquarius is also associated with the Age of Aquarius, a concept popular in 1960s counterculture.
Despite this prominence, the Age of Aquarius will not dawn until the year 2597, as an astrological age does not begin until the Sun is in a particular constellation on the vernal equinox.

Coordinates:    <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell  Alexander Graham Bell <END>  (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was an eminent Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer and innovator who is credited with inventing the first practical telephone.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing  <START:person> Bell <END> 's life's work.
His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.
Many other inventions marked  <START:person> Bell <END> 's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils and aeronautics.
In 1888,  <START:person> Bell <END>  became one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society.
Early life.
 <START:person> Alexander Bell <END>  was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3, 1847.
The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END> 's birthplace.
He had two brothers:  <START:person> Melville James Bell <END>  (1845–70) and  <START:person> Edward Charles Bell <END>  (1848–67).
Both of his brothers died of tuberculosis.
His father was Professor  <START:person> Alexander Melville Bell <END> , and his mother was  <START:person> Eliza Grace <END>  (née Symonds).
Although he was born "Alexander", at age 10, he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers.
For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the middle name " <START:person> Graham <END> ", chosen out of admiration for  <START:person> Alexander Graham <END> , a Canadian being treated by his father and boarder who had become a family friend.
To close relatives and friends he remained "Aleck" which his father continued to call him into later life.
First invention.
As a child, young  <START:person> Bell <END>  displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age.
His best friend was  <START:person> Ben Herdman <END> , a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays.
 <START:person> Young Bell <END>  asked what needed to be done at the mill.
He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.
In return,  <START:person> John Herdman <END>  gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to "invent".
From his early years,  <START:person> Bell <END>  showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother.
With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist.
Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.
He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study acoustics.
His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END> , in London, his uncle in Dublin, and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists.
His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his "The Standard Elocutionist" (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868.
"The Standard Elocutionist" appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone.
In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities.
He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic, and even Sanskrit, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.
Education.
As a young child,  <START:person> Bell <END> , like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father.
At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms.
His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades.
His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father.
Upon leaving school,  <START:person> Bell <END>  travelled to London to live with his grandfather,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END> .
During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study.
The elder  <START:person> Bell <END>  took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself.
At age 16, Bell secured a position as a "pupil-teacher" of elocution and music, in Weston House Academy, at Elgin, Moray, Scotland.
Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session.
The following year, he attended the University of Edinburgh; joining his older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  who had enrolled there the previous year.
In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family,  <START:person> Bell <END>  completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the University of London.
First experiments with sound.
His father encouraged  <START:person> Bell <END> ’s interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique automaton, developed by Sir  <START:person> Charles Wheatstone <END>  based on the earlier work of  <START:person> Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen <END> .
The rudimentary "mechanical man" simulated a human voice.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of  <START:person> von Kempelen <END> 's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  built their own automaton head.
Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful.
While his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull.
His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could "speak", albeit only a few words.
The boys would carefully adjust the "lips" and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe, a very recognizable "Mama" ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.
Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye Terrier, "Trouve".
After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding "Ow ah oo ga ma ma".
With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate "How are you grandma?"
More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a "talking dog".
However, these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using tuning forks to explore resonance.
At the age of 19, he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist  <START:person> Alexander Ellis <END> , a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor  <START:person> Henry Higgins <END>  in "Pygmalion").
 <START:person> Ellis <END>  immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of  <START:person> Hermann von Helmholtz <END> 's work, "The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music".
Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by  <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork "contraption", he pored over the German scientist's book.
Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: "Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech."
He also later remarked: "I thought that  <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity.
It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!"
Family tragedy.
In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London,  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment.
Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.
Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion.
His younger brother,  <START:person> Edward "Ted <END> ," was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from tuberculosis.
While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as "A.G.
Bell") and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, Bath, England, his brother's condition deteriorated.
 <START:person> Edward <END>  would never recover.
Upon his brother's death,  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned home in 1867.
His older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  had married and moved out.
With aspirations to obtain a degree at the University College London,  <START:person> Bell <END>  considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.
Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to  <START:person> Susanna E. Hull <END> 's private school for the deaf in South Kensington, London.
His first two pupils were "deaf mute" girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage.
While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family,  <START:person> Bell <END>  continued as a teacher.
However, in May 1870,  <START:person> Melville <END>  died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis.
His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in Newfoundland.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly.
Acting decisively,  <START:person> Alexander Melville Bell <END>  asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property, conclude all of his brother's affairs ( <START:person> Bell <END>  took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp), and join his father and mother in setting out for the "New World".
Reluctantly,  <START:person> Bell <END>  also had to conclude a relationship with  <START:person> Marie Eccleston <END> , who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.
Canada.
In 1870, at age 23,  <START:person> Bell <END> , his brother's widow,  <START:person> Caroline <END>  ( <START:person> Margaret Ottaway <END> ), and his parents travelled on the SS "Nestorian" to Canada.
After landing at Quebec City the Bells transferred to another steamer to Montreal and then boarded a train to Paris, Ontario, to stay with the Reverend  <START:person> Thomas Henderson <END> , a family friend.
After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the  <START:person> Bell <END>  family purchased a farm of 10.5 acre at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near Brantford, Ontario.
The property consisted of an orchard, large farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house, and a carriage house, which bordered the Grand River.
At the homestead,  <START:person> Bell <END>  set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his "dreaming place", a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river.
Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly improved.
He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga, he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols.
For his work,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances.
After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on  <START:person> Helmholtz <END> 's work with electricity and sound.
He also modified a melodeon (a type of pump organ) so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance.
Once the family was settled in, both  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where  <START:person> Melville <END>  was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.
Work with the deaf.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father was invited by  <START:person> Sarah Fuller <END> , principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public  <START:person> Horace Mann <END>  School for the Deaf), in Boston, Massachusetts, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post in favor of his son.
Traveling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors.
He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the American Asylum for Deaf-mutes in Hartford, Connecticut, and the  <START:person> Clarke <END>  School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts.
Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his "harmonic telegraph".
The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.
Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher.
His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting  <START:person> Gardiner Greene Hubbard <END> , the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation.
Teaching his father's system, in October 1872,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END>  opened his "School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech" in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils, with his first class numbering 30 students.
While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was  <START:person> Helen Keller <END> , who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak.
She was later to say that  <START:person> Bell <END>  dedicated his life to the penetration of that "inhuman silence which separates and estranges."
In 1893,  <START:person> Keller <END>  performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of the new Bell's new Volta Bureau, dedicated to "the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf".
Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded.
In several schools, children were mistreated, for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing—the only language they knew—in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication.
Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing deaf culture.
Continuing experimentation.
In the following year,  <START:person> Bell <END>  became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory.
During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home.
At Boston University,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was "swept up" by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city.
He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation.
While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house.
Keeping "night owl" hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment.
Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover.
Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches.
Returning to Boston in fall 1873,  <START:person> Bell <END>  made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.
Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell retained only two students, six-year-old " <START:person> Georgie" Sanders <END> , deaf from birth, and 15-year-old  <START:person> Mabel Hubbard <END> .
Each pupil would play an important role in the next developments.
 <START:person> George <END> 's father,  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END> , a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby Salem with  <START:person> Georgie <END> 's grandmother, complete with a room to "experiment".
Although the offer was made by  <START:person> George <END> 's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr.  <START:person> Sanders <END>  was backing the proposal.
The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in.
 <START:person> Mabel <END>  was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years  <START:person> Bell <END> 's junior, but became the object of his affection.
Having lost her hearing after a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday, she had learned to read lips but her father,  <START:person> Gardiner Greene Hubbard <END> , Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.
Telephone.
By 1874,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston "laboratory" (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success.
While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a "phonautograph", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations.
Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound.
But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.
In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of Western Union President  <START:person> William Orton <END> , had become "the nervous system of commerce".
 <START:person> Orton <END>  had contracted with inventors  <START:person> Thomas Edison <END>  and  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines.
When  <START:person> Bell <END>  mentioned to  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END>  that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments.
Patent matters would be handled by  <START:person> Hubbard <END> 's patent attorney,  <START:person> Anthony Pollok <END> .
In March 1875, Bell and  <START:person> Pollok <END>  visited the famous scientist  <START:person> Joseph Henry <END> , who was then director of the Smithsonian Institution, and asked  <START:person> Henry <END> 's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph.
 <START:person> Henry <END>  replied that Bell had "the germ of a great invention".
When  <START:person> Bell <END>  said that he did not have the necessary knowledge,  <START:person> Henry <END>  replied, "Get it!"
That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas.
However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and  <START:person> Thomas A. Watson <END> , an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of  <START:person> Charles Williams <END> , changed all that.
With financial support from  <START:person> Sanders <END>  and  <START:person> Hubbard <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  hired  <START:person> Thomas Watson <END>  as his assistant, and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy.
On June 2, 1875,  <START:person> Watson <END>  accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech.
That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds.
This led to the "gallows" sound-powered telephone, which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.
The race to the patent office.
In 1875, Bell developed an acoustic telegraph and drew up a patent application for it.
Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  requested that an associate in Ontario,  <START:person> George Brown <END> , attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).
Meanwhile,  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter.
On February 14, 1876,  <START:person> Gray <END>  filed a caveat with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter.
That same morning,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's lawyer filed  <START:person> Bell <END> 's application with the patent office.
There is considerable debate about who arrived first and  <START:person> Gray <END>  later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the U.S. Patent Office.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent covered "the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound"  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.
On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued,  <START:person> Bell <END>  succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design.
Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the electrical resistance in the circuit.
When Bell spoke the famous sentence "Mr.
 <START:person> Watson <END> —Come here—I want to see you" into the liquid transmitter,  <START:person> Watson <END> , listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.
Although  <START:person> Bell <END>  was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray, Bell used  <START:person> Gray <END> 's water transmitter design only after  <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent had been granted, and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment, to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.
After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used  <START:person> Gray <END> 's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.
The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved  <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent application.
He told  <START:person> Bell <END>  that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which  <START:person> Bell <END>  described a cup of mercury, not water.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  described the water device.
In addition,  <START:person> Gray <END>  abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest  <START:person> Bell <END> 's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876.
Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but  <START:person> Bell <END>  was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.
The patent examiner,  <START:person> Zenas Fisk Wilber <END> , later stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer,  <START:person> Marcellus Bailey <END> , with whom he had served in the Civil War.
He claimed he showed  <START:person> Gray <END> 's patent caveat to  <START:person> Bailey <END> .
 <START:person> Wilber <END>  also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed  <START:person> Gray <END> 's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100.
Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray,  <START:person> Bell <END>  admitted that he learned some of the technical details.
Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave  <START:person> Wilber <END>  any money.
Later developments.
Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone.
On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles (eight km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready.
With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying.
The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel.
This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing.
These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  and his partners,  <START:person> Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Sanders <END> , offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000.
The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy.
Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25 million he would consider it a bargain.
By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent.
Bell's investors would become millionaires, while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.
Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public.
A short time later, his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia brought the telephone to international attention.
Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor  <START:person> Pedro II <END>  of Brazil.
Later Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to Sir  <START:person> William Thomson <END>  (later, Lord  <START:person> Kelvin <END> ), a renowned Scottish scientist, as well as to  <START:person> Queen Victoria <END> , who had requested a private audience at Osborne House, her Isle of  <START:person> Wight <END>  home.
She called the demonstration "most extraordinary".
The enthusiasm surrounding  <START:person> Bell <END> 's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.
The Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones.
Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever.
In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union.
This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.
In January 1915,  <START:person> Bell <END>  made the first ceremonial transcontinental telephone call.
Calling from the AT&T head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was heard by  <START:person> Thomas Watson <END>  at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco.
The "New York Times" reported: On October 9, 1876,  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas A. Watson <END>  talked by telephone to each other over a two-mile wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston.
It was the first wire conversation ever held.
Yesterday afternoon [on January 25, 1915] the same two men talked by telephone to each other over a 3,400-mile wire between New York and San Francisco.
Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END> , the veteran inventor of the telephone, was in New York, and Mr.  <START:person> Watson <END> , his former associate, was on the other side of the continent.
They heard each other much more distinctly than they did in their first talk thirty-eight years ago.
Competitors.
As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone.
Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments.
The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  and  <START:person> Amos Dolbear <END> .
In personal correspondence to Bell, both  <START:person> Gray <END>  and  <START:person> Dolbear <END>  had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.
On January 13, 1887, the U,S.
Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation.
After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided.
By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents (No. 174,465 dated March 7, 1876 and No. 186,787 dated January 30, 1877) were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case's importance as a "precedent".
With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the US Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on November 30, 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits.
During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Italian inventor  <START:person> Antonio Meucci <END>  also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834.
In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved,  <START:person> Meucci <END>  took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority.
 <START:person> Meucci <END> 's evidence in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York, which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in 1901.
 <START:person> Meucci <END> 's work, like many other inventors of the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving  <START:person> Meucci <END>  was eventually dropped upon  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's death.
However, due to the efforts of Congressman  <START:person> Vito Fossella <END> , the U.S. House of Representatives on June 11, 2002 stated that  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's "work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged", even though this did not put an end to a still contentious issue.
Some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that Bell's work on the telephone was influenced by  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's inventions.
The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world, and patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell had delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of Siemens & Halske (S&H) managed to set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent.
The Siemens company produced near-identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties.
The establishment of the International Bell Telephone Company in Brussels, Belgium in 1880, as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation.
The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court, necessitated by the legal battles, eventually resulted in his resignation from the company.
Family life.
On July 11, 1877, a few days after the Bell Telephone Company was established, Bell married  <START:person> Mabel Hubbard <END>  (1857–1923) at the  <START:person> Hubbard <END>  estate in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
His wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1,487 of his 1,497 shares in the newly formed Bell Telephone Company.
Shortly thereafter, the newlyweds embarked on a year-long honeymoon in Europe.
During that excursion,  <START:person> Bell <END>  took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a "working holiday".
The courtship had begun years earlier; however,  <START:person> Bell <END>  waited until he was more financially secure before marrying.
Although the telephone appeared to be an "instant" success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897.
One unusual request exacted by his fiancée was that he use "Alec" rather than the family's earlier familiar name of "Aleck".
From 1876, he would sign his name " <START:person> Alec Bell <END> ".
They had four children:  <START:person> Elsie May Bell <END>  (1878–1964) who married  <START:person> Gilbert Grosvenor <END>  of National Geographic fame,  <START:person> Marian Hubbard Bell <END>  (1880–1962) who was referred to as "Daisy", and two sons who died in infancy ( <START:person> Edward <END>  in 1881 and  <START:person> Robert <END>  in 1883).
The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when  <START:person> Bell <END> 's father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C., and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for  <START:person> Bell <END> 's family, so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was a British subject throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882, when he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
In 1915, he characterized his status as: "I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries."
Despite this declaration,  <START:person> Bell <END>  has been proudly claimed as a "native son" by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated.
That summer, the Bells had a vacation on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck.
Returning in 1886,  <START:person> Bell <END>  started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake.
By 1889, a large house, christened "The Lodge" was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Bells would name  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END>  (Gaelic: "beautiful mountain") after  <START:person> Bell <END> 's ancestral Scottish highlands.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  also built the Bell Boatyard on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the Royal Canadian Navy and pleasure craft for the Bell family.
An enthusiastic boater,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his family sailed a rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the  <START:person> H.W. Embree <END>  and Sons boatyard in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia.
In his final, and some of his most productive years,  <START:person> Bell <END>  split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn Bhreagh where they spent increasing amounts of time.
Until the end of his life,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his family would alternate between the two homes, but "Beinn Bhreagh" would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as  <START:person> Bell <END>  became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened.
Both  <START:person> Mabel <END>  and  <START:person> Bell <END>  became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as "their own".
The Bells were still in residence at "Beinn Bhreagh" when the Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6, 1917.
 <START:person> Mabel <END>  and  <START:person> Bell <END>  mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax.
Later inventions.
Although  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied.
According to one of his biographers,  <START:person> Charlotte Gray <END> , Bell's work ranged "unfettered across the scientific landscape" and he often went to bed voraciously reading the "Encyclopædia Britannica", scouring it for new areas of interest.
The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators.
These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the photophone, one for the phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for "hydroairplanes" and two for selenium cells.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding alternative fuels.
Bell worked extensively in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf.
During his Volta Laboratory period,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound.
Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype.
They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the hard disc and floppy disc drive and other magnetic media.
Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice.
He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution.
Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories.
At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere.
In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses.
Photophone.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  and his assistant  <START:person> Charles Sumner Tainter <END>  jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a photophone, which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of light.
Both men later became full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association.
On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the Franklin School in Washington, D.C., to  <START:person> Bell <END>  at the window of his laboratory, some 213 m away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  believed the photophone's principles were his life's "greatest achievement", telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was "the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone".
The photophone was a precursor to the fiber-optic communication systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s.
Its master patent was issued in December 1880, many decades before the photophone's principles came into popular use.
Metal detector.
Bell is also credited with the invention of the metal detector in 1881.
The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President  <START:person> James Garfield <END> .
According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static.
The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored  <START:person> Bell <END> 's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs.
Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's own detailed account, presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet.
Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of  <START:person> Garfield <END> , Bell "...proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning...to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed.
It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires.
Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes.
The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect."
In a footnote,  <START:person> Bell <END>  adds that "The death of President  <START:person> Garfield <END>  and the subsequent "post-mortem" examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus."
Hydrofoils.
The March 1906 "Scientific American" article by American pioneer  <START:person> William E. Meacham <END>  explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and hydroplanes.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement.
Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat.
Bell and assistant  <START:person> Frederick W. <END>  "Casey"  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water.
 <START:person> Baldwin <END>  studied the work of the Italian inventor  <START:person> Enrico Forlanini <END>  and began testing models.
This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.
During his world tour of 1910–11,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  met with Forlanini in France.
They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore.
 <START:person> Baldwin <END>  described it as being as smooth as flying.
On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the "Dhonnas Beag", the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.
The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD-4, powered by Renault engines.
A top speed of 54 mph was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.
In 1913, Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END>  hired  <START:person> Walter Pinaud <END> , a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of  <START:person> Pinaud <END> 's Yacht Yard in Westmount, Nova Scotia to work on the pontoons of the HD-4.
 <START:person> Pinaud <END>  soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia.
 <START:person> Pinaud <END> 's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4.
After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4.
Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 hp engines in July 1919.
On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 mph, a record which stood for ten years.
Aeronautics.
In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft.
The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek "young" help as  <START:person> Bell <END>  was at the age of 60.
In 1898, Bell experimented with tetrahedral box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk.
The tetrahedral wings were named "Cygnet" I, II and  <START:person> III <END> , and were flown both unmanned and manned ("Cygnet I" crashed during a flight carrying  <START:person> Selfridge <END> ) in the period from 1907–1912.
Some of Bell's kites are on display at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife  <START:person> Mabel <END>  and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate.
The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men: American  <START:person> Glenn H. Curtiss <END> , a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title "world's fastest man", having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the Scientific American Trophy for the first official one-kilometre flight in the Western hemisphere, and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant  <START:person> Thomas Selfridge <END> , an official observer from the U.S. Federal government and one of the few people in the army who believed that aviation was the future;  <START:person> Frederick W. Baldwin <END> , the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in Hammondsport, New York, and  <START:person> J.A.D. McCurdy <END>  — <START:person> Baldwin <END>  and  <START:person> McCurdy <END>  being new engineering graduates from the University of Toronto.
The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders.
Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the "Red Wing", framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine.
On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.
The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control).
One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the aileron, was to become a standard component on all aircraft.
The "White Wing" and "June Bug" were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished.
However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $15,000 grant from Mrs.  <START:person> Bell <END>  allowed it to continue with experiments.
Lt.  <START:person> Selfridge <END>  had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the Wright Flyer at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908.
Their final aircraft design, the "Silver Dart", embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines.
On February 23, 1909,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was present as the "Silver Dart" flown by  <START:person> J.A.D. McCurdy <END>  from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or, made the first aircraft flight in Canada.
Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand.
With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the "Silver Dart" would revert to  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  and  <START:person> McCurdy <END>  who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the Canadian Army.
Eugenics.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was connected with the eugenics movement in the United States.
In his lecture "Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race" presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry.
However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist  <START:person> David Starr Jordan <END> 's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the American Breeders Association.
The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man.
From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugenics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and regularly attended meetings.
In 1921, he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be, as  <START:person> Bell <END>  called them, a "defective variety of the human race".
By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany.
Legacy and honors.
Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his most famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew.
Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities, to the point that the requests almost became burdensome.
During his life he also received dozens of major awards, medals and other tributes.
These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created, notably the Bell Telephone Memorial erected in his honor in " <START:person> Alexander Graham <END>  Bell Gardens" in Brantford, Ontario, in 1917.
A large number of Bell's writings, personal correspondence, notebooks, papers and other documents reside at both the United States Library of Congress Manuscript Division (as the " <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  Family Papers"), and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute, Cape Breton University, Nova Scotia; major portions of which are available for online viewing.
A number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North America and Europe, including the first telephone companies of the United States and Canada.
Among the major sites are: In 1880, Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$ in today's dollars) for the invention of the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government.
Among the luminaries who judged were  <START:person> Victor Hugo <END>  and  <START:person> Alexandre Dumas <END> .
The Volta Prize was conceived by  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END>  in 1801, and named in honor of  <START:person> Alessandro Volta <END> , with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history.
Since  <START:person> Bell <END>  was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C..
These included the prestigious" 'Volta Laboratory Association' "(1880), also known as the" Volta Laboratory "and as the" ' <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  Laboratory', "and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.
The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that  <START:person> Edison <END>  himself later adopted.
The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his "proudest achievement", "the photophone", the "optical telephone" which presaged fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.
In partnership with  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s.
In 1888,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society and became its second president (1897–1904), and also became a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution (1898–1922).
The French government conferred on him the decoration of the Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor); the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 1902; the University of Würzburg, Bavaria, granted him a PhD, and he was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912.
He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884, and served as its president from 1891–92.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was later awarded the AIEE's Edison Medal in 1914 "For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone".
The "bel" (B) and the smaller "decibel" (dB) are units of measurement of sound intensity invented by Bell Labs and named after him.
Since 1976 the IEEE's  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell Medal <END>  has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications.
In 1936 the US Patent Office declared Bell first on its list of the country's greatest inventors, leading to the US Post Office issuing a commemorative stamp honoring Bell in 1940 as part of its 'Famous Americans Series'.
The First Day of Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston, Massachusetts, the city where  <START:person> Bell <END>  spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf.
The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time.
The stamp became, and remains to this day, the most valuable one of the series.
The 150th anniversary of Bell's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative £1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell's face in profile, his signature, and objects from Bell's life and career: users of the telephone over the ages; an audio wave signal; a diagram of a telephone receiver; geometric shapes from engineering structures; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet; the geese which helped him to understand flight; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics.
Additionally, the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C$100 gold coin, in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth, and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada.
That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END> 's tutelage, named the  <START:person> Silver Dart <END> .
Bell's image, and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money, coinage and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years.
 <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  was ranked 57th among the 100 Greatest Britons (2002) in an official BBC nationwide poll, and among the Top Ten Greatest Canadians (2004), and the 100 Greatest Americans (2005).
In 2006 Bell was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history after having been listed in the National Library of Scotland's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame'.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's name is still widely known and used as part of the names of dozens of educational institutes, corporate namesakes, street and place names around the world.
Honorary degrees.
 <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END> , who could not complete the university program of his youth, received at least a dozen honorary degrees from academic institutions, including eight honorary LL.D.s (Doctorate of Laws), two Ph.D.s, a D.Sc. and an M.D.: Death.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  died of complications arising from diabetes on August 2, 1922, at his private estate,  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END> , Nova Scotia, at age 75.
Bell had also been afflicted with pernicious anemia.
His last view of the land he had inhabited was by moonlight on his mountain estate at 2:00 A.M.
While tending to him after his long illness,  <START:person> Mabel <END> , his wife, whispered, "Don't leave me."
By way of reply,  <START:person> Bell <END>  traced the sign for "no" in the air —and then he died.
On learning of Bell's death, the Canadian Prime Minister,  <START:person> Mackenzie King <END> , cabled Mrs.  <START:person> Bell <END> , saying: "My colleagues in the Government join with me in expressing to you our sense of the world's loss in the death of your distinguished husband.
It will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention, with which his name is immortally associated, is a part of its history.
On the behalf of the citizens of Canada, may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's coffin was constructed of  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END>  pine by his laboratory staff, lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite experiments.
To help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests not to wear black (the traditional funeral color) while attending his service, during which soloist  <START:person> Jean MacDonald <END>  sang a verse of  <START:person> Robert Louis Stevenson <END> 's "Requiem": Upon the conclusion of Bell's funeral, "every phone on the continent of North America was silenced in honor of the man who had given to mankind the means for direct communication at a distance".
Dr.  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  was buried atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain, on his estate where he had resided increasingly for the last 35 years of his life, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake.
He was survived by his wife  <START:person> Mabel <END> , his two daughters,  <START:person> Elsie May <END>  and  <START:person> Marian <END> , and nine of his grandchildren.

Patents.
"U.S. patent images in TIFF format"  Aaron  In the Hebrew Bible and the Quran,  <START:person> Aaron אַהֲרֹן <END>  () was the older brother of Moses (Exodus 6:16-20, 7:7; Qur'an 28:34), a prophet of God.
Unlike  <START:person> Moses <END> , who grew up in the Egyptian royal court,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his younger sister  <START:person> Miriam <END>  remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen).
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  served as his brother's spokesman ("prophet") to Pharaoh.
() Part of the Law (Torah) that  <START:person> Moses <END>  received from God at Sinai granted  <START:person> Aaron <END>  the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites.
Various dates for his life have been proposed, ranging from approximately 1600 to 1200 BC.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  died before the Israelites crossed the Jordan river and he was buried on Mount Hor (Numbers 33:39; Deuteronomy 10:6 says he died and was buried at Moserah.)  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible.
Account in the Hebrew Bible.
Traditional genealogy.
Descended from " <START:person> Abraham <END> ", " <START:person> Isaac <END> ", and "Jacob" Great-grandfather: "Levi" Grandfather: "Kohath" Father: "Amram" Mother: "Jochebed" Older Sister: " <START:person> Miriam <END> " Younger Brother: "Moses" Uncles: "Izhar", "Hebron", "Uzziel" Wife: "Elisheba" Sons: "Nadab, Abihu", "Eleazar", "Ithamar" Grandson: "Phinehas" According to the Book of Exodus,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  first functioned as  <START:person> Moses <END> ' assistant.
Because  <START:person> Moses <END>  complained that he could not speak well, God appointed  <START:person> Aaron <END>  as  <START:person> Moses <END> ' "prophet" (Exodus 4:10-17; 7:1).
At the command of  <START:person> Moses <END> , he let his rod turn into a snake (Exodus 7:9-12).
Then he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues (Exodus 7:19, 8:1,12).
After that,  <START:person> Moses <END>  tended to act and speak for himself (Exodus 9:23, 10:13,22).
During the journey in the wilderness,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was not always prominent or active.
At the battle with  <START:person> Amalek <END> , he was chosen with  <START:person> Hur <END>  to support the hand of Moses that held the "rod of God" (Exodus 17:9).
When the revelation was given to  <START:person> Moses <END>  at Mount Sinai, he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied  <START:person> Moses <END>  on the way to the summit.
While  <START:person> Joshua <END>  went with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to the top, however,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and  <START:person> Hur <END>  remained below to look after the people (Exodus 24:9-14).
From here on in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers,  <START:person> Joshua <END>  appears in the role of  <START:person> Moses <END> ' assistant while  <START:person> Aaron <END>  functions instead as the first high priest.
High Priest.
The books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers maintain that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  received from God a monopoly over the priesthood for himself and his male descendants (Exodus 28:1).
The family of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to the God of Israel.
The rest of his tribe, the Levites, were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary (Numbers 3).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  anointed and consecrated  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his sons to the priesthood, and arrayed them in the robes of office (Leviticus 8; cf.
Exodus 28-29).
He also related to them God's detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the Israelites listened (Leviticus 1-7, 11-27).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his successors as high priest were given control over the Urim and Thummim by which the will of God could be determined (Exodus 28:30).
God commissioned the Aaronide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean, and to teach the divine laws (the Torah) to the Israelites (Leviticus 10:10-11).
The priests were also commissioned to bless the people (Numbers 6:22-27).
When  <START:person> Aaron <END>  completed the altar offerings for the first time and, with  <START:person> Moses <END> , "blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people: And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces" (Leviticus 9:23-24).
In this way, the institution of the Aaronide priesthood was established.
In later books of the Old Testament,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later.
The books of Judges,  <START:person> Samuel <END>  and Kings mention priests and  <START:person> Levites <END> , but do not mention the Aaronides in particular.
The book of Ezekial, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King  <START:person> David <END> 's priests.
It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position.
A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and  <START:person> Levites <END>  appears in Ezra,  <START:person> Nehemiah <END>  and Chronicles.
As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel.
What is clear is that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period.
Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form early in this period, which may account for  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.
Leadership conflicts.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  plays a leading role in several stories of conflicts over leadership during Israel's wilderness wanderings.
During the prolonged absence of Moses on Mount Sinai, the people provoked  <START:person> Aaron <END>  to make a Golden Calf as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from Egypt (Exodus 32:1-6).
This incident nearly caused God to destroy the Israelites for their unfaithfulness to the covenant (Exodus 32:10).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  successfully intervened, but then led the loyal  <START:person> Levites <END>  in executing many of the culprits and a plague afflicted those who were left (Exodus 32:25-35).
 <START:person> Aaron <END> , however, escaped punishment for his role in the affair, because of the intercession of Moses according to Deuteronomy 9:20.
Later retellings of this story almost always excuse  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for his role.
For example, in rabbinic sources and in the Qur'an,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was not the idol-maker and upon  <START:person> Moses <END> ' return begged his pardon because he felt mortally threatened by the Israelites (Quran 7:142-152).
On the day of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's consecration, his oldest sons,  <START:person> Nadab <END>  and  <START:person> Abihu <END> , were burned up by divine fire because they offered "strange" incense (Leviticus 10:1-3).
Most interpreters think this story reflects a conflict between priestly families sometime in Israel's past.
Others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow God's instructions given through Moses.
The Pentateuch generally depicts the siblings, Moses,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , and  <START:person> Miriam <END> , as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus, a view also reflected in the biblical book of  <START:person> Micah <END> .
Numbers 12, however, reports that on one occasion,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and  <START:person> Miriam <END>  complained about  <START:person> Moses <END> ' exclusive claim to be the LORD's prophet.
Their presumption was rebuffed by God who affirmed  <START:person> Moses <END> ' uniqueness as the one with whom the LORD spoke face to face.
 <START:person> Miriam <END>  was punished with skin disease ("leprous"), that turned her skin white.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  pleaded with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to intercede for her, and  <START:person> Miriam <END> , after seven days' quarantine, was healed.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  once again escaped any retribution.
According to Numbers 16-17, a  <START:person> Levite <END>  named  <START:person> Korah <END>  led many in challenging  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's exclusive claim to the priesthood.
When the rebels were punished by being swallowed up by the earth, (Numbers 16:25-35),  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , the son of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests.
And when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).
To emphasize the validity of the  <START:person> Levites <END> ' claim to the offerings and tithes of the Israelites,  <START:person> Moses <END>  collected a rod from the leaders of each tribe in Israel and laid the twelve rods over night in the tent of meeting.
The next morning,  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds (Numbers 17:23).
The following chapter then details the distinction between  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's family and the rest of the Levites: while all the Levites (and only  <START:person> Levites <END> ) were devoted to the care of the sanctuary, charge of its interior and the altar was committed to the Aaronites alone (Numbers 18:1-7).
Death.
 <START:person> Aaron <END> , like  <START:person> Moses <END> , was not permitted to enter Canaan with the Israelites because the two brothers showed impatience at Meribah (Kadesh) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage (Numbers 20:12-13), when  <START:person> Moses <END>  brought water out of a rock to quench the people's thirst.
Though they had been commanded to speak to the rock,  <START:person> Moses <END>  struck it with the staff twice, which was construed as displaying a lack of deference to the LORD (Numbers 20:7-11).
There are two accounts of the death of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the Pentateuch.
Numbers says that soon after the incident at Meribah,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  with his son  <START:person> Eleazar <END>  and  <START:person> Moses <END>  ascended  <START:person> Mount Hor <END> .
There Moses stripped  <START:person> Aaron <END>  of his priestly garments and transferred them to  <START:person> Eleazar <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days (Numbers 20:22-29; compare 33:38-39).
The other account is found in Deuteronomy 10:6, where  <START:person> Aaron <END>  died at Moserah and was buried.
There is a significant amount of travel between these two points, as the itinerary in Numbers 33:31–37 records seven stages between Moseroth (Mosera) and  <START:person> Mount Hor <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  was 123 at the time of his death.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in religious traditions.
Jewish Rabbinic literature.
The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of God and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities.
Thus  <START:person> Aaron <END> , the first priest, ranks below Moses: he is his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of God revealed through Moses, although it is pointed out that it is said fifteen times in the Pentateuch that "the Lord spoke to Moses "and"  <START:person> Aaron <END> ."
Under the influence of the priesthood that shaped the destinies of the nation under Persian rule, a different ideal of the priest was formed, according to  <START:person> Malachi <END>  2:4–7, and the prevailing tendency was to place  <START:person> Aaron <END>  on a footing equal with  <START:person> Moses <END> .
"At times  <START:person> Aaron <END> , and at other times Moses, is mentioned first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank," says  <START:person> Mekilta <END> , who strongly implies this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's ministration.
In fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head ( <START:person> Leviticus Rabbah <END>  x., Midrash Teh.
cxxxiii.
1),  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death, as described in the Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquility.
Accompanied by  <START:person> Moses <END> , his brother, and by  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , his son,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view.
"Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son  <START:person> Eleazar <END> !" said  <START:person> Moses <END> ; "and then follow me."
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood.
"Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother,"  <START:person> Moses <END>  continued; and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  obeyed without a murmur.
Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God.
The cave closed behind  <START:person> Moses <END>  as he left; and he went down the hill with  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , with garments rent, and crying: "Alas,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , my brother!
thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!"
When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, "Where is  <START:person> Aaron <END> ?" angels were seen carrying  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's bier through the air.
A voice was then heard saying: "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" ( <START:person> Malachi <END>  2:6).
He died, according to Seder Olam Rabbah ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab."
The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and  <START:person> R. H. 2b-3a <END> ).
The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq.
and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner:  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of  <START:person> Arad <END> , in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for  <START:person> Aaron <END> ; wherefore it is said: "There [at Mosera] died  <START:person> Aaron <END> ."
The rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and Moses.
When the latter was appointed ruler and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one another's greatness.
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  at first declined to go to Pharaoh, saying: "O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send" (Exodus 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive  <START:person> Aaron <END> , his brother, of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but the Lord reassured him, saying: "Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart" ().
Indeed,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was to find his reward, says  <START:person> Shimon <END>  bar  <START:person> Yochai <END> ; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother's rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the Urim and Thummim, which were to "be upon  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's heart when he goeth in before the Lord" ( <START:person> Canticles Rabbah <END>  i. 10).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  met in gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers (Exodus 4:27; compare Song of Songs 8:1), and of them it is written: "Behold how good and how pleasant [it is] for brethren to dwell together in unity!" (Psalms 133:1).
Of them it is said: "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other]" (Psalms 85:10); for  <START:person> Moses <END>  stood for righteousness, according to Deuteronomy 33:21, and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for peace, according to .
Again, mercy was personified in  <START:person> Aaron <END> , according to Deuteronomy 33:8, and truth in Moses, according to Numbers 12:7 .
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  poured the oil of anointment upon the head of  <START:person> Aaron <END> ,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  modestly shrank back and said: "Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office."
Then the Shekhinah spoke the words: "Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of Hermon" () .
According to  <START:person> Tanhuma <END> ,  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's activity as a prophet began earlier than that of Moses.
 <START:person> Hillel <END>  held  <START:person> Aaron <END>  up as an example, saying: "Be of the disciples of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , loving peace and pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law!"
This is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in Abot de-Rabbi Natan 12, Sanhedrin 6b, and elsewhere, according to which  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was an ideal priest of the people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was Moses.
While  <START:person> Moses <END>  was stern and uncompromising, brooking no wrong,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  went about as peacemaker, reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse.
The mourning of the people at  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death was greater, therefore, than at that of Moses; for whereas, when  <START:person> Aaron <END>  died the whole house of Israel wept, including the women, (Numbers 20:29)  <START:person> Moses <END>  was bewailed by "the sons of Israel" only (Deuteronomy 34:8).
Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
His fortitude and silent submission to the will of God on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify God in the midst of great affliction.
Especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by God after the princes of the Twelve Tribes had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: "Say to thy brother  <START:person> Aaron <END> : Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light shall last forever."
Christianity.
In the Eastern Orthodox and Maronite churches,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is venerated as a saint whose feast day is shared with his brother  <START:person> Moses <END>  and celebrated on September 4. (Those churches that follow the traditional Julian Calendar celebrate this day on September 17 of the modern Gregorian Calendar).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is also commemorated with other Old Testament saints on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers, the Sunday before Christmas.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 30.
He is commemorated on July 1 in the modern Latin calendar and in the Syriac Calendar.
In The Church of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  of Latter-day Saints, the Aaronic order is the lesser order of priesthood, comprising the grades (from lowest to highest) of deacon, teacher, and priest.
The chief office of the Aaronic priesthood is the presiding bishopric; the head of the priesthood is the bishop.
Each ward includes a quorum of one or more of each office of the Aaronic priesthood.
In the Community of Christ, the Aaronic order of priesthood is regarded as an appendage to the Melchisedec order, and consists of the priesthood offices of deacon, teacher, and priest.
While differing in responsibilities, these offices, along with those of the Melchisidec order, are regarded as equal before God.
Islam.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Arabic: هارون, "Hārūn") is also mentioned in the Quran as a prophet of God.
The Quran praises  <START:person> Aaron <END>  repeatedly, calling him a "believing servant" as well as one who was "guided" and one of the "victors".
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is important in Islam for his role in the events of the Exodus, in which, according to the Quran and Muslim tradition, he preached with his brother  <START:person> Moses <END>  to the Pharaoh of the Exodus.
 <START:person> Aaron <END> 's significance in Islam, however, is not limited to his role as the helper of Moses.
Islamic tradition also accords  <START:person> Aaron <END>  the role of a patriarch, as tradition records that the priestly descent came through  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's lineage, which included the entire House of Amran.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the Quran.
The Qur'an contains numerous references to  <START:person> Aaron <END> , both by name and without name.
It says that he was a descendant of  <START:person> Abraham <END>  (Qur'an 4: 163) and makes it clear that both he and  <START:person> Moses <END>  were sent together to warn the Pharaoh about God's punishment (Qur'an 10: 75).
It further adds that  <START:person> Moses <END>  had earlier prayed to God to strengthen his own ministry with  <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Qur'an 20: 29-30) and that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  helped  <START:person> Moses <END>  as he too was a prophet (Qur'an 19: 53) and was very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse (Qur'an 28: 34).
The Qur'an adds that both Moses and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the Israelites in Egypt, and to convert those houses into places of worship for God (Qur'an 10: 87).
The incident of the Golden Calf as it is narrated in the Qur'an paints  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in a positive light.
The Qur'an says that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was entrusted the leadership of Israel while  <START:person> Moses <END>  was up on Mount Sinai for a period of forty days (Qur'an 7: 142).
It adds that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf, which was built not by  <START:person> Aaron <END>  but by a wicked man by the name of  <START:person> Samiri <END>  (Qur'an 19: 50).
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  returned from Mount Sinai, he rebuked  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for allowing the worship of the idol, to which  <START:person> Aaron <END>  pleaded with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to not blame him when he had no role in its construction (Qur'an 7: 150).
The Qur'an then adds that  <START:person> Moses <END>  here lamented the sins of Israel and said he only had the power to protect himself and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Qur'an 5: 25).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is later commemorated in the Qur'an as one who had a "clear authority" (Qur'an 23: 45) and one who was "guided to the Right Path" (Qur'an 37: 118).
It further adds that  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's memory was left for people who came after him (Qur'an 37: 119) and he is blessed by God along with his brother (Qur'an 37: 120).
The Qur'an also calls the  <START:person> Virgin Mary <END>  a "sister of Aaron" (Qur'an 19: 28).
Muslim scholars debated as to who exactly this "Aaron" was in terms of his historical persona, with some saying that it was a reference to  <START:person> Aaron <END>  of the Exodus, and the term "sister" designating only a metaphorical or spiritual link between the two figures, all the more evident when  <START:person> Mary <END>  was a descendant of the priestly lineage of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , while others held it to be another righteous man living at the time of  <START:person> Christ <END>  by the name of "Aaron".
Most scholars have agreed to the former perspective, and have linked  <START:person> Mary <END>  spiritually with the actual sister of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , her namesake  <START:person> Miriam <END> , whom she resembled in many ways.
The Qur'an also narrates that, centuries later, when the Ark of the Covenant returned to Israel, it contained "relics from the family of  <START:person> Moses <END>  and relics from the family of  <START:person> Aaron <END> " (Qur'an 2: 248).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's time.
 <START:person> Muhammad <END> , in many of his sayings, speaks of  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
In the event of the Mi'raj, his miraculous ascension through the Heavens,  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  is said to have encountered  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the fifth heaven.
According to old scholars, including  <START:person> Ibn Hisham <END> ,  <START:person> Muhammad <END> , in particular, mentioned the beauty of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  when he encountered him in Heaven.
 <START:person> Martin Lings <END> , in his biographical " <START:person> Muhammad <END> ", speaks of  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's wonderment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory: Of  <START:person> Joseph <END>  he said that his face had the splendour of the moon at its full, and that he had been endowed with no less than the half of all existing beauty.
Yet this did not diminish  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's wonderment at his other brethren, and he mentioned in particular the great beauty of  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  was also mentioned by  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  in likeness to  <START:person> Ali <END> .
 <START:person> Muhammad <END>  had left  <START:person> Ali <END>  to look after his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found  <START:person> Ali <END>  a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence.
 <START:person> Ali <END> , grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  what the local people were saying.
In reply, the  <START:person> Prophet <END>  said: "They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me.
So return and represent me in my family and in thine.
Art thou not content,  <START:person> O Ali <END> , that thou should be unto me as  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was unto  <START:person> Moses <END> , save that after me there is no prophet.
" Burial Place.
According to Islamic tradition the tomb of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is located on "Jabal Harun", or  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's Mountain, near Petra in Jordan.
At 1350 meters above sea-level it is the highest peak in the area; and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here.
A 14th-century Mamluk mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around Petra.
Baha'i.
Although his father is described as both an apostle and a prophet,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is merely described as a prophet.
The Kitab-I-Iqan describes  <START:person> Imran <END>  as being his father.
Descendants.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  married  <START:person> Elisheba <END> , daughter of  <START:person> Amminadab <END>  and sister of  <START:person> Nahshon <END>  (Exodus 6:23) of the tribe of  <START:person> Judah <END> .
The sons of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  were  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , Ithamar, and Nadab and  <START:person> Abihu <END> .
A descendant of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is an Aaronite, or  <START:person> Kohen <END> , meaning Priest.
Any non-Aaronic  <START:person> Levite <END> —i.e., descended from  <START:person> Levi <END>  but not from  <START:person> Aaron <END> —assisted the Levitical priests of the family of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the care of the tabernacle; later of the temple.
The Gospel of  <START:person> Luke <END>  records that the priest  <START:person> Zechariah <END> , his wife  <START:person> Elizabeth <END>  and therefore their son  <START:person> John the Baptist <END>  were descendants of  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
Art history.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  appears paired with  <START:person> Moses <END>  frequently in Jewish and Christian art, especially in the illustrations of manuscript and printed Bibles.
He can usually be distinguished by his priestly vestments, especially his turban or miter and jeweled breastplate.
He frequently holds a censor or, sometimes, his flowering rod.
(See at Wikimedia Commons.)
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  also appears in scenes depicting the wilderness Tabernacle and its altar, as already in the third-century frescos in the synagogue at Dura-Europos in Syria.
An eleventh-century portable silver altar from Fulda, Germany depicts  <START:person> Aaron <END>  with his censor, and is located in the Musée National de l’Age Médiévale in Paris.
This is also how he appears in the frontispieces of early printed Passover Haggadot and occasionally in church sculptures.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  has rarely been the subject of portraits, such as those by  <START:person> Anton Kern <END>  [1710–1747] and by  <START:person> Pier Francesco Mola <END>  [c.
1650].
Christian artists sometimes portray  <START:person> Aaron <END>  as a prophet (Exod.
7:1) holding a scroll, as in a twelfth-century sculpture from the Cathedral of Noyon in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and often in Eastern Orthodox icons.
Illustrations of the Golden Calf story usually include him as well—most notably in  <START:person> Nicolas Poussin <END> 's "The Adoration of the Golden Calf" (ca.
1633–34, National Gallery London).
Finally, some artists interested in validating later priesthoods have painted the ordination of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his sons (Leviticus 8).
 <START:person> Harry Anderson <END> 's realistic portrayal is often reproduced in the literature of the Latter Day Saints.

</dl>  Economy of Armenia  Armenia is the second most densely populated of the former Soviet republics because of its small size.
It is situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, bordered on the north and east by Georgia and Azerbaijan and on the south and west by Iran and Turkey.
Until independence, Armenia's economy was based largely on industry—chemicals, electronic products, machinery, processed food, synthetic rubber and textiles; it was highly dependent on outside resources.
Agriculture accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold and lead.
The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant) from Russia; the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric.
Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.
Like other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns.
Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function.
In addition, the effects of the 1988 earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt.
Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved.
The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials.
Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable.
In 1992-93, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level.
The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.
Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years.
New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily Armentel, which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors).
This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans.
Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed $800 million.
These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the earthquake zone.
Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and accelerating privatization.
A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization.
The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization.
By 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005.
Armenia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2003.
Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most smalland medium-sized enterprises.
Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth.
The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under international pressure to close.
The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002.
Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment.
Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector.
The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in 2005, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement.
Investment in the construction and industrial sectors is expected to continue in 2006 and will help to ensure annual average real GDP growth of about 13.9%.
Overview.
Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy.
Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era.
The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology.
The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration.
Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (gold and bauxite) are small.
The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.
By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-99.
Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most smalland medium-sized enterprises.
The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic restructuring and foreign direct investment.
History of the modern Armenian economy.
Armenia emerged from the umbra of the former Soviet Union in 1991 and migrated from a centrally planned economy (Communist system) to a market economy (capitalist system).
Both the nation and the economy are nascent.
Regional conflict retards economic growth.
In addition, the border with Turkey is closed, making access to sea ports difficult and transportation logistics challenging to a country largely dependent upon imports.
In 2003, Armenia became a member of the WTO.
The nation is making substantial progress in privatizing ownership of what used to be state-owned industries under the former Soviet system.
Despite marked progress, Armenia still suffers from a large trade imballance and is still largely dependent upon foreign aid and remittances from Armenian nationals working abroad, and members of the diaspora donating aid through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as churchES.
There are some foreign capital inflows, but no robust foreign investment.
Despite progress since the Soviet era, the unemployment rate still hovers near 30% and there remains a huge gulf between actual and potential Gross Domestic Product.
Global competitiveness.
The Armenian economy's competitiveness is low and stagnating according to the Global Competitiveness Index, in which Armenia's ranking slipped from 80th out of 132 countries in 2006-2007 index to 93rd out of 131 countries in the 2007-2008 index (just below Libya, Namibia, Georgia, Serbia and Pakistan).
Armenia ranks 82nd out of 144 economies according to the 2012-2013 Global Competitiveness Index.
Index of Economic Freedom.
Armenia ranks 39th out of 179 economies according to the 2012 Index of Economic Freedom.
Armenia is ranked 19th freest among the 43 countries in the Europe region, putting it above the world and regional averages.
Domestic business environment.
Armenia ranks 32nd out of 185 economies according to the 2013 ease of doing business index .
Armenia's economy is competitive to a few extent with government-connected individuals enjoying de facto monopolies over the import and distribution of basic commodities and foodstuffs, and under-reporting revenue to avoid paying taxes.
Despite pronouncements at the highest levels of government on the importance of free competition, Armenia is next to last in the effectiveness of its anti-monopoly policy according to the 2010 results of the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.
According to  <START:person> Vahram Nercissiantz <END> , President  <START:person> Serzh Sargsyan <END> 's chief economic adviser, "Businessmen holding state positions have turned into oligarchs who have avoided paying sufficient taxes by abusing their state positions, distorted markets with unequal conditions, breached the rules of competition, impeded or prevented small and medium-sized business’ entry into manufacturing and thereby sharply deepened social polarization in the republic.
Following the advice of economic advisors who cautioned Armenia's leadership against the consolidation of economic power in the hands of a few, in January 2001, the Government of Armenia established the .
Its members cannot be dismissed by the government.
Monopolies.
According to one analyst, Armenia's economic system is anticompetitive due to the structure of the economy being a type of "monopoly or oligopoly".
"The result is the prices with us do not drop even if they do on international market, or they do quite belated and not to the size of the international market."
According to the estimate of a former prime minister,  <START:person> Hrant Bagratian <END> , 55 percent of Armenia's GDP is controlled by 44 families.
In early 2008, the State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition named 60 companies having "dominant positions" in Armenia.
In October 2009, when visiting Yerevan, the World Bank’s managing director, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, warned that Armenia will not reach a higher level of development unless its leadership changes the "oligopolistic" structure of the national economy, bolsters the rule of law and shows "zero tolerance" towards corruption.
"I think you can only go so far with this economic model,"  <START:person> Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala <END>  told a news conference in Yerevan.
"Armenia is a lower middle-income country.
If it wants to become a high-income or upper middle-income country, it can not do so with this kind of economic structure.
That is clear."
She also called for a sweeping reform of tax and customs administration, the creation of a "strong and independent judicial system" as well as a tough fight against government corruption.
The warning was echoed by the International Monetary Fund.
Major monopolies in Armenia include: "Former" major monopolies in Armenia include: GDP.
The Gross Domestic Product of Armenia stood at 8.8 billion US dollars in 2010; with a population of 3.2 million, this amounts to a GDP per capita of $2,676 (purchasing power parity $5,178).
GDP growth for 2010 was at 2.9 percent, and inflation was at 8 percent.
GDP growth is expected to be around 3 percent in 2011, with inflation returning to 4-5 percent.
In comparison, in 2006, the GDP was estimated to be 6.6 billion USD per calendar year and the GDP per capita (purchasing power parity) was estimated at $5,400 US.
The growth rate was high at 13.4%, but the relatively low base must be considered.
Low inflation was maintained around 2.6% annually.
Growth.
After a decade of double-digit growth, Armenia's economy declined by 14.4 percent in 2009.
The year-to-date growth as of October 2010 was 2.8 percent.
In 2010, the main macro deficiencies of the Armenian economy — namely, unsustainable growth drivers, a narrow and resource-dominated export base, and overdependence on private transfers — were still prevalent.
According to official figures, Armenia’s economy grew by 13.8 percent in 2007.
According to research funded by the USAID CAPS project, Armenia's exceptionally high rate of economic growth during the last decade has been largely dependent on external factors (e.g., remittances, assistance from international financial and donor organization).
Furthermore, the study concluded that despite its record growth on most macro-economic metrics, Armenia is "low and lagging" in competitiveness.
According to the National Statistical Service, the booming construction and service sectors remain the driving forces of the high growth rate of GDP.
Cash remittances.
Cash remittances sent back home from Armenians working abroad—mostly in Russia and the United States—are growing and contribute significantly to Armenia's Gross Domestic Product (between 15 to 30 percent).
They help Armenia sustain double-digit economic growth and finance its massive trade deficit.
According to the Central Bank of Armenia, during the first half of 2008, cash remittances sent back to Armenia by Armenians working abroad rose by 57.5 percent and totaled $668.6 million USD, equivalent to 15 percent of the country's first-half Gross Domestic Product.
However, the latter figures only represent cash remittances processed through Armenian commercial banks.
According to RFE/RL, comparable sums are believed to be transferred through non-bank systems, implying that cash remittances make up approximately 30 percent of Armenia's GDP in the first half of 2008.
In 2007, cash remittances through bank transfers rose by 37 percent to a record-high level of $1.32 billion USD.
According to the Central Bank of Armenia, in 2005, cash remittances from Armenians working abroad reached a record-high level of $1 billion, which is worth more than one fifth of the country’s 2005 Gross Domestic Product.
Net private transfers decreased in 2009, but saw a continuous increase during the first six months of 2010.
Since private transfers from the Diaspora tend to be mostly injected into consumption of imports and not in high value-added sectors, the transfers have not resulted in sizeable increases in productivity.
Secondary sector.
Armenia experienced a construction boom during the latter part of the 2000s.
According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's booming construction sector generated about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP during the first eight months of 2007.
According to a World Bank official, 30 percent of Armenia's economy in 2009 came from the construction sector.
However, during the January to September 2010 period, the sector experienced a 5.2 percent year-on-year decrease, which according to the Civilitas Foundation is an indication of the unsustainability of a sector based on an elite market, with few products for the median or low budgets.
This decrease comes despite the fact that an important component of the government stimulus package was to support the completion of ongoing construction projects.
Retail trade.
In 2010, retail trade turnover was largely unaltered compared to 2009.
The existing monopolies throughout the retail sector have made the sector non-responsive to the crisis and resulted in near zero growth.
The aftermath of the crisis has started to shift the structure in the retail sector in favor of food products.
Services sector.
In the 2000s, along with the construction sector, the services sector was the driving force behind Armenia's recent high economic growth rate.
In 2010, the volume of services increased as much as 7.4 percent from January to September, over the same period in 2009.
Tourism.
According to official data, in 2007, a record-high 500,000 tourists visited Armenia — most of them ethnic Armenians from Europe, Russia and the United States.
2010 saw a noticeable increase in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Armenia – estimated to be 80,000.
However, according to private tour operators and other individuals familiar with the country’s tourism industry, government claims that hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Armenia each year are inflated.
Official statistics show that as many 575,000 tourists visited Armenia from abroad in 2009; the government stated earlier in 2010 that the figure will surpass 620,000 in 2010.
However, data from the National Statistical Service shows that there were only 65,000 foreigners staying in Armenian hotels in 2009.
 <START:person> Ara Vartanian <END> , the chairman of the Armenian Trade and Industry Chamber, thinks that this measure is a far more objective indicator of the tourist influx into the country.
In 2012, as many as 843'330 tourists visited Armenia.
Industrial sector.
Industrial output was relatively positive throughout 2010, with year-on-year average growth of 10.9 percent in the period January to September 2010, due largely to the mining sector where higher global demand for commodities led to higher prices.
According to the National Statistical Service, during the January–August 2007 period, Armenia's industrial sector was the single largest contributor to the country's GDP, but remained largely stagnant with industrial output increasing only by 1.7 percent per year.
In 2005, Armenia's industrial output (including electricity) made up about 30 percent of GDP.
Mining.
40 percent of Armenia's exports in 2009 were mining exports.
Agricultural sector.
As of 2010, the agricultural production comprises on average 25 percent of Armenia's GDP.
In 2006, the agricultural sector accounted for about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP.
Armenia's agricultural output dropped by 17.9 percent in the period of January–September 2010.
This was owing to bad weather, a lack of a government stimulus package, and the continuing effects of decreased agricultural subsidies by the Armenian government (per WTO requirements).
Foreign aid.
United States.
The Armenian government receives foreign aid from the government of the United States through the United States Agency for International Development and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.
On March 27, 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $235.65 million compact with the Government of Armenia.
The single stated goal of the "Armenian Compact" is "the reduction of rural poverty through a sustainable increase in the economic performance of the agricultural sector."
The compact includes a $67 million to rehabilitate up to 943 kilometers of rural roads, more than a third of Armenia's proposed "Lifeline road network".
The Compact also includes a $146 million project to increase the productivity of approximately 250,000 farm households through improved water supply, higher yields, higher-value crops, and a more competitive agricultural sector.
In 2010, the volume of US assistance to Armenia remained near 2009 levels; however, longer-term decline continued.
The original Millennium Challenge Account commitment for $235 million had been reduced to about $175 million due to Armenia’s poor governance record.
Thus, the MCC would not complete road construction.
Instead, the irrigated agriculture project was headed for completion with apparently no prospects for extension beyond 2011.
European Union.
With curtailment of the MCC funding, the European Union may replace the US as Armenia’s chief source of foreign aid for the first time since independence.
From 2011 to 2013, the European Union is expected to advance at least €157.3 million ($208 million) in aid to Armenia.
External trade.
Exports.
In 2010, Armenia’s exports remained resource-dependent, largely because the non-resource-intensive sectors were significantly less competitive.
Armenia has not succeeded in increasing and diversifying exports beyond raw materials thus leaving room for a greater vulnerability to external shocks.
There was a 43.9 percent increase in overall exports during the January to September period.
The main three export destinations were Bulgaria with 15.2 percent of total exports, followed by Germany with 14.2 percent and Russia with 13.9 percent.
Raw minerals were the main export sent to Bulgaria and Germany.
Imports.
The global economic crisis has had less impact on imports because the sector is more diversified than exports.
In the first nine months of 2010, imports grew about 19 percent, just about equal to the decline of the same sector in 2009.
Deficit.
During the first half of 2008, Armenia's widening current-account trade deficit grew by 66 percent to $1.39 billion USD, with a 40 percent rise in imports.
Furthermore, Armenian exports fell by about one percent to $520 million USD.
According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's trade deficit in 2006 was $1.2 billion with growth in exports being largely flat.
During the first 11 months of 2006, net imports grew by 21 percent to $1.95 billion, while exports stood at $895 million, up 0.3 percent from the same period in 2005.
Partners.
European Union.
In 2010, EU countries accounted for 32.1 percent of Armenia’s foreign trade.
Germany is Armenia’s largest trading partner among EU member states, accounting for 7.2 percent of trade; this is due largely to mining exports.
Armenian exports to EU countries have skyrocketed by 65.9 percent, making up more than half of all 2010 January to September exports.
Imports from EU countries increased by 17.1 percent, constituting 22.5 percent of all imports.
During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with the European Union totaled $200 million.
During the first 11 months of 2006, the European Union remained Armenia's largest trading partner, accounting for 34.4 percent of its $2.85 billion commercial exchange during the 11-month period.
Russia and former Soviet republics.
Bilateral trade with Russia stood at more than $700 million for the first nine months of 2010 – on track to rebound to $1 billion mark first reached in 2008 prior to the global economic crisis.
During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with Russia and other former Soviet republics was $205.6 million (double the amount from the same period the previous year), making them the country’s number one trading partner.
During the first 11 months of 2006, the volume of Armenia’s trade with Russia was $376.8 million or 13.2 percent of the total commercial exchange.
China.
As of early 2011, trade with China is dominated by imports of Chinese goods and accounts for about 10 percent of Armenia's foreign trade.
The volume of Chinese-Armenian trade soared by 55 percent to $390 million in January–November 2010.
Armenian exports to China, though still modest in absolute terms, nearly doubled in that period.
Iran.
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Iran was $200 million which is approximately equal to the trade between Armenia and Turkey.
The number of Iranian tourists has risen in recent years, with an estimated 80,000 Iranian tourists in 2010.
Turkey.
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Turkey was about $200 million, with trade taking place without open borders, across Georgian territory.
This figure is not expected to increase significantly so long as the land border between the Armenia and Turkey remains closed.
United States.
From January–September 2010, bilateral trade with the United States measured approximately $150 million, on track for about a 30 percent increase over 2009.
An increase in Armenia’s exports to the US in 2009 and 2010 has been due to shipments of aluminum foil.
During the first 11 months of 2006, U.S.-Armenian trade totaled $152.6 million.
Georgia.
The volume of Georgian-Armenian trade remains modest in both relative and absolute terms.
According to official Armenian statistics, it rose by 11 percent to $91.6 million in January–November 2010.
The figure was equivalent to just over 2 percent of Armenia’s overall foreign trade.
Foreign debt.
Armenia's national debt has increased significantly since 2008 when public external debt consisted of only 13.5 percent of GDP.
By the end of 2010, Armenia’s external debt is projected to form about 42 percent of GDP, and 50 percent in 2012.
As of late November 2009, the Armenian government's foreign debt was around $3 billion USD, having doubled in size over the course of the previous year.
With the Armenian government needing more anti-crisis loans from the World Bank and other foreign donors, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to exceed 40 percent in 2010.
According to a World Bank official, a country that has around 12 percent rate of growth or even lower, at the range of 7 to 8 percent, can afford a level of public debt of up to 50 percent.
The official warned that the debt servicing payments of the Armenian government will surge by 2013 and absorb "quite significant part of tax revenues."
According to another estimate, the ratio between the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the state's foreign debt has reached 46 percent.
Economists generally agree that a country is insolvent, if its foreign debt surpasses 50 percent of its GDP.
Critics of the government say that the $500 million credit from Russia should have gone to develop industry, instead of going to the construction sector.
Transportation routes and energy lines.
Internal.
Since early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway.
Through Georgia.
Russian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.
The only operational rail link into Armenia is from Georgia.
During Soviet times, Armenia's rail network connected to Russia's via Georgia through Abkhazia along the Black Sea.
However, the rail link between Abkhazia and Georgia proper has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports.
The Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi and  <START:person> Poti <END>  process more than 90 percent of freight shipped to and from landlocked Armenia.
The Georgian railway, which runs through the town of Gori in central Georgia, is the main transport link between Armenia and the aforementioned Georgian seaports.
Fuel, wheat and other basic commodities are transported to Armenia by rail.
Armenia's main rail and road border-crossing with Georgia (at ) is along the Debed river near the Armenian town of Bagratashen and the Georgian town of Sadakhlo.
The Upper Lars border crossing (at Darial Gorge) between Georgia and Russia across the Caucasus Mountains served as Armenia's sole overland route to the former Soviet Union and Europe.
It was controversially shut down by the Russian authorities in June 2006, at the height of a Russian-Georgian spy scandal.
Upper  <START:person> Lars <END>  is the only land border crossing that does not go through Georgia's Russian-backed breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The other two roads linking Georgia and Russia run through South Ossetia and Abkhazia, effectively barring them to international traffic.
This crossing is expected to reopen starting on March 1, 2010.
Through Turkey and Azerbaijan.
An economic blockade with Turkey and Azerbaijan has cut Armenia's rail link between  <START:person> Gyumri <END>  and Kars to Turkey; the rail link with Iran through the Azeri exclave of Nakhichevan; and a natural gas and oil pipeline line with Azerbaijan.
Also non-functioning are roads with Turkey and Azerbaijan.
Despite the economic blockade of Turkey on Armenia, every day dozens of Turkish trucks laden with goods enter Armenia through Georgia.
In 2010, it was confirmed that Turkey will keep the border closed for the foreseeable future after the Turkey-Armenia normalization process collapsed.
Through Iran.
A new gas pipeline to Iran has been completed, and a road to Iran through the southern city of Meghri allows trade with that country.
An oil pipeline to pump Iranian oil products is also in the planning stages.
As of October 2008, the Armenian government is considering implementing an ambitious project to build a railway to Iran.
The 400 kilometer railway would pass through Armenia's mountainous southern province of Syunik, which borders Iran.
Economic analysts say that the project would cost at least $1 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of Armenia's 2008 state budget).
As of 2010, the project has been continuously delayed, with the rail link estimated to cost as much as $4 billion and stretch 313 km.
In June 2010, Transport Minister  <START:person> Manuk Vartanian <END>  revealed that Yerevan is seeking as much as $1 billion in loans from China to finance the railway’s construction.
Labor.
Monthly wages.
According to the state-owned Armenpress news agency, the average monthly wage in Armenia for the first half of 2007 was 70,700 drams (about $210 USD).
As of April 24, 2008, the average monthly salary is 75,000 drams (about $242 US dollars).
According to the ROA National Statistical Service, the average monthly salary during January June 2008 is 86,850 drams (about $287 at the time).
About 62% of officially registered wage earners earn at least the average monthly wage, while only 19.6% receive a monthly salary of over 100,000 drams (about $330 at the time).
Unemployment.
According to research commissioned by the Yerevan office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), at least one in three working-age Armenians was unemployed as of February 2005 despite several consecutive years of double-digit economic growth.
The finding sharply contrasts with government's official unemployment rate of about 10 percent.
A 2003 household survey conducted by the National Statistical Survey found that the real unemployment rate is about 33 percent.
Migrant workers.
Since gaining independence in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Armenia's residents have gone abroad, mainly to Russia, in search of work.
Unemployment has been the major cause of this massive labor emigration.
OSCE experts estimate that between 116,000 and 147,000 people left Armenia for economic reasons between 2002 and 2004, with two-thirds of them returning home by February 2005.
According to estimates by the National Statistical Survey, the rate of labor emigration was twice as higher in 2001 and 2002.
According to an OSCE survey, a typical Armenian migrant worker is a married man aged between 41 and 50 years who "began looking for work abroad at the age of 32-33."
Appreciation and depreciation of the dram.
In 2010, the value of the Armenian Dram (AMD) was artificially kept high during the height of the global economic crisis.
Had the AMD been allowed to depreciate to its market level, exports would have become more competitive and the purchasing power of the majority of the population who are dependent on remittances from abroad would have increased.
Instead, the value of the AMD was kept high, out of a fear of inflation and concern about alienating the powerful government-connected importers of oil, sugar, flour, cigarettes and beverages.
The AMD/USD exchange rate depreciated by 6.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, before it began to show the expected end-of-the-year appreciation.
In comparison between the January to October periods of 2010 and 2009, depreciation stands at 4.7 percent.
Government revenue and taxation.
The Armenian government collected 383.5 billion drams ($1.26 billion) in various taxes in the first nine months of 2008 (a 33.2 percent increase from the same period last year).
Many large companies have a privileged status when it comes to taxation.
Big business is not taxed in proportion to its capacity and output, and the disproportionate burden falls on small and medium size businesses.
New value-added tax.
Over half of the tax revenues in the January–August 2008 time period were generated from value-added taxes (VAT).
By comparison, corporate profit tax generated less than 16 percent of the revenues.
This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens, rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenia's double-digit economic growth in recent years).
Tax evasion.
Many Armenian companies, especially those owned by government-connected tycoons, have long reported suspiciously low earnings, thereby avoiding paying larger taxes.
Environmental issues.
Armenia is trying to "address its environmental problems".
It has established a Ministry of Environment and has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal.The resulting revenues are used for unknown purposes.
Armenia doesn't seem to be interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (a group of 12 former Soviet republics) or with members of the international community on environmental issues.
The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant and has already made an agreement with Russian "businessmen" about the construction and operation and ownage of a new Nuclear power plant.
Banking.
Armenia's financial system is not integrated into the global network.
According to the head of the Armenian Central Bank’s (CBA) department for financial system policies and analyses ( <START:person> Vahe Vardanyan <END> ) Armenian banks have no large asset concentrations in foreign markets, particularly in capital markets.
They nearly have no purchased securities (so-called securitized packages).
For this reason, Armenia was virtually unaffected by the Liquidity crisis of September 2008.
Armenian banking assets are very low and make up only 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Takeover of Armenian industrial property by the Russian state and Russian companies.
Since 2000, the Russian state has acquired several key assets in the energy sector and Soviet-era industrial plants.
Property-for-debt or equity-for-debt swaps (acquiring ownership by simply writing off the Armenian government's debts to Russia) are usually the method of acquiring assets.
The failure of market reforms, clan-based economics, and official corruption in Armenia have allowed the success of this process.
In August 2002, the Armenian government sold an 80 percent stake in the Armenian Electricity Network (AEN) to Midland Resources, a British offshore-registered firm which is said to have close Russian connections.
In September 2002, the Armenian government handed over Armenia’s largest cement factory to the Russian ITERA gas exporter in payment for its $10 million debt for past gas deliveries.
On November 5, 2002, Armenia transferred control of 5 state enterprises to Russia in an assets-for-debts transaction which settled $100 million of Armenian state debts to Russia.
The document was signed for Russia by Prime Minister  <START:person> Mikhail Kasyanov <END>  and Industry Minister  <START:person> Ilya Klebanov <END> , while Prime Minister  <START:person> Andranik Markarian <END>  and National Security Council Secretary  <START:person> Serge Sarkisian <END>  signed for Armenia.
The five enterprises which passed to 100 percent Russian state ownership are: In January 2003, the Armenian government and United Company RUSAL signed an investment cooperation agreement, under which United Company RUSAL (which already owned a 76% stake) acquired the Armenian government's remaining 26% share of RUSAL ARMENAL aluminum foil mill, giving RUSAL 100% ownership of RUSAL ARMENAL.
On November 1, 2006, the Armenian government handed de facto control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline to Russian company Gazprom and increased Gazprom's stake in the Russian-Armenian company ArmRosGazprom from 45% to 58% by approving an additional issue of shares worth $119 million.
This left the Armenian government with a 32% stake in ArmRosGazprom.
The transaction will also help finance ArmRosGazprom's acquisition of the Hrazdan electricity generating plant’s fifth power bloc (Hrazdan-5), the leading unit in the country.
In October 2008 the Russian bank Gazprombank, the banking arm of Gazprom, acquired 100 percent of Armenian bank Areximbank after previously buying 80 percent of said bank in November 2007 and 94.15 percent in July of the same year.
Controversy over non-transparent deals.
Critics of the  <START:person> Kocharian <END>  government say that the Armenian administration never considered alternative ways of settling the Russian debts.
According to economist  <START:person> Eduard Aghajanov <END> , Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million.
Furthermore,  <START:person> Aghajanov <END>  points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector – abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.
Political observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government’s work.
The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and now President)  <START:person> Serge Sarkisian <END> ,  <START:person> Kocharian <END> ’s closest political associate.
Other top government officials, including Prime Minister  <START:person> Andranik Markarian <END> , had little say on the issue.
Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after  <START:person> Sarkisian <END> ’s frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.
Finally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multimillion-dollar debts to Russia over the past decade, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia.
For example, pro-Western Ukraine and Georgia (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.

 <START:person> Alfonso Cuarón  Alfonso Cuarón Orozco <END>  (]; born November 28, 1961) is a Mexican film director, screenwriter, producer and editor best known for his dramas "A Little Princess" (1995) and "Y Tu Mamá También" (2001), the fantasy film " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Prisoner of Azkaban" (2004), and science fiction thrillers "Children of Men" (2006) and "Gravity" (2013).
Cuarón is the first Mexican director to win an Academy Award for Best Directing.
Most of his work has been praised by both audiences and critics, and has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay for "Y Tu Mamá También", and both Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing for "Children of Men".
For "Gravity",  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  received several major accolades for his achievement in direction, winning in the respective categories at the Academy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, the BAFTA Awards and the Directors Guild of America; and in addition winning the BAFTA Award Best British Film and the Academy Award for Best Film Editing (shared with  <START:person> Mark Sanger <END> ).
He has also been awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Film not in the English Language as one of the producers of "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006).
In his films,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  is known for his ground-breaking use in the technique of continuous uninterrupted shots.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's brother  <START:person> Carlos <END> , as well as his son  <START:person> Jonás <END> , are also writers and directors and have both acted as co-writers in some of his works.
He is also friends with fellow Mexican directors  <START:person> Guillermo del Toro <END>  and  <START:person> Alejandro González Iñárritu <END> , collectively known as "The Three Amigos of Cinema."
Early life.
 <START:person> Alfonso Cuarón <END>  was born in Mexico City, and is the son of  <START:person> Alfredo Cuarón <END> , a nuclear physicist who worked for the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency for many years.
He has two brothers,  <START:person> Carlos <END> , also a filmmaker, and  <START:person> Alfredo <END> , a conservation biologist.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  studied Philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC (Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos), a school within the same University.
There, he met director  <START:person> Carlos Marcovich <END>  and cinematographer  <START:person> Emmanuel Lubezki <END> , and they made what would be his first short film, "Vengeance Is Mine".
Career.
Cuarón began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director.
His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions including "" and "Romero", and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.
On January 12, 2014,  <START:person> Alfonso <END>  accepted the Golden Globe Award in the category Best Director for Gravity (The 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards, 2014).
He also won two Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Directing.
"Sólo con tu pareja".
"Sólo con tu pareja" was a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by  <START:person> Daniel Giménez Cacho <END> ) who, after spurning an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted AIDS.
In addition to writing, producing and directing,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  co-edited the film with  <START:person> Luis Patlán <END> .
It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the Coen Brothers and  <START:person> Robert Rodriguez <END>  have both directed and edited nearly all of their films.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.
The film, which also starred cabaret singer  <START:person> Astrid Hadad <END>  and model/actress  <START:person> Claudia Ramírez <END>  (with whom  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico.
After this success, director  <START:person> Sydney Pollack <END>  hired  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  to direct an episode of "Fallen Angels", a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included  <START:person> Steven Soderbergh <END> ,  <START:person> Jonathan Kaplan <END> ,  <START:person> Peter Bogdanovich <END>  and  <START:person> Tom Hanks <END> .
International success.
In 1995,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  released his first feature film produced in the United States, "A Little Princess", an adaptation of  <START:person> Frances Hodgson Burnett <END> 's classic novel.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of  <START:person> Charles Dickens <END> 's "Great Expectations" starring  <START:person> Ethan Hawke <END> , Gwyneth Paltrow and  <START:person> Robert De Niro <END> .
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film "Y Tu Mamá También", starring  <START:person> Gael García Bernal <END> ,  <START:person> Diego Luna <END>  and  <START:person> Maribel Verdú <END> .
It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman in her late twenties.
The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  shared an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay with co-writer and brother  <START:person> Carlos Cuarón <END> .
In 2003,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  directed the third film in the successful "Harry Potter" series, " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  faced criticism from some of the more purist " <START:person> Harry Potter <END> " fans for his approach to the film.
At the time of the movie's release, however, author  <START:person> J. K. Rowling <END> , who had seen and loved  <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's film "Y Tu Mamá También", said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.
Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking that it was the first "Harry Potter" film to truly capture the essence of the novels.
It remained as the most critically acclaimed film of the "Harry Potter" film franchise until the release of " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's feature "Children of Men", an adaptation of the  <START:person> P. D. James <END>  novel starring  <START:person> Clive Owen <END> ,  <START:person> Julianne Moore <END>  and  <START:person> Michael Caine <END> , received wide critical acclaim, including three Academy Award nominations.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  himself received two nominations for his work on the film in Best Film Editing (with  <START:person> Alex Rodríguez <END> ) and Best Adapted Screenplay (with several collaborators).
He created the production and distribution company Esperanto Filmoj ("Esperanto Films", named because of his support for the international language Esperanto), which has credits in the films "Duck Season", "Pan's Labyrinth", and "Gravity".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  also directed the controversial public service announcement "I Am Autism" for Autism Speaks that was sharply criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.
In 2010,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  began to develop the film "Gravity", a drama set in space.
He was joined by producer  <START:person> David Heyman <END> , with whom  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  worked on " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
Starring  <START:person> Sandra Bullock <END>  and  <START:person> George Clooney <END> , the film was released in the fall of 2013 and opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival in August.
The film received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Directing.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  won for Best Directing, becoming the first Latin American to win the award, while he and  <START:person> Mark Sanger <END>  shared the award for Best Film Editing.
In 2013,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  created "Believe", a science fiction/fantasy/adventure series that is being broadcast as part of the 2013–14 United States network television schedule on NBC as a mid-season entry.
The series was created by Cuarón for Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television.
In 2014, "TIME" placed him in its list of "100 Most Influential People in the World" Pioneers.
In May 2015  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  was announced as the President of the Jury for the 72nd Venice International Film Festival.
Personal life.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  has been living in London since 2000.
He was married to Italian actress and freelance journalist  <START:person> Annalisa Bugliani <END>  from 2001 to 2008.
They have two children: daughter  <START:person> Tess Bu Cuarón <END>  (born 2003) and son  <START:person> Olmo Teodoro Cuarón <END>  (born 2005).
Anisotropy  Anisotropy is the property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to isotropy, which implies identical properties in all directions.
It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc.)
An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a polarizer.
Another is wood, which is easier to split along its grain than against it.
Fields of interest.
Computer graphics.
In the field of computer graphics, an anisotropic surface changes in appearance as it rotates about its geometric normal, as is the case with velvet.
Anisotropic filtering (AF) is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view.
Older techniques, such as bilinear and trilinear filtering, do not take into account the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in aliasing or blurring of textures.
By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.
Chemistry.
A chemical anisotropic filter, as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the proximal regions filter out larger particles and distal regions increasingly remove smaller particles, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.
In NMR spectroscopy, the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their chemical shift.
In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of benzene.
This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.
In fluorescence spectroscopy, the fluorescence anisotropy, calculated from the polarization properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane-polarized light, is used, e.g., to determine the shape of a macromolecule.
Anisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon.
Real-world imagery.
Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).
Physics.
Physicists from University of California, Berkeley reported about their detection of the cosine anisotropy in cosmic microwave background radiation in 1977.
Their experiment demonstrated the Doppler shift caused by the movement of the earth with respect to the early Universe matter, the source of the radiation.
Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies' rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.
Physicists use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials.
Magnetic anisotropy, for example, may occur in a plasma, so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction.
Plasmas may also show "filamentation" (such as that seen in lightning or a plasma globe) that is directional.
An "anisotropic liquid" has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or chloroform, which contain no structural ordering of the molecules.
Liquid crystals are examples of anisotropic liquids.
Some materials conduct heat in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source.
Heat conduction is more commonly anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required.
The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in electronics are often anisotropic.
Many crystals are anisotropic to light ("optical anisotropy"), and exhibit properties such as birefringence.
Crystal optics describes light propagation in these media.
An "axis of anisotropy" is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken (or an axis of symmetry, such as normal to crystalline layers).
Some materials can have multiple such optical axes.
Geology and geophysics.
Seismic anisotropy is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction.
Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic wavelength (e.g., crystals, cracks, pores, layers or inclusions) have a dominant alignment.
This alignment leads to a directional variation of elasticity wavespeed.
Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's crust, mantle and inner core.
Geological formations with distinct layers of sedimentary material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; electrical conductivity in one direction (e.g.
parallel to a layer), is different from that in another (e.g.
perpendicular to a layer).
This property is used in the gas and oil exploration industry to identify hydrocarbon-bearing sands in sequences of sand and shale.
Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high resistivity (low conductivity), whereas shales have lower resistivity.
Formation evaluation instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas in wells.
The hydraulic conductivity of aquifers is often anisotropic for the same reason.
When calculating groundwater flow to drains or to wells, the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability must be taken into account, otherwise the results may be subject to error.
Most common rock-forming minerals are anisotropic, including quartz and feldspar.
Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their optical properties.
An example of an isotropic mineral is garnet.
Medical acoustics.
Anisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting echogenicity of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed.
Tendon fibers appear hyperechoic (bright) when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon, but can appear hypoechoic (darker) when the transducer is angled obliquely.
This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners.
Material science and engineering.
Anisotropy, in Material Science, is a material’s directional dependence of a physical property.
Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior.
An example would be the dependence of  <START:person> Young <END> 's modulus on the direction of load.
Anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can also be due to certain texture patterns often produced during manufacturing of the material.
In the case of rolling, "stringers" of texture are produced in the direction of rolling, which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions.
Some materials, such as wood and fibre-reinforced composites are very anisotropic, being much stronger along the grain/fibre than across it.
Metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic, though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour.
This is especially important in processes such as deep-drawing.
Wood is a naturally anisotropic (transversely isotropic) material.
Its properties vary widely when measured with or against the growth grain.
For example, wood's strength and hardness is different for the same sample measured in different orientations.
Microfabrication.
Anisotropic etching techniques (such as deep reactive ion etching) are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high aspect ratio.
These features are commonly used in MEMS and microfluidic devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device.
Anisotropic etching can also refer to certain chemical etchants used to etch a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes (e.g., KOH etching of silicon [100] produces pyramid-like structures) Neuroscience.
Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that involves measuring the fractional anisotropy of the random motion (Brownian motion) of water molecules in the brain.
Water molecules located in fiber tracts are more likely to be anisotropic, since they are restricted in their movement (they move more in the dimension parallel to the fiber tract rather than in the two dimensions orthogonal to it), whereas water molecules dispersed in the rest of the brain have less restricted movement and therefore display more isotropy.
This difference in fractional anisotropy is exploited to create a map of the fiber tracts in the brains of the individual.
Atmospheric Radiative Transfer.
Radiance fields (see BRDF) from a reflective surface are often not isotropic in nature.
This makes calculations of the total energy being reflected from any scene a difficult quantity to calculate.
In remote sensing applications, anisotropy functions can be derived for specific scenes, immensely simplifying the calculation of the net reflectance or (thereby) the net irradiance of a scene.
For example, let the BRDF be formula_1 where 'i' denotes incident direction and 'v' denotes viewing direction (as if from a satellite or other instrument).
And let P be the Planar Albedo, which represents the total reflectance from the scene.
It is of interest because, with knowledge of the anisotropy function as defined, a measurement of the BRDF from a single viewing direction (say, formula_4) yields a measure of the total scene reflectance ( <START:person> Planar Albedo <END> ) for that specific incident geometry (say,formula_5).
Abalone  Abalone ( or ; via Spanish "abulón", from the Rumsen language "aulón") is a common name for any of a group of small to very large edible sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Haliotidae.
Other common names are ear shells, sea ears, and muttonfish or muttonshells in Australia, ormer in Great Britain, and pāua in New Zealand.
The family Haliotidae contains only one genus, "Haliotis", which used to contain 6 subgenera.
These subgenera have become alternate representations of "Haliotis".
The number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30 and 130 with over 230 species-level taxa described.
The most comprehensive treatment of the family considers 56 species valid, with 18 additional subspecies.
The shells of abalones have a low open spiral structure, and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shell's outer edge.
The thick inner layer of the shell is composed of nacre (mother-of-pearl), which in many species is highly iridescent, giving rise to a range of strong changeable colors, which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects, jewelry, and as a source of colorful mother-of-pearl.
The flesh of abalones is widely considered to be a desirable food, and is consumed raw or cooked in a variety of cultures.
Description.
The shell of abalones is convex, rounded to oval shape, and may be highly arched or very flattened.
The shell of the majority of species is ear-shaped, presenting a small flat spire and two to three whorls.
The last whorl, known as the body whorl, is auriform, meaning that the shell resembles an ear, giving rise to the common name "ear shell".
"Haliotis asinina" has a somewhat different shape, as it is more elongated and distended.
The shell of "Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii" is also unusual as it has an ovate form, is imperforate, shows an exserted spire, and has prickly ribs.
A mantle cleft in the shell impresses a groove in the shell, in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus.
These holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column.
They make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows.
This series of 8 to 38 holes is near the anterior margin.
Only a small number are generally open.
The older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form.
Each species has a typical number of open holes, between four and ten, in the selenizone.
Abalone have no operculum.
The aperture of the shell is very wide and nacreous.
The exterior of the shell is striated and dull.
The color of the shell is very variable from species to species which may reflect the animal's diet.
The iridescent nacre that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white, to pink, red and green-red to deep blue, green to purple.
The animal shows fimbriated head-lobes.
The side-lobes are also fimbriated and cirrated.
The rounded foot is very large.
The radula has small median teeth, and the lateral teeth are single and beam-like.
There are about 70 uncini, with denticulated hooks, the first four very large.
The soft body is coiled around the columellar muscle, and its insertion, instead of being on the columella, is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell.
The gills are symmetrical and both well developed.
These snails cling solidly with their broad muscular foot to rocky surfaces at sublittoral depths, although some species such as "Haliotis cracherodii" used to be common in the intertidal zone.
Abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size.
Their fecundity is high and increases with their size (from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time).
The spermatozoa are filiform and pointed at one end, and the anterior end is a rounded head.
The larvae are lecithotrophic.
The adults are herbivorous and feed with their rhipidoglossan radula on macroalgae, preferring red or brown algae.
Sizes vary from 20 mm ("Haliotis pulcherrima") to 200 mm while "Haliotis rufescens" is the largest of the genus at 12 in.
Abalones are herbivorous on hard substrata.
By weight, approximately 1/3 of the animal is edible meat, 1/3 is offal, and 1/3 is shell.
Distribution.
The haliotid family has a worldwide distribution, along the coastal waters of every continent, except the Pacific coast of South America, the East Coast of the United States, the Arctic, and Antarctica The majority of abalone species are found in cold waters, such as off the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Western North America, and Japan.
Structure and properties of the shell.
The shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic calcium carbonate tiles stacked like bricks.
Between the layers of tiles is a clingy protein substance.
When the abalone shell is struck, the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow.
Material scientists around the world are studying this tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as body armor.
The dust created by grinding and cutting abalone shell is dangerous; appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles.
Diseases and pests.
Abalones are subject to various diseases.
The Victorian Department of Primary Industries said in 2007 that ganglioneuritis, or AVG, killed up to 90% of stock in affected regions.
Abalone are also severe hemophiliacs as their fluids will not clot in the case of a laceration or puncture wound.
Members of the Spionidae family of the polychaetes are known as pests of abalone.
Human use.
The meat (foot muscle) of abalone is used for food, and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as a source of mother of pearl for jewelry, buttons, buckles, and inlay.
Abalone shells have been found in archaeological sites around the world, ranging from 75,000 year old deposits at Blombos Cave in South Africa to historic Chinese abalone middens on California's Northern Channel Islands.
On the Channel Islands, where abalones were harvested by Native Americans for at least 12,000 years, the size of red abalone shells found in middens declines significantly after about 4000 years ago, probably due to human predation.
Worldwide, abalone pearls have also been collected for centuries.
Farming.
Farming of abalone began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Japan and China.
Since the mid-1990s, there have been many increasingly successful endeavors to commercially farm abalone for the purpose of consumption.
Over-fishing and poaching have reduced wild populations to such an extent that farmed abalone now supplies most of the abalone meat consumed.
The principal abalone farming regions are China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea.
Abalone is also farmed in Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States.
Consumption.
Abalone have long been a valuable food source for humans in every area of the world where a species is abundant.
The meat of this mollusc is considered a delicacy in certain parts of Latin America (especially Chile), France, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and East Asia (especially in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea).
In Chinese speaking regions, abalone are commonly known as bao yu, and sometimes form part of a Chinese banquet .
In the same way as shark fin soup or bird's nest soup, abalone is considered a luxury item, and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations .
However, the availability of commercially farmed abalone has allowed more common consumption of this once rare delicacy .
Abalone started to become popular after the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1915.
As Abalone became more popular and less common, the prices have adjusted accordingly.
In the 1920s a restaurant served portion of abalone, about 4 ounces, would cost (in inflation adjusted dollars) about $7, by 2004, the price had skyrocketed to $75.
In America, prior to this time, abalone was predominantly eaten, gathered, and prepared, by Chinese immigrants.
By 1900, laws were passed in California to outlaw the taking of abalone above the intertidal zone.
This forced the Chinese out of the market and the Japanese perfected diving, with or without gear, to enter the market.
By the time of the exposition, Americans were starting to discover abalone.
The popularity of abalone, along with many other fish and shellfish, increased as the expo exhibited 365 varieties of fish with cooking demonstrations, and a 1300-seat dining hall.
In Japan, live and raw abalone are used in awabi sushi, or served steamed, salted, boiled, chopped, or simmered in soy sauce.
Salted, fermented abalone entrails are the main component of tottsuru, a local dish from Honshū.
Tottsuru is mainly enjoyed with sake.
In California, abalone meat can be found on pizza, sautéed with caramelized mango or in steak form dusted with cracker meal and flour.
Sport harvesting.
Australia.
Tasmania supplies approximately 25% of the yearly world abalone harvest.
Around 12,500 Tasmanians recreationally fish for blacklip and greenlip abalone.
For blacklip abalone, the size limit varies from between 138 mm for the southern end of the state and 127 mm for the northern end of the state.
Greenlip abalone have a minimum size of 145 mm, except for an area around  <START:person> Perkin <END> 's Bay in the north of the state where the minimum size is 132 mm.
With a recreational abalone licence, there is a bag limit of 10 per day, and a total possession limit of 20.
Scuba diving for abalone is allowed, and has a rich history in Australia.
(Scuba diving for abalone in the states of New South Wales and Western Australia is illegal; a free-diving catch limit of two is allowed).
 <START:person> Victoria <END>  has had an active abalone fishery since the late 1950s.
The state is sectioned into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western with each fisher required a zone allocated licence.
Harvesting is performed by divers using surface supplied air "hookah" systems operating from runabout style, outboard powered boats.
While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds the deckhand operates the boat, known as working "live" and stays above where the diver is working.
Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of "shot line", where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved.
Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand re-measures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell.
Since 2002 the Victorian Industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch (TAC) reduced from 1440 tonnes to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 fishing year.
This is due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus Ganglioneuritis which is fast spreading and lethal to abalone stocks.
United States.
Sport harvesting of red abalone is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card.
In 2008, the abalone card also came with a set of 24 tags.
This was reduced to 18 abalone per year in 2014, only nine of which may be taken south of Mendocino County.
Legal-size abalone must be tagged immediately.
Abalone may only be taken using breath-hold techniques or shorepicking; scuba diving for abalone is strictly prohibited.
Taking of abalone is not permitted south of the mouth of the San Francisco Bay.
There is a size minimum of 7 in measured across the shell.
A person may be in possession of only three abalone at any given time.
Abalone may only be taken from April to November, not including July.
Transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still attached in the shell.
Sale of sport-obtained abalone is illegal, including the shell.
Only red abalone may be taken as black, white, pink, flat, green, and pinto abalone are protected by law.
An abalone diver is normally equipped with a thick wetsuit, including a hood, bootees, and gloves, and usually also a mask, snorkel, weight belt, abalone iron, and abalone gauge.
Alternatively, the rock picker can feel underneath rocks at low tides for abalone.
Abalone are mostly taken in depths from a few inches up to 10 m; less common are freedivers who can work deeper than 10 m.
Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources such as kelp.
An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it can fully clamp down.
Divers dive out of boats, kayaks, tube floats or directly off the shore.
The largest abalone recorded in California is 12.34 in, caught by  <START:person> John Pepper <END>  somewhere off the coast of San Mateo county in September 1993.
The mollusc "Concholepas concholepas" is often sold in the United States under the name "Chilean abalone", though it is not an abalone, but a muricid.
New Zealand.
In New Zealand, abalone is called pāua (, from the Māori language).
"Haliotis iris" (or blackfoot pāua) is the ubiquitous New Zealand pāua; the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue, green, and purple iridescence.
"Haliotis australis" and "Haliotis virginea" are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than "H.
iris".
Like all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of pāua does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) are followed.
The legal recreational daily limit is 10 pāua per diver, with a minimum shell length of 125 mm for "Haliotis iris" and 80 mm for "Haliotis australis".
In addition, no person may be in possession, even on land, of more than 20 pāua or more than 2.5 kg of pāua meat at any one time.
Pāua can only be caught by free-diving; it is illegal to catch pāua using scuba gear.
There is an extensive global black market in collecting and exporting abalone meat.
This can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest pāua can be granted legally under Māori customary rights.
When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police.
The limit is strictly enforced by roving Ministry for Primary Industries fishery officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police.
Pāua poaching is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized.
Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases, imprisonment.
The Ministry of Fisheries expects in the year 2004/05, nearly 1,000 tons of pāua will be poached, with 75% of that being undersized.
South Africa.
The largest abalone in South Africa, "Haliotis midae", occurs along approximately two-thirds of the country’s coastline.
Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting.
In South Africa all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually, and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear.
For the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone, but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by syndicates.
In 2007, because of widespread poaching of abalone, the South African government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the CITES section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species.
This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls.
Export permits are still required, however.
The abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries.
As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram.
There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne.
Channel Islands.
Ormers ("Haliotis tuberculata") are considered a delicacy in the British Channel Islands as well as in adjacent areas of France, and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals.
This has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century, and "ormering" is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks.
The gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from January 1 to April 30, which occur on the full or new moon and two days following.
No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under 80 mm in shell length.
Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater.
Any breach of these laws is a criminal offense and can lead to fine of up to £5,000 or six months in prison.
The demand for ormers is such that they led to the world's first underwater arrest, when Mr.  <START:person> Kempthorne-Leigh <END>  of Guernsey was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear when illegally diving for ormers.
Decorative items.
The highly iridescent inner nacre layer of the shell of abalone has traditionally been used as a decorative item, in jewelry, buttons, and as inlay in furniture and in musical instruments such as guitars, etc. Abalone pearl jewelry is very popular in New Zealand and Australia, in no minor part due to the marketing and farming efforts of pearl companies.
Unlike the Oriental Natural, the Akoya pearl, and the South Sea and Tahitian cultured pearls, abalone pearls are not primarily judged by their roundness.
The inner shell of the abalone is an iridescent swirl of intense colours, ranging from deep cobalt blue and peacock green to purples, creams and pinks.
Therefore each pearl, natural or cultured, will have its own unique collage of colours.
The shells of abalone are occasionally used in New Age smudging ceremonies to catch falling ash.
They have also been used as incense burners.
Threat of extinction.
Abalones have been identified as one of the many classes of organism threatened with extinction due to overfishing, acidification of oceans from anthropogenic carbon dioxide, as reduced pH erodes their shells.
It is predicted that abalones will become extinct in the wild within 200 years at current rates of carbon dioxide production.
Species.
The number of species that are recognized within the genus "Haliotis" has fluctuated over time, and depends on the source that is consulted.
The number of recognized species range from 30 to 130.
This list finds a compromise using the "WoRMS database", plus some species that have been added, for a total of 57.
The majority of abalone have not been rated for conservation status.
Those that have been reviewed tend to show that the abalone in general is an animal that is declining in numbers, and will need protection throughout the globe.

He was consular prefect of Liguria and  <START:person> Emilia <END> , headquartered in Milan, before being made bishop of Milan by popular acclamation in 374.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was a staunch opponent of Arianism, and has been accused of fostering persecutions of Arians, Jews, and pagans.
Traditionally,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is credited with promoting "antiphonal chant", a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing "Veni redemptor gentium", a Christmas hymn.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was one of the four original doctors of the Church, and is the patron saint of Milan.
He is notable for his influence on St. Augustine.
Life.
Early life.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was born into a Roman Christian family about 340 AD and was raised in  <START:person> Trier <END> .
His father was  <START:person> Aurelius Ambrosius <END> , the praetorian prefect of  <START:person> Gaul <END> ; his mother was a woman of intellect and piety.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's siblings,  <START:person> Satyrus <END>  (who is the subject of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's "De excessu fratris Satyri") and  <START:person> Marcellina <END> , are also venerated as saints.
There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of bees settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of honey.
His father considered this a sign of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue.
For this reason, bees and beehives often appear in the saint's symbology.
After the early death of his father,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  followed his father's career.
He was educated in Rome, studying literature, law, and rhetoric.
Praetorian prefect  <START:person> Probus <END>  first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him consular prefect or "Governor" of Liguria and  <START:person> Emilia <END> , with headquarters at Milan, which was then (beside Rome) the second capital in Italy.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374 when he became the Bishop of Milan.
He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of the Emperor  <START:person> Valentinian I. Ambrose <END>  never married.
Bishop of Milan.
In the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the diocese of Milan between the Catholics and Arians.
In 374 the bishop of Milan,  <START:person> Auxentius <END> , an  <START:person> Arian <END> , died, and the  <START:person> Arians <END>  challenged the succession.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis.
His address was interrupted by a call "Ambrose, bishop!", which was taken up by the whole assembly.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was known to be Catholic in belief, but also acceptable to  <START:person> Arians <END>  due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard.
At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared:  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was neither baptized nor formally trained in theology.
Upon his appointment,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide.
Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor  <START:person> Gratian <END>  praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions,  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's host gave him up.
Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of Milan.
As bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister  <START:person> Marcellina <END>  (who later became a nun), and committed the care of his family to his brother.
This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also wrote a treatise by the name of "The Goodness of Death".
Arianism.
According to legend,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  immediately and forcefully stopped Arianism in Milan.
He studied theology with Simplician, a presbyter of Rome.
Using his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, to his advantage, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like  <START:person> Philo <END> , Origen,  <START:person> Athanasius <END> , and Basil of Caesarea, with whom he was also exchanging letters.
He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed  <START:person> Augustine of Hippo <END> , who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.
In the confrontation with  <START:person> Arians <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the Nicene creed and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy.
The  <START:person> Arians <END>  appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires.
Although the western Emperor  <START:person> Gratian <END>  supported orthodoxy, the younger  <START:person> Valentinian II <END> , who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  did not sway the young prince's position.
In the East, Emperor  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  I likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy.
In this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops Palladius of Ratiaria and Secundianus of Singidunum, confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire.
This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation.
However,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops.
Accordingly, a synod composed of thirty-two bishops was held at Aquileia in the year 381.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined.
A vote was then taken, when  <START:person> Palladius <END>  and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.
Nevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose.
In 385 or 386 the emperor and his mother  <START:person> Justina <END> , along with a considerable number of clergy and laity, especially military, professed Arianism.
They demanded two churches in Milan, one in the city (the Basilica of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), to the Arians.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.
He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches.
The day following, when he was performing divine service in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs.
As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of Easter.
In spite of Imperial opposition, Bishop  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  declared: If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of  <START:person> Christ <END> .
I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it.
The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but God alone can appease it.
Imperial relations.
The imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> , however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor.
When  <START:person> Magnus Maximus <END>  usurped the supreme power in Gaul, and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.
A second later embassy was unsuccessful.
The enemy entered Italy and Milan was taken.
 <START:person> Justina <END>  and her son fled but  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.
In 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused Valentinian II's imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the use of Arian troops.
In 386  <START:person> Justina <END>  and Valentinian received the  <START:person> Arian <END>  bishop  <START:person> Auxentius <END>  the younger, and  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.
Theodosius I, the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of  <START:person> Justina <END> , and regained the kingdom.
 <START:person> Theodosius <END>  was excommunicated by  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  for the massacre of 7,000 persons at Thessalonica in 390, after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  told  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  to imitate  <START:person> David <END>  in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt —  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also forced Theodosius to retreat from compensating a Jewish community in Mesopotamia when a synagogue was burnt down by militant Christians.
These incidents show the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor — the controversy of  <START:person> John Chrysostom <END>  with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.
In 392, after the death of Valentinian II and the acclamation of  <START:person> Eugenius <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  after  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  was eventually victorious.
Attitude towards Jews.
In his treatise on  <START:person> Abraham <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  warns against intermarriage with pagans, Jews, or heretics.
In 388, Emperor  <START:person> Theodosius the Great <END>  was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the synagogue at Callinicum on the Euphrates.
He ordered the synagogue rebuilt at the expense of the bishop.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  wrote to him, pointing out that he was thereby "exposing the bishop to the danger of either acting against the truth or of death"; in the letter "the reasons given for the imperial rescript are met, especially by the plea that the Jews had burnt many churches".
In the course of the letter  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  speaks of the clemency that the emperor had shown with regard to the burning of other buildings and then adds: "There is, then, no adequate cause for such a commotion, that the people should be so severely punished for the burning of a building, and much less since it is the burning of a synagogue, a home of unbelief, a house of impiety, a receptacle of folly, which God Himself has condemned.
For thus we read, where the Lord our God speaks by the mouth of the prophet  <START:person> Jeremiah <END> : 'And I will do to this house, which is called by My Name, wherein ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh, and I will cast you forth from My sight, as I cast forth your brethren, the whole seed of  <START:person> Ephraim <END> .
And do not thou pray for that people, and do not thou ask mercy for them, and do not come near Me on their behalf, for I will not hear thee.
Or seest thou not what they do in the cities of  <START:person> Judah <END> ?' God forbids intercession to be made for those."
In his exposition of Psalm 1,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  says: "Virtues without faith are leaves, flourishing in appearance, but unproductive.
How many pagans have mercy and sobriety but no fruit, because they do not attain their purpose!
The leaves speedily fall at the wind's breath.
Some Jews exhibit purity of life and much diligence and love of study, but bear no fruit and live like leaves."
Attitude towards pagans.
Under  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's major influence, emperors Gratian, Valentinian II and Theodosius I carried on a persecution of Paganism.
Under  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's influence,  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  issued the 391 "Theodosian decrees," which with increasing intensity outlawed  <START:person> Pagan <END>  practises, and the Altar of Victory was removed by  <START:person> Gratian <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  prevailed upon Gratian, Valentinian and  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  to reject requests to restore the Altar.
Later years and death.
In April 393  <START:person> Arbogast <END> , "magister militum" of the West and his puppet Emperor  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  marched into Italy to consolidate their position in regard to Theodosius I and his son,  <START:person> Honorius <END> , whom  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  had appointed Augustus to govern the western portion of the empire.
 <START:person> Arbogast <END>  and  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  courted  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's support by very obliging letters; but before they arrived at Milan, he had retired to Bologna, where he assisted at the translation of the relics of SS.
 <START:person> Vitalis <END>  and Agricola.
From there he went to Florence, where he remained until  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  withdrew from Milan to meet Theodosius in the Battle of the Frigidus in early September 394.
Soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the Roman empire,  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  died at Milan in 395, and two years later (April 4, 397)  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also died.
He was succeeded as bishop of Milan by  <START:person> Simplician <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's body may still be viewed in the church of S. Ambrogio in Milan, where it has been continuously venerated — along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of Sts.
 <START:person> Gervase <END>  and Protase.
Character.
Many circumstances in the history of  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  are characteristic of the general spirit of the times.
The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period.
But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.
He was generous to the poor; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship.
It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two martyrs,  <START:person> Gervasius <END>  and Protasius.
The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died.
The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.
Theology.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  ranks with  <START:person> Augustine <END> ,  <START:person> Jerome <END> , and  <START:person> Gregory the Great <END> , as one of the Latin Doctors of the Church.
Theologians compare him with  <START:person> Hilary <END> , who they claim fell short of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's administrative excellence but demonstrated greater theological ability.
He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of Biblical and doctrinal subjects.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing doctrine of the Church and its sacerdotal ministry, while the prevalent asceticism of the day, continuing the Stoic and Ciceronian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian ethics.
Thus we have the "De officiis ministrorum", "De viduis", "De virginitate" and "De paenitentia".
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place.
His advice to  <START:person> Augustine <END>  of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom.
"When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not.
Follow the custom of the church where you are."
Thus  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the "right" liturgical form where there was no substantial problem.
His advice has remained in the English language as the saying, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
One interpretation of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's writings is that he was a Christian universalist.
It has been noted that  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's theology was significantly influenced by that of Origen and  <START:person> Didymus the Blind <END> , two other early Christian universalists.
One quotation cited in favor of this belief: Our Savior has appointed two kinds of resurrection in the Apocalypse.
'Blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection,' for such come to grace without the judgment.
As for those who do not come to the first, but are reserved unto the second resurrection, these shall be disciplined until their appointed times, between the first and the second resurrection.
One could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream Christian belief in a general resurrection (both for those in heaven and for those in hell).
Several other works by  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation.
For example: The Jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into God, "and therefore have lost the grace of redemption", because they reject that on which salvation depends.
Giving to the poor.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders, but a part of the united, solidary people.
Giving to the poor was not to be considered an act of generosity towards the fringes of society but as a repayment of resources that God had originally bestowed on everyone equally and that the rich had usurped.
Mariology.
The theological treatises of Ambrose of Milan would come to influence  <START:person> Popes Damasus <END> ,  <START:person> Siricius <END>  and  <START:person> Leo XIII <END> .
Central to  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is the virginity of  <START:person> Mary <END>  and her role as  <START:person> Mother of God <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  viewed virginity as superior to marriage and saw  <START:person> Mary <END>  as the model of virginity.
Writings.
In matters of exegesis he is, like  <START:person> Hilary <END> , an Alexandrian.
In dogma he follows Basil of Caesarea and other Greek authors, but nevertheless gives a distinctly Western cast to the speculations of which he treats.
This is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human sin and divine grace, and in the place which he assigns to faith in the individual Christian life.
Church music.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of Ambrosian chant also known simply as "antiphonal chant", a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other.
(The later pope St.  <START:person> Gregory <END>  I the Great is not known to have composed any Gregorian chant, the plainsong or "Romish chant".)
However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing hymnody from the Eastern Church into the West.
Catching the impulse from  <START:person> Hilary <END>  and confirmed in it by the success of Arian psalmody,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  composed several original hymns as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies.
Each of these hymns has eight four-line stanzas and is written in strict iambic dimeter (that is 2 x 2 iambs).
Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.
In his writings,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refers only to the performance of psalms, in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an "antiphon".
 <START:person> St. Ambrose <END>  was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn "Te Deum", which he is said to have composed when he baptised St. Augustine of Hippo, his celebrated convert.
Augustine.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was Bishop of Milan at the time of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's conversion, and is mentioned in  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions".
Celibacy.
In a passage of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions" in which  <START:person> Augustine <END>  wonders why he could not share his burden with  <START:person> Ambrose <END> , he makes a comment which bears on the history of celibacy:  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor.
Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden.
Reading.
In this same passage of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions" is a curious anecdote which bears on the history of reading: When [ <START:person> Ambrose <END> ] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still.
Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud.
This is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion.
The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become.
In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection.
However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual.
In popular culture.
In the 2012 film "", Bishop  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is portrayed by Italian actor  <START:person> Andrea Giordana <END> .
Bibliography.
Latin English translations Several of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's works have recently been published in the bilingual Latin-German Fontes Christiani series (currently edited by Brepols).
Several religious brotherhoods which have sprung up in and around Milan at various times since the 14th century have been called Ambrosians.
Their connection to  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is tenuous  Adiabatic process  An adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or matter between a system and its surroundings.
The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics, and as such it is a key concept in thermodynamics.
Some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the "adiabatic approximation," meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system.
In way of example, the adiabatic flame temperature is an idealization that uses the "adiabatic approximation" so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel.
The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by a flame if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings.
Description.
A process that does not involve the transfer of heat or matter into or out of a system, so that "Q" = 0, is called an adiabatic process, and such a system is said to be adiabatically isolated.
The assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption.
For example, the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process, little of the system's energy can be transferred out as heat.
Even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive, that process is idealized to be adiabatic.
The assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one, and is often combined with others so as to make the calculation of the system's behaviour possible.
Such assumptions are idealizations.
The behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations, but the assumption of such "perfect" behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works.
Various applications of the adiabatic assumption.
Naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).
The transfer of energy as work into an adiabatic (insulated) system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds.
One kind of work is where there is no entropy produced within the system (no friction, viscous dissipation, etc), and the work is only pressure-volume work (denoted by "P" d"V").
In nature, this ideal kind occurs only approximately, because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation.
The other extreme kind of work is isochoric work (), for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system.
A stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid, but that work is not recoverable.
Isochoric work is irreversible.
The second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process of transfer of energy as work, always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work.
Every natural process, adiabatic or not, is irreversible, with Δ"S" > 0, as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent.
Adiabatic heating and cooling.
The adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas.
Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature.
In contrast, free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas.
Adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a piston compressing a gas contained within an adiabatic cylinder.
This finds practical application in Diesel engines which rely on the lack of quick heat dissipation during their compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.
Adiabatic heating occurs in the Earth's atmosphere when an air mass descends, for example, in a katabatic wind, Foehn wind, or chinook wind flowing downhill over a mountain range.
When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases.
Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing the internal energy.
The parcel of air is unable to dissipate energy as heat, hence it is considered adiabatically isolated, and its temperature will rise sensibly.
Adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings.
When the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as internal energy decreases.
Adiabatic cooling occurs in the Earth's atmosphere with orographic lifting and lee waves, and this can form pileus or lenticular clouds.
Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid.
One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is adiabatic demagnetisation, where the change in magnetic field on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling.
Also, the contents of an expanding universe can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid.
"(See Heat death of the universe)" Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as kimberlites.
Such temperature changes can be quantified using the ideal gas law, or the hydrostatic equation for atmospheric processes.
In practice, no process is truly adiabatic.
Many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary, and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption.
There is always some heat loss, as no perfect insulators exist.
Ideal gas (reversible process).
The mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process is where "P" is pressure, "V" is volume, and formula_3 being the specific heat for constant pressure, formula_4 being the specific heat for constant volume, formula_5 is the adiabatic index, and formula_6 is the number of degrees of freedom (3 for monatomic gas, 5 for diatomic gas and collinear molecules e.g.
carbon dioxide).
For a monatomic ideal gas, formula_7, and for a diatomic gas (such as nitrogen and oxygen, the main components of air) formula_8.
Note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not Bose– <START:person> Einstein <END>  or Fermi gases.
For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that where "T" is an absolute temperature.
This can also be written as Example of adiabatic compression.
Let's now look at a common example of adiabatic compression–the compression stroke in a gasoline engine.
We will make a few simplifying assumptions: that the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is 1000 cm3 (one litre), that the gas within is nearly pure nitrogen (thus a diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so formula_12 = 7/5), and that the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1000 cm3 volume of uncompressed gas will compress down to 100 cm3 when the piston goes from bottom to top).
The uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27 ºC or 300 K, and a pressure of 1 bar ~ 100 kPa, or about 14.7 PSI, i.e. typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).
formula_13 so our adiabatic constant for this experiment is about 1.58 billion.
The gas is now compressed to a 100 cm3 volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas).
The new volume is 100 cm3, but the constant for this experiment is still 1.58 billion: formula_14 so solving for P: formula_15 or about 362 PSI or 24.5 atm.
Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas has also heated the gas and the hotter gas will have a greater pressure even if the volume had not changed.
We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law.
Our initial conditions are 100,000 pa of pressure, 1000 cm3 volume, and 300 K of temperature, so our experimental constant is: formula_16 That is a final temperature of 751 K, or 477 °C, or 892 °F, well above the ignition point of many fuels.
This is why a high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause engine knocking when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a supercharger and intercooler to provide a lower temperature at the same pressure would be advantageous.
A diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature which ensures immediate ignition of injected fuel.
Adiabatic free expansion of a gas.
For an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum.
Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero.
Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero.
For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case.
Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.
Derivation of P-V relation for adiabatic heating and cooling.
The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, formula_17.
Then, according to the first law of thermodynamics, where "dU" is the change in the internal energy of the system and "δW" is work done "by" the system.
Any work ("δW") done must be done at the expense of internal energy "U", since no heat "δQ" is being supplied from the surroundings.
Pressure-volume work "δW" done "by" the system is defined as However, "P" does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with "V".
It is desired to know how the values of "dP" and "dV" relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds.
For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by where formula_21 is the number of degrees of freedom divided by two, "R" is the universal gas constant and "n" is the number of moles in the system (a constant).
Differentiating Equation (3) and use of the ideal gas law, formula_22, yields Equation (4) is often expressed as formula_24 because formula_25.
Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain factorize :formula_27: and divide both sides by "PV": After integrating the left and right sides from formula_30 to V and from formula_31 to P and changing the sides respectively, Exponentiate both sides, and substitute formula_33 with formula_34, the heat capacity ratio and eliminate the negative sign to obtain Therefore, and Derivation of T-V relation for adiabatic heating and cooling.
Substituting the ideal gas law into the above, we obtain which simplifies to Derivation of discrete formula.
The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to At the same time, the work done by the pressure-volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true By the previous derivation, Rearranging (4) gives Substituting this into (2) gives Integrating, Substituting formula_48, Rearranging, Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases), By the continuous formula, Or, Substituting into the previous expression for formula_54, Substituting this expression and (1) in (3) gives Simplifying, Simplifying, Simplifying, Graphing adiabats.
An adiabat is a curve of constant entropy on the P-V diagram.
Some properties of adiabats on a P-V diagram are indicated.
These properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases, except in the region where "PV" becomes small (low temperature), where quantum effects become important.
The following diagram is a P-V diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms: The isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.
The adiabats are isentropic.
Volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis.
Etymology.
The term "adiabatic", literally means 'not to be passed through'.
It is formed from the ancient Greek privative "α" ("not") + "διαβατός", "able to be passed through", in turn deriving from "διὰ-" ("through"), and "βαῖνειν" ("to walk, go, come"), thus "ἀδιάβατος ".
According to  <START:person> Maxwell <END> , and to  <START:person> Partington <END> , the term was introduced by  <START:person> Rankine <END> .
The etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of transfer of energy as heat and of transfer of matter across the wall.
Divergent usages of the word adiabatic.
This present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics, and the word adiabatic is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics, introduced by  <START:person> Rankine <END> .
It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated.
In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be adiabatic (though often far from isentropic) even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated.
Quantum mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics, however, use the word adiabatic in very a different sense, one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense.
In quantum theory, the word adiabatic can mean something perhaps near isentropic, or perhaps near quasi-static, but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines.
On one hand in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly (that is to say quasi-statically), it is said to have been done adiabatically.
The idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously, so that no quantum jump is triggered, and the change is virtually reversible.
While the occupation numbers are unchanged, nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one-to-one corresponding, pre-and post-compression, eigenstates.
Thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system.
For example,  <START:person> Max Born <END>  writes "Actually, it is usually the 'adiabatic' case with which we have to do: i.e. the limiting case where the external force (or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other) acts very slowly.
In this case, to a very high approximation that is, there is no probability for a transition, and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation.
Such a slow perturbation is therefore reversible, as it is classically."
On the other hand in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly, it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates, as well as changing their shapes.
In that theory, such a rapid change is said not to be 'adiabatic', and the contrary word 'diabatic' is even applied to it.
One might guess that perhaps  <START:person> Clausius <END> , if he were confronted with this, in the now-obsolete language he used in his day, would have said that "internal work" was done and that 'heat was generated though not transferred'.
In classical thermodynamics, such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated, and there is no transfer of energy as heat.
The strong irreversibility of the change, due to viscosity or other entropy production, does not impinge on this classical usage.
Thus for a mass of gas, in macroscopic thermodynamics, words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer, even if the system is not adiabatically isolated.
But in quantum statistical theory, a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid, even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term.
The words are used differently in the two disciplines, as stated just above.
Abbotsford House  Abbotsford is a historic country house in the Scottish Borders, at the town of Galashiels, near Melrose, on the south bank of the River Tweed.
It was formerly the residence of historical novelist and poet,  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  (Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END> ,Bt).
It is a Category A Listed Building.
Description.
The nucleus of the estate was a small farm of 100 acre, called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i.e., muddy) Hole, and was bought by  <START:person> Scott <END>  on the lapse of his lease (1811) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel.
He first built a small villa and named it Abbotsford, creating the name from a ford nearby where previously abbots of Melrose Abbey used to cross the river.
 <START:person> Scott <END>  then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion, building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of Scotland.
In it he gathered a large library, a collection of ancient furniture, arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities, especially connected with Scottish history, notably the Celtic Torrs Pony-cap and Horns and the Woodwrae Stone, all now in the Museum of Scotland.
The last and principal acquisition was that of  <START:person> Toftfield <END>  (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in 1817.
The new house was then begun and completed in 1824.
The general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed; and the style is mainly the Scottish Baronial.
Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the old Tolbooth in Edinburgh.
 <START:person> Scott <END>  had only enjoyed his residence one year when (1825) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt.
In 1830 the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors.
The property was wholly disencumbered in 1847 by  <START:person> Robert Cadell <END> , the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family's share in the copyright of Sir  <START:person> Walter <END> 's works.
 <START:person> Scott <END> 's only son  <START:person> Walter <END>  did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from India in 1847.
Among subsequent possessors were  <START:person> Scott <END> 's son-in-law,  <START:person> John Gibson Lockhart <END> ,  <START:person> J. R. Hope Scott <END> , QC, and his daughter ( <START:person> Scott <END> 's great-granddaughter), the Hon.
Mrs  <START:person> Maxwell Scott <END> .
The house was opened to the public in 1833, but continued to be occupied by  <START:person> Scott <END> 's descendants until 2004.
The last of his direct descendants to inhabit Abbotsford was his great-great-great-granddaughter  <START:person> Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott <END>  (8 June 1923 5 May 2004).
She inherited it from her elder sister  <START:person> Patricia <END>  in 1998.
The sisters turned the house into one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house.
It had electricity installed only in 1962.
 <START:person> Dame Jean <END>  was at one time a lady-in-waiting to Princess  <START:person> Alice <END> , Duchess of Gloucester, patron of the Dandie Dinmont Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END> 's characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir  <START:person> Wattie <END> , ridden by  <START:person> Ian Stark <END> , won two silver medals at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Scottish Borders Council is considering an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the River Tweed from Abbotsford, to which Historic Scotland and the National Trust for Scotland object.
Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  rescued the "jougs" from Threave Castle in Dumfries and  <START:person> Galloway <END>  and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at Abbotsford.
Tweedbank railway station is located near to Abbotsford House.
Miscellaneous.
Abbotsford gave its name to the Abbotsford Club, founded by  <START:person> William Barclay Turnbull <END>  in 1833 or 1834 in  <START:person> Scott <END> 's honour, and a successor to the  <START:person> Bannatyne <END>  and Maitland Clubs.
It was a text publication society, which existed to print and publish historical works connected with  <START:person> Scott <END> 's writings.
Its publications extended from 1835 to 1864.
In keeping with its many  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  references, Rose Street in Edinburgh has a bar called the "Kenilworth", along with one named the "Abbotsford".
In 2012, a new Visitors Centre opened at Abbotsford which houses a small exhibition, Ochiltrees Diner and a gift shop In 2014 it won the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award for its recent conservation project.
 <START:person> Alan Kay  Alan Curtis Kay <END>  (born May 17, 1940) is an American computer scientist.
He has been elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society of Arts.
He is best known for his pioneering work on object-oriented programming and windowing graphical user interface design.
He is the president of the Viewpoints Research Institute, and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.
He is also on the advisory board of TTI/Vanguard.
Until mid-2005, he was a Senior Fellow at HP Labs, a Visiting Professor at Kyoto University, and an Adjunct Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
After 10 years at Xerox PARC,  <START:person> Kay <END>  became Atari's chief scientist for three years.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is also a former professional jazz guitarist, composer, and theatrical designer, and an amateur classical pipe organist.
Early life and work.
In an interview on education in America with the Davis Group Ltd.  <START:person> Alan Kay <END>  said, "I had the fortune or misfortune to learn how to read fluently starting at the age of three.
So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade.
And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me." Originally from Springfield, Massachusetts,  <START:person> Kay <END>  attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, earning a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Molecular Biology.
Before and during this time, he worked as a professional jazz guitarist.
In 1966, he began graduate school at the University of Utah College of Engineering, earning a Master's degree and a Ph.D. degree.
There, he worked with  <START:person> Ivan Sutherland <END> , who had done pioneering graphics programs including Sketchpad.
This greatly inspired  <START:person> Kay <END> 's evolving views on objects and programming.
As he grew busier with ARPA research, he quit his career as a professional musician.
In 1968, he met  <START:person> Seymour Papert <END>  and learned of the Logo programming language, a dialect of Lisp optimized for educational use.
This led him to learn of the work of  <START:person> Jean Piaget <END> ,  <START:person> Jerome Bruner <END> ,  <START:person> Lev Vygotsky <END> , and of constructionist learning.
These further influenced his views.
In 1970,  <START:person> Kay <END>  joined Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, PARC.
In the 1970s he was one of the key members there to develop prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language Smalltalk.
These inventions were later commercialized by Apple Computer in their  <START:person> Lisa <END>  and Macintosh computers.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is one of the fathers of the idea of object-oriented programming, which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC and predecessors at the Norwegian Computing Center.
He conceived the Dynabook concept which defined the conceptual basics for laptop and tablet computers and E-books, and is the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface (GUI).
Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform,  <START:person> Kay <END>  is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning, and indeed, many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the One Laptop Per Child educational platform, with which  <START:person> Kay <END>  is actively involved.
The field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen, according to  <START:person> Kay <END> , in which educational communities, parents, and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by  <START:person> Douglas Engelbart <END> , but a medium in  <START:person> Marshall McLuhan <END>  sense.
He wrote that the destiny of personal computing is not going to be: (...) a 'vehicle', as in Engelbart's metaphor opposed to the IBM 'railroads', but something much more profound: a (...) medium.
With a 'vehicle' one could wait until high school and give 'drivers ed', but if it was a medium, it had to extend into the world of childhood.
Recent work and recognition.
Starting in 1984,  <START:person> Kay <END>  was an Apple Fellow at Apple Computer until the closing of the ATG (Advanced Technology Group), one of the company's R&D divisions.
He then joined  <START:person> Walt Disney Imagineering <END>  as a Disney Fellow and remained there until Disney ended its Disney Fellow program.
After Disney, in 2001 he founded Viewpoints Research Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development.
Later,  <START:person> Kay <END>  worked with a team at Applied Minds, then became a Senior Fellow at Hewlett-Packard until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005.
He is currently head of Viewpoints Institute.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  taught a Fall 2011 class, "Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World", at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) along with full-time ITP faculty member  <START:person> Nancy Hechinger <END> .
The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching/learning based on fundamental, powerful concepts—rather than on traditional rote learning.
Squeak, Etoys, and Croquet.
In December 1995, when he was still at Apple,  <START:person> Kay <END>  collaborated with many others to start the open source Squeak version of Smalltalk, and he continues to work on it.
As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the Etoys system.
More recently he started, along with  <START:person> David A. Smith <END> ,  <START:person> David P. Reed <END> ,  <START:person> Andreas Raab <END> ,  <START:person> Rick McGeer <END> ,  <START:person> Julian Lombardi <END> , and  <START:person> Mark McCahill <END> , the Croquet Project, which is an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.
Tweak.
In 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do.
 <START:person> Andreas Raab <END>  was a researcher working in  <START:person> Kay <END> 's group, then at Hewlett-Packard.
He proposed defining a "script process" and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems.
The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future.
Tweak added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.
Its underlying object system is class-based, but to users (during programming) it acts like it is prototype-based.
Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.
Children's Machine.
In November 2005, at the World Summit on the Information Society, the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world.
It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the One Laptop per Child program, the Children's Machine, and the XO-1.
The program was begun and is sustained by  <START:person> Kay <END> 's friend,  <START:person> Nicholas Negroponte <END> , and is based on  <START:person> Kay <END> 's Dynabook ideal.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.
Reinventing programming.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented.
Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled "The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" were informed by his experiences with Sketchpad, Simula, Smalltalk, and the bloated code of commercial software.
On August 31, 2006,  <START:person> Kay <END> 's proposal to the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) was granted, thus funding Viewpoints Research Institute for several years.
The proposal title was: "STEPS Toward the Reinvention of Programming": A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium.
A sense of what  <START:person> Kay <END>  is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: "The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days.
We wonder: how small could be an understandable practical "Model T" design that covers this functionality?
1M lines of code?
200K LOC? 100K LOC? 20K LOC?" Awards and honors.
 <START:person> Alan Kay <END>  has received many awards and honors.
Among them: Other honors: J-D Warnier Prix d’Informatique, ACM Systems Software Award, NEC Computers & Communication Foundation Prize, Funai Foundation Prize,  <START:person> Lewis Branscomb <END>  Technology Award, ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education.
Assault  In common law, assault is the act of creating apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact with a person.
An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm.
It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability.
Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law.
There is, however, an additional criminal law category of assault consisting of an attempted but unsuccessful battery.
The term is often confused with battery, which involves physical contact.
The specific meaning of assault varies between countries, but can refer to an act that causes another to apprehend immediate and personal violence, or in the more limited sense of a threat of violence caused by an immediate show of force.
Assault in many US jurisdictions and Scotland is defined more broadly still as any intentional physical contact with another person without their consent; but in England and Wales and in most other common law jurisdictions in the world, this is defined instead as battery.
Some jurisdictions have incorporated the definition of civil assault into the definition of the crime making it a criminal assault intentionally to cause another person to apprehend a harmful or offensive contact.
Related definitions.
Battery.
In common law, criminal assault often accompanies battery.
See common assault.
The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.
Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting him is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.
Aggravated assault.
Aggravated assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a deadly weapon.
A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to: Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.
Defenses.
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault: Consent.
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as de minimis harm.
Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.
Consent may be a complete or partial defense to assault.
In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.
This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual sadomasochistic sexual activity, the most notable case being the Operation Spanner case.
Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game (Mixed martial arts, wrestling, boxing, or contact sports), bodily adornment (R v Wilson), or horseplay ( <START:person> Jones <END>  and others).
However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent.
In Scottish Law, consent is not a defense for assault.
Arrest and other official acts.
Police officers and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an arrest or generally carrying out their official duties.
Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.
Punishment.
In some jurisdictions such as Singapore, judicial corporal punishment is part of the legal system.
The officers who administer the punishment have immunity from prosecution for assault.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable.
What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and case law.
Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for child abuse.
Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of less severe corporal punishment for children in school.
In English law, s58 Children Act 2004, limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s39 Criminal Justice Act 1988.
Prevention of crime.
This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.
Defense of property.
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in defense of property, to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 Criminal Damage Act 1971 it may be argued that the defendant has a "lawful excuse" to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 Criminal Law Act 1967) subject to the need to deter vigilantes and excessive self-help.
Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder.
The resident merely needs to assert to the court that he felt threatened by the intruder's presence.
This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.
Regional details.
Canada.
Assault is an offence under s.
265 of the Criminal Code of Canada.
Similar to the United States, there is a wide range of the type of Assault that can occur.
Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent.
It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person.
An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force.
It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.
He attempts or threatens, by an act or a gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes that other person to believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his purpose; or threats or fear of the application of force due to gestures to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed.
The Criminal Code of Canada describes Assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence).
Police Officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an Assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.
This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.
Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include: An individual cannot consent to an Assault with Weapon, Assault Causing Bodily Harm, Aggravated Assault, or any Sexual Assault.
Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon).
You cannot consent to serious bodily harm.
India.
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16, sections 351 through 358.
Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.
— s.351 of the Indian Penal Code The Code further explains that "mere words do not amount to an assault.
But the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault."
Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350).
The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.
Nigeria.
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.
Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act.
Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.
Pacific Islands.
Marshall Islands The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.
A person is guilty of this offence if he unlawfully offers or attempts, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.
Republic of Ireland.
Section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of assault causing harm.
South Africa.
South African law does not draw the distinction between assault and battery.
"Assault" is a common law crime defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him."
The law also recognises the crime of "assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm", where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health."
The common law crime of "indecent assault" was repealed by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007, and replaced by a statutory crime of "sexual assault".
United Kingdom.
Abolished offence: England and Wales.
English law provides for two offences of assault: common assault and battery.
Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence.
"Violence" in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile.
Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of battery, even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.
A common assault is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty.
Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the magistrates' court in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the Crown Court).
Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.
Scotland.
In Scots Law, assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another".
There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a "physical" attack on another's person, as demonstrated in " <START:person> Atkinson <END>  v. HM Advocate" wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a ski mask.
The court said: [A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm— <START:person> Atkinson <END>  v. HM Advocate (1987) Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or "Hamesuken" (to assault a person in his own home).
The "mens rea" for assault is simply "evil intent", although this has been held to mean no more than that assault "cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently" as upheld in "Lord Advocate's Reference No 2 of 1992" where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.
It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of his duty, under section 41 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
Northern Ireland.
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland.
The Offences against the Person Act 1861 creates the offences of: The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 creates the offences of: That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'.
under secction 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
United States.
American common law has defined assault as an attempt to commit a battery.
Assault is typically treated as a misdemeanor and not as a felony (unless it involves a law enforcement officer).
The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.
Four elements were required at common law: Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person.
The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault.
In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.
As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice.
These four elements were eventually codified in most states.
Laws on assault vary by state.
Since each state has its own laws, there is no universal assault law.
Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as battery, menacing, intimidation, reckless endangerment etc. in another state.
Modern American statutes may define assault as including: The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as exemplified below.
In Tennessee assault is defined as follows: 39-13-101.
Assault.
In Kansas the law on assault states: North Dakota law states: Simple assault.
States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double inchoate offense.
In some states, consent is a complete defense to assault.
In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a "petty misdemeanor".
In New York State assault as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120, requires an actual injury.
Other states define this as battery.
There is no crime of battery in New York.
The threat of imminent injury without physical contact in New York is called Menacing.
New York also has specific laws against Hazing when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.
Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human.
Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man.
However, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 treats the fetus as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances.
See  Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are: Ancient Greece.
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed hubris.
Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening pride, self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution.
In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well.
It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.
Violations of the law against hubris included what would today be termed assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.
Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of  <START:person> Demosthenes <END> , a prominent statesman and orator in ancient Greece.
These two examples occurred when first,  <START:person> Meidias <END>  punched  <START:person> Demosthenes <END>  in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against  <START:person> Konon <END> ) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.
Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens.
It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world.
That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved.
The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.
The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws.
Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic.
Atë, Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of his/her hubris, or great pride, that leads to his/her death or downfall.
Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame.
The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris.
This concept of honor is akin to a zero-sum game.
Rush  <START:person> Rehm <END>  simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

Abner  In the Book of  <START:person> Samuel <END> ,  <START:person> Abner <END>  (Hebrew אבנר "Avner" meaning "father of [or is a] light"), is cousin to  <START:person> Saul <END>  and commander-in-chief of his army (1  <START:person> Samuel <END>  14:50, 20:25).
He is often referred to as the son of Ner.
Biography.
 <START:person> Abner <END>  is only referred to incidentally in  <START:person> Saul <END> 's history (1  <START:person> Samuel <END>  17:55, 26:5), first appearing as the commander who introduced  <START:person> David <END>  to  <START:person> Saul <END>  following  <START:person> David <END> 's killing of Goliath.
He is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous battle of Gilboa when  <START:person> Saul <END> 's power was crushed.
Seizing the youngest but only surviving of  <START:person> Saul <END> 's sons, Ish-bosheth,  <START:person> Abner <END>  set him up as king over Israel at Mahanaim, east of the Jordan.
 <START:person> David <END> , who was accepted as king by  <START:person> Judah <END>  alone, was meanwhile reigning at Hebron, and for some time war was carried on between the two parties.
The only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy, inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at Gibeon between twelve chosen men from each side, in which the whole twenty-four seem to have perished (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  2:12).
In the general engagement which followed,  <START:person> Abner <END>  was defeated and put to flight.
He was closely pursued by  <START:person> Asahel <END> , brother of  <START:person> Joab <END> , who is said to have been "light of foot as a wild roe" (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  2:18).
As  <START:person> Asahel <END>  would not desist from the pursuit, though warned,  <START:person> Abner <END>  was compelled to slay him in self-defence.
This originated a deadly feud between the leaders of the opposite parties, for  <START:person> Joab <END> , as next of kin to  <START:person> Asahel <END> , was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood.
However, according to  <START:person> Josephus <END> , in Antiquities, Book 7, Chapter 1,  <START:person> Joab <END>  had forgiven  <START:person> Abner <END>  for the death of his brother,  <START:person> Asahel <END> , the reason being that  <START:person> Abner <END>  had slain  <START:person> Asahel <END>  honorably in combat after he had first warned  <START:person> Asahel <END>  and had no other choice but to kill him out of self-defense.
This battle was part of a civil war between  <START:person> David <END>  and Ish-bosheth, the son of  <START:person> Saul <END> .
After this battle  <START:person> Abner <END>  switched to the side of  <START:person> David <END>  and granted him control over the tribe of  <START:person> Benjamin <END> .
This act put  <START:person> Abner <END>  in  <START:person> David <END> 's favor.
The real reason that  <START:person> Joab <END>  killed  <START:person> Abner <END>  was that he became a threat to his rank of general.
He then justifies it later by mentioning his brother.
For some time afterward the war was carried on, the advantage being invariably on the side of  <START:person> David <END> .
At length, Ish-bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing  <START:person> Abner <END>  of sleeping with  <START:person> Rizpah <END>  (cf. 2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3:7), one of  <START:person> Saul <END> 's concubines, an alliance which, according to contemporary notions, would imply pretensions to the throne (cf. 2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  16:21ff.).
 <START:person> Abner <END>  was indignant at the rebuke, and immediately opened negotiations with  <START:person> David <END> , who welcomed him on the condition that his wife  <START:person> Michal <END>  should be restored to him.
This was done, and the proceedings were ratified by a feast.
Almost immediately after, however,  <START:person> Joab <END> , who had been sent away, perhaps intentionally returned and slew  <START:person> Abner <END>  at the gate of Hebron.
The ostensible motive for the assassination was a desire to avenge  <START:person> Asahel <END> , and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time.
The conduct of  <START:person> David <END>  after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act, though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3:31-39; cf. 1 Kings 2:31ff.).
 <START:person> David <END>  had  <START:person> Abner <END>  buried in Hebron (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3.31-39).
His tomb, according to a medieval Jewish tradition, is considered to be in a building not far from the Cave of the Patriarchs.
Soon after  <START:person> Abner <END> 's death, Ish-bosheth was assassinated as he slept (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  4), and  <START:person> David <END>  became king of the reunited kingdoms (2 Samuel 5).
 <START:person> Ahmed III  Ahmed III <END>  (Ottoman Turkish: احمد ثالث "Aḥmed-i sālis") (December 30/31, 1673 – July 1, 1736) was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a son of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–87).
His mother was  <START:person> Mâh-Pâre Ummatullah <END>  (Emetullah) Râbi'a Gül-Nûş Valide Sultan, originally named  <START:person> Evmania Voria <END> , who was an ethnic Greek.
He was born at Hajioglupazari, in Dobruja.
He succeeded to the throne in 1703 on the abdication of his brother  <START:person> Mustafa II <END>  (1695–1703).
 <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha <END>  and his daughter,  <START:person> Hatice Sultan <END>  (wife of the former) directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the "Tulip Era".
Biography.
 <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of Russia's menacing attitude; in fact, both his wives were Frenchwomen.
He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to  <START:person> Charles XII <END>  of Sweden (1682–1718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of  <START:person> Peter <END>  I of Russia (1672–1725) in the Battle of Poltava of 1709.
In 1710  <START:person> Charles XII <END>  convinced Sultan  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under  <START:person> Baltacı Mehmet Pasha <END>  won a major victory at the Battle of Prut.
In the aftermath, Russia returned Azov back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of Taganrog and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Forced against his will into war with Russia,  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  came nearer than any Ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his grand vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha <END>  succeeded in completely surrounding at the Pruth River Campaign in 1711.
The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished.
However, this was halted as a report reached Constantinople that the Safavids were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia.
Sultan  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen Janissaries, led by the Albanian  <START:person> Patrona Halil <END> , was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.
 <START:person> Ahmed <END>  voluntarily led his nephew  <START:person> Mahmud <END>  I (1730–54) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire.
He then retired to the Kafes previously occupied by  <START:person> Mahmud <END>  and died at Topkapı Palace after six years of confinement.
Character of  <START:person> Ahmed III <END> 's rule.
The reign of  <START:person> Ahmed III <END> , which had lasted for twenty-seven years, although marked by the disasters of the Great Turkish War, was not unsuccessful.
The recovery of  <START:person> Azov <END>  and the  <START:person> Morea <END> , and the conquest of part of Persia, managed to counterbalance the Balkan territory ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy through the Treaty of Passarowitz, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18.
In 1716, he sent an army of 33,000 men to capture Corfu from the Republic of Venice.
 <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  left the finances of the Ottoman Empire in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures.
He was a cultivated patron of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first printing press authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Constantinople, operated by  <START:person> Ibrahim Muteferrika <END>  (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).
It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the Danubian Principalities was introduced: previously, the Porte had appointed Hospodars, usually native Moldavian and Wallachian boyars, to administer those provinces; after the Russian campaign of 1711, during which Peter the Great found an ally in Moldavia Prince  <START:person> Dimitrie Cantemir <END> , the Porte began overtly deputizing Phanariote Greeks in that region, and extended the system to Wallachia after Prince  <START:person> Stefan Cantacuzino <END>  established links with  <START:person> Eugene of Savoy <END> .
The Phanariotes constituted a kind of "Dhimmi" nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.
Relations with the Mughal Empire.
 <START:person> Jahandar Shah <END> .
In the year 1712, the Mughal Emperor  <START:person> Jahandar Shah <END> , a grandson of  <START:person> Aurangzeb <END>  sent gifts to the Ottoman Sultan  <START:person> Ahmad III <END>  and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer.
Farrukhsiyar.
The Mughal Emperor  <START:person> Farrukhsiyar <END>  a grandson of  <START:person> Aurangzeb <END> , is also known to have sent a letter to the Ottomans but this time it was received by the Grand Vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha <END>  providing a graphic description of the efforts of the Mughal commander  <START:person> Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha <END>  against the Rajput and Maratha rebellion.
Marriages and issue.
He married  <START:person> Aminā <END>  ( <START:person> Emine <END> ) Mihr-î-Mâh Sultan and Râbi'a Sermi Sultan.
By the first wife he had  <START:person> Mustafa III <END>  and by the second wife he had  <START:person> Abdul Hamid I. <END> 
One of his daughters was  <START:person> Zeynep Asıme Sultan <END> .
Zeynep Sultan Mosque was built by her order.
 <START:person> Fatma Sultan <END>  was also his daughter and was married to grand vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha <END> , by whom she directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the Tulip Era.
In fiction.
In Voltaire's "Candide", the eponymous main character meets the deposed  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  on a ship from Venice to Constantinople.
The Sultan is in the company of five other deposed European monarchs, and he tells  <START:person> Candide <END> , who initially doubts his credentials: I am not jesting, my name is  <START:person> Achmet III <END> .
For several years I was Sultan; I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me; they cut off the heads of my viziers; I am ending my days in the old seraglio; my nephew,  <START:person> Sultan Mahmoud <END> , sometimes allows me to travel for my health, and I have come to spend the Carnival at Venice."
This episode was taken up by the modern Turkish writer  <START:person> Nedim Gürsel <END>  as the setting of his 2001 novel "Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul".
In fact, there is no evidence of the deposed Sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels, nor did  <START:person> Voltaire <END>  (or Gürsel) assert that it had any actual historical foundation.

Media related to at Wikimedia Commons+  Works written by or about at Wikisource  Agesilaus II  Agesilaus II (; Greek: Ἀγησίλαος "Agesilaos"; c. 444 – c. 360 BC), was a Eurypontid king of the Ancient Greek city-state of Sparta, ruling from approximately 400 BC to 360 BC, during most of which time he was, in Plutarch's words, "as good as thought commander and king of all Greece," and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country's deeds and fortunes.
Small in stature and lame from birth,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  became ruler somewhat unexpectedly in his mid-forties.
His reign saw successful military incursions into various states in Asia Minor, as well as successes in the Corinthian War; although several diplomatic decisions resulted in Sparta becoming increasingly isolated prior to his death at the age of 84 in Cyrenaica.
He was greatly admired by his friend, the historian  <START:person> Xenophon <END> , who wrote a minor work about him titled "Agesilaus".
History.
Early life.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was the son of Archidamus II and his second wife,  <START:person> Eupoleia <END> , brother to Cynisca (the first woman in ancient history to achieve an Olympic victory), and younger half-brother of Agis II.
There is little surviving detail on the youth of Agesilaus.
Born with one leg shorter, he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king Agis II, especially because the latter had a son (Leotychidas).
Therefore,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was trained in the traditional curriculum of Sparta, the "agoge."
However,  <START:person> Leotychidas <END>  was ultimately set aside as illegitimate (contemporary rumors representing him as the son of Alcibiades) and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  became king around 401 BC, at the age of about forty.
In addition to questions of his nephew's paternity,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> ' succession was largely due to the intervention of his Spartan general,  <START:person> Lysander <END> , who hoped to find in him a willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs.
 <START:person> Lysander <END>  and the young  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  came to maintain an intimate relation (see Pederasty in Ancient Greece), as was common of the period.
Their unique relationship would serve an important role during  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> ' later campaigns in Asia Minor.
Early reign.
Agesilaus is first recorded as king during the suppression of the conspiracy of Cinadon, shortly after 398 BC.
Then, in 396 BC,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  crossed into Asia with a force of 2,000 neodamodes (freed helots) and 6,000 allies (including 30 Spartiates) to liberate Greek cities from Persian dominion.
On the eve of sailing from Aulis he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as  <START:person> Agamemnon <END>  had done before the Trojan expedition, but the Thebans intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them.
On his arrival at Ephesus a three months' truce was concluded with Tissaphernes, the satrap of  <START:person> Lydia <END>  and Caria, but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  raided Phrygia, where he easily won immense booty from the satrap Pharnabazus;  <START:person> Tissaphernes <END>  could offer no assistance, as he had concentrated his troops in Caria.
In these campaigns  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  also benefited from the aid of the Ten Thousand (a mercenary army), who marched through miles of Persian territory to reach the Black Sea.
After spending the winter organizing a cavalry force ("hippeis"), he made a successful incursion into  <START:person> Lydia <END>  in the spring of 395 BC.
Tithraustes was sent to replace  <START:person> Tissaphernes <END> , who paid with his life for his continued failure.
An armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , who left the southern satrapy and again invaded Phrygia, which he ravaged until the following spring.
He then came to an agreement with Pharnabazus and once more turned southward.
During these campaigns,  <START:person> Lysander <END>  attempted to manipulate  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  into ceding his authority.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , the former passive lover of  <START:person> Lysander <END> , would have nothing of this, and reminded  <START:person> Lysander <END>  (who was only a Spartan general) who was king.
He had  <START:person> Lysander <END>  sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the Aegean.
This dominating move by  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  earned the respect of his men-at-arms and of  <START:person> Lysander <END>  himself, who remained emotionally close with Agesilaus.
In 394 BC, while encamped on the plain of Thebe, he was planning a campaign in the interior, or even an attack on Artaxerxes II himself, when he was recalled to Greece owing to the war between Sparta and the combined forces of Athens, Thebes, Corinth,  <START:person> Argos <END>  and several minor states.
A rapid march through Thrace and Macedonia brought him to Thessaly, where he repulsed the Thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him.
Reinforced by  <START:person> Phocian <END>  and Orchomenian troops and a Spartan army, he met the confederate forces at Coronea in Boeotia and in a hotly contested battle was technically victorious.
However, the Spartan baggage train was ransacked and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  himself was injured during the fighting, resulting in a subsequent retreat by way of Delphi to the Peloponnese.
Shortly before this battle the Spartan navy, of which he had received the supreme command, was totally defeated off Cnidus by a powerful Persian fleet under Conon and Pharnabazus.
During these conflicts in mainland Greece,  <START:person> Lysander <END>  perished while attacking the walls of Thebes.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END> , the second king of Sparta (see Spartan Constitution for more information on Sparta's dual monarchy), was supposed to provide  <START:person> Lysander <END>  with reinforcements as they marched into Boeotia, yet failed to arrive in time to assist  <START:person> Lysander <END> , likely because  <START:person> Pausanias <END>  disliked him for his brash and arrogant attitude towards the Spartan royalty and government.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END>  failed to fight for the bodies of the dead, and because he retrieved the bodies under truce (a sign of defeat), he was disgraced and banished from Sparta.
In 393 BC, Agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of Argolis.
In 392 BC he took a prominent part in the Corinthian War, making several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory and capturing Lechaeum and Piraeus.
The loss, however, of a battalion (mora), destroyed by Iphicrates, neutralized these successes, and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  returned to Sparta.
In 389 BC he conducted a campaign in Acarnania, but two years later the Peace of Antalcidas, warmly supported by  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , put an end to hostilities.
In this interval,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  declined command over Sparta's aggression on Mantineia, and justified  <START:person> Phoebidas <END> ' seizure of the Theban Cadmea so long as the outcome provided glory to Sparta.
Decline.
When war broke out afresh with Thebes,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  twice invaded Boeotia (in 378 BC and 377 BC), although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness.
In the congress of 371 BC an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general  <START:person> Epaminondas <END> , and due to his influence, Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace, and orders given for Cleombrotus to march against Thebes in 371 BC.
 <START:person> Cleombrotus <END>  was defeated at Leuctra and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.
In 370 BC Agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to Mantineia, and reassured the Spartans with an invasion of Arcadia.
He preserved an un-walled Sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of helots, perioeci and even other Spartans; and against external enemies, with four different armies led by  <START:person> Epaminondas <END>  penetrating Laconia that same year.
Again, in 362 BC,  <START:person> Epaminondas <END>  almost succeeded in seizing the city with a rapid and unexpected march.
The Battle of Mantinea, in which  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy.
According to  <START:person> Xenophon <END> ,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , in order to gain money for prosecuting the war, supported the satrap Ariobarzanes II in his revolt against Artaxerxes II in 364 BC (Revolt of the Satraps), and in 361 BC he went to Egypt at the head of a mercenary force to aid the king Nectanebo I and his regent Teos against Persia.
He soon transferred his services to Teos's cousin and rival  <START:person> Nectanebo II <END> , who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 talents.
On his way home  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  died in Cyrenaica, around the age of 84, after a reign of some 41 years.
His body was embalmed in wax, and buried at Sparta.
Legacy.
Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was lame from birth.
These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an oracle having warned Sparta against a "lame reign."
Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in guerrilla warfare, alert and quick, yet cautious—a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time.
Of his courage, temperance, and hardiness, many instances are cited: and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend.
As examples: there is the story of his riding across a stick (horse made of stick) with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children; and because of the affection of his son  <START:person> Archidamus <END> ' for  <START:person> Cleonymus <END> , he saved Sphodrias,  <START:person> Cleonymus <END> ' father, from execution for his incursion into the Piraeus, and dishonorable retreat, in 378 BC.
Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus' reputation and achievements, reckoning him an excellent soldier, but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and siegecraft.
As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign: commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in Asia; and in extreme age, maintaining his prostrate country.
Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the Battle of Leuctra and thus the end of Spartan hegemony.
Other historical accounts paint  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  as a prototype for the ideal leader.
His awareness, thoughtfulness, and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically, while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic Greek commander.
These historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by  <START:person> Lysander <END>  in the former Athenian Empire and the failures of Spartan leaders (such as  <START:person> Pausanias <END>  and Kleombrotos) for the eventually suppression of Spartan power.
The ancient historian  <START:person> Xenophon <END>  was a huge admirer and served under Agesilaus during the campaigns into Asia Minor.
 <START:person> Plutarch <END>  includes among his 78 essays and speeches comprising the apophthegmata Agesilaus' letter to the ephors on his recall: We have reduced most of Asia, driven back the barbarians, made arms abundant in Ionia.
But since you bid me, according to the decree, come home, I shall follow my letter, may perhaps be even before it.
For my command is not mine, but my country's and her allies'.
And a commander then commands truly according to right when he sees his own commander in the laws and ephors, or others holding office in the state.
And when asked whether he wanted a memorial erected in his honor: If I have done any noble action, that is a sufficient memorial; if I have done nothing noble, all the statues in the world will not preserve my memory.
He lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field, and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty, he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth.
He was succeeded by his son  <START:person> Archidamus III <END> .
Selected quotes.
When someone was praising an orator for his ability to magnify small points, he said, "In my opinion it's not a good cobbler who fits large shoes on small feet."
Another time he watched a mouse being pulled from its hole by a small boy.
When the mouse turned around, bit the hand of its captor and escaped, he pointed this out to those present and said, "When the tiniest creature defends itself like this against aggressors, what ought men to do, do you reckon?"
Certainly when somebody asked what gain the laws of  <START:person> Lycurgus <END>  had brought Sparta, he answered, "Contempt for pleasures."
Asked once how far Sparta's boundaries stretched, he brandished his spear and said, "As far as this can reach."
On noticing a house in Asia roofed with square beams, he asked the owner whether timber grew square in that area.
When told no, it grew round, he said, "What then?
If it were square, would you make it round?"
As he was dying on the voyage back from Egypt, he gave instructions to those close to him that they should not be responsible for making any image of his person, be it modeled or painted or copied, "For if I have accomplished any glorious feat, that will be my memorial.
But if I have not, not even all the statues in the world—the products of vulgar, worthless men—would make any difference."
Invited to hear an actor who could perfectly imitate the nightingale,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  declined, saying he had heard the nightingale itself.
 <START:person> Arthur Aikin  Arthur Aikin <END> , FLS, FGS (19 May 1773 – 15 April 1854) was an English chemist, mineralogist and scientific writer.
Life.
He was born at Warrington, Lancashire into a distinguished literary family of prominent Unitarians.
The best known of these was his paternal aunt,  <START:person> Anna Letitia Barbauld <END> , a woman of letters who wrote poetry and essays as well as early children's literature.
His father, Dr  <START:person> John Aikin <END> , was a medical doctor, historian, and author.
His grandfather, also called  <START:person> John Aikin <END>  (1713–1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with Warrington Academy.
His sister  <START:person> Lucy <END>  (1781–1864) was a historical writer.
Their brother  <START:person> Charles <END>  was adopted by their famous aunt and brought up as their cousin.

Publications.
For " <START:person> Rees <END> 's Cyclopædia" he wrote articles about Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy, but the topics are not known.
Ajax (mythology)  Ajax or Aias ( or ; Ancient Greek: Αἴας, gen.
Αἴαντος) was a mythological Greek hero, the son of King Telamon and Periboea, and the half-brother of Teucer.
He plays an important role in Homer's "Iliad" and in the Epic Cycle, a series of epic poems about the Trojan War.
To distinguish him from Ajax, son of Oileus (Ajax the Lesser), he is called "Telamonian Ajax," "Greater Ajax," or "Ajax the Great".
In Etruscan mythology, he is known as Aivas Tlamunus.
Family.
Ajax is the son of Telamon, who was the son of Aeacus and grandson of Zeus, and his first wife  <START:person> Periboea <END> .
He is the cousin of Achilles, and is the elder half-brother of Teucer.
Many illustrious Athenians, including  <START:person> Cimon <END> ,  <START:person> Miltiades <END> ,  <START:person> Alcibiades <END>  and the historian Thucydides, traced their descent from Ajax.
The Italian scholar  <START:person> Maggiani <END>  recently showed that on an Etruscan tomb dedicated to  <START:person> Racvi Satlnei <END>  in Bologna (5th century BC) there is a writing that says: "aivastelmunsl = family of Ajax Télamon".
Description.
In Homer's "Iliad" he is described as of great stature, colossal frame and strongest of all the Achaeans.
Known as the "bulwark of the Achaeans", he was trained by the centaur Chiron (who had trained Ajax' father Telamon and  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' father  <START:person> Peleus <END>  and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by Heracles, whom he was at the time training), at the same time as  <START:person> Achilles <END> .
He was described as vicious, fearless, strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence.
Ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow-hides with a layer of bronze.
Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the "Iliad", and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles, although, in book 13, Poseidon strikes Ajax with his staff, renewing his strength.
Trojan War.
In the "Iliad", Ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage, seen particularly in two fights with  <START:person> Hector <END> .
In Book 7, Ajax is chosen by lot to meet  <START:person> Hector <END>  in a duel which lasts most of a whole day.
Ajax at first gets the better of the encounter, wounding  <START:person> Hector <END>  with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone, but  <START:person> Hector <END>  fights on until the heralds, acting at the direction of Zeus, call a draw: the action ends without a winner and with the two combatants exchanging gifts, Ajax giving  <START:person> Hector <END>  a purple sash and  <START:person> Hector <END>  giving Ajax his sharp sword.
The second fight between Ajax and  <START:person> Hector <END>  occurs when the latter breaks into the Mycenaean camp, and fights with the Greeks among the ships.
In Book 14, Ajax throws a giant rock at Hector which almost kills him.
In Book 15,  <START:person> Hector <END>  is restored to his strength by Apollo and returns to attack the ships.
Ajax, wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship, holds off the Trojan armies virtually single-handedly.
In Book 16,  <START:person> Hector <END>  and Ajax duel once again.
 <START:person> Hector <END>  is set on burning the ships, the only way he feels the Greeks will truly be defeated.
 <START:person> Hector <END>  is able to disarm Ajax (although Ajax is not hurt) and Ajax is forced to retreat, seeing that Zeus is clearly favoring  <START:person> Hector <END> .
 <START:person> Hector <END>  and the Trojans succeed in burning one Greek ship, the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war.
Ajax is responsible for the death of many Trojans lords, including Phorcys.
Ajax often fought in tandem with his brother  <START:person> Teucer <END> , known for his skill with the bow.
Ajax would wield his magnificent shield, as  <START:person> Teucer <END>  stood behind picking off enemy Trojans.
 <START:person> Achilles <END>  was absent during these encounters because of his feud with Agamemnon.
In Book 9, Agamemnon and the other Mycenaean chiefs send Ajax, Odysseus and Phoenix to the tent of Achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight.
Although Ajax speaks earnestly and is well received, he does not succeed in convincing Achilles.
When Patroclus is killed,  <START:person> Hector <END>  tries to steal his body.
Ajax, assisted by  <START:person> Menelaus <END> , succeeds in fighting off the Trojans and taking the body back with his chariot; however, the Trojans had already stripped Patroclus of Achilles' armor.
Ajax's prayer to Zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial.
According to  <START:person> Hyginus <END> , in total, Ajax killed 28 people at Troy.
Death.
Like most of the other Greek leaders, Ajax is alive and well as the "Iliad" comes to a close.
When  <START:person> Achilles <END>  dies, killed by Paris (with help from Apollo), Ajax and  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  are the heroes who fight against the Trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion, Patroclus.
Ajax, with his great shield and spear, manages to drive off the Trojans, while  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  pulls the body to his chariot, and rides away with it to safety.
After the burial, each claims  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' magical armor for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts.
After several days of competition, Odysseus and Ajax are tied for the ownership of the divine armor, which had been forged on Mount Olympus by the smith-god Hephaestus.
It is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor.
Ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the Greeks, including saving the ships from  <START:person> Hector <END> , and driving him off with a massive rock, he deserves the armor.
However,  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  proves to be more eloquent, and the council gives him the armor.
Ajax, "Unconquered", and furious, falls upon his own sword, "conquered by his [own] sorrow".
The Belvedere Torso, a marble torso now in the Vatican Museums, is considered to depict Ajax "in the act of contemplating his suicide".
In Sophocles' play "Ajax", a famous retelling of Ajax's demise, after the armor is awarded to Odysseus Ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill Agamemnon and  <START:person> Menelaus <END> .
Athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision, and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them, imagining they are the Achaean leaders, including Odysseus and Agamemnon.
When he comes to his senses, covered in blood, he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor, and decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than live in shame.
He does so with the same sword which  <START:person> Hector <END>  gave him when they exchanged presents.
From his blood sprang a red flower, as at the death of Hyacinthus, which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name "Ai," also expressive of lament.
His ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the Rhoetean promontory at the entrance of the Hellespont.
Ajax's half-brother  <START:person> Teucer <END>  stood trial before his father for not bringing Ajax's body or weapons back.
 <START:person> Teucer <END>  was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence.
He was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home, the island of Salamis off the coast of Athens.
Homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of Ajax's death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' armor; when Odysseus visits Hades, he begs the soul of Ajax to speak to him, but Ajax, still resentful over the old quarrel, refuses and descends silently back into Erebus.
Like  <START:person> Achilles <END> , he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death on the island of Leuke at the mouth of the Danube.
Ajax, who in the post-Homeric legend is described as the grandson of Aeacus and the great-grandson of Zeus, was the tutelary hero of the island of Salamis, where he had a temple and an image, and where a festival called "Aianteia" was celebrated in his honour.
At this festival a couch was set up, on which the panoply of the hero was placed, a practice which recalls the Roman Lectisternium.
The identification of Ajax with the family of  <START:person> Aeacus <END>  was chiefly a matter which concerned the Athenians, after Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion Solon is said to have inserted a line in the "Iliad" (2.557–558), for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island.
Ajax then became an Attic hero; he was worshiped at Athens, where he had a statue in the market-place, and the tribe "Aiantis" was named after him.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END>  also relates that a gigantic skeleton, its kneecap 5 in in diameter, appeared on the beach near Sigeion, on the Trojan coast; these bones were identified as those of Ajax.
Other.
There is a legend that Ajax founded the city of Ajaccio in the mediterranean island of Corsica (now part of France) and gave it his name.
Palace.
In 2001,  <START:person> Yannos Lolos <END>  began excavating a Mycenaean palace on the island of Salamis which he supposed to be the home of the mythological Aiacid dynasty.
The ruins have been excavated at a site near the village of Kanakia of Salamis, a few miles off the coast of Athens.
The multi-story structure covers 750 m2 and had perhaps 30 rooms.
The Trojan War is supposed by many to have occurred at the height of the Mycenaean civilization (see discussion of Troy VII), roughly the point at which this palace appears to have been abandoned.
 <START:person> Alexander II of Epirus  Alexander II <END>  was a king of Epirus, and the son of  <START:person> Pyrrhus <END>  and  <START:person> Lanassa <END> , the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant  <START:person> Agathocles <END> .
Reign.
He succeeded his father as king in 272 BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with  <START:person> Antigonus II Gonatas <END> , whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of Macedon.
He was, however, dispossessed of both Macedon and Epirus by  <START:person> Demetrius II of Macedon <END> , the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the Acarnanians.
By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus.
It appears that he was in alliance with the Aetolians.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  married his paternal half-sister Olympias, by whom he had two sons,  <START:person> Pyrrhus <END> ,  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  and a daughter, Phthia.
On the death of  <START:person> Alexander <END> , around 242 BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to  <START:person> Demetrius <END> .
There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.
The former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephant's head.
The reverse represents  <START:person> Pallas <END>  holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt.
Relations with India.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  is apparently mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor  <START:person> Ashoka <END> 's Buddhist proselytism.
 <START:person> Alexander of Aphrodisias  Alexander <END>  of Aphrodisias (Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀφροδισιεύς; fl.
200 AD) was a Peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the Ancient Greek commentators on the writings of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> .
He was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria, and lived and taught in Athens at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the Peripatetic school.
He wrote many commentaries on the works of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , extant are those on the "Prior Analytics", "Topics", "Meteorology", "Sense and Sensibilia", and "Metaphysics".
Several original treatises also survive, and include a work "On Fate", in which he argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity; and one "On the Soul".
His commentaries on  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, "the commentator" (ὁ ἐξηγητής).
Life and career.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria and came to Athens towards the end of the 2nd century.
He was a student of the two Stoic, or possibly Peripatetic, philosophers Sosigenes and Herminus, and perhaps of  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  of Mytilene.
At Athens he became head of the Peripatetic school and lectured on Peripatetic philosophy.
 <START:person> Alexander <END> 's dedication of "On Fate" to  <START:person> Septimius Severus <END>  and  <START:person> Caracalla <END> , in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209.
A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as  <START:person> Titus Aurelius Alexander <END> .
His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor  <START:person> Antoninus Pius <END> , while proconsul of Asia.
The inscription honours his father, also called  <START:person> Alexander <END>  and also a philosopher.
This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's corpus should be ascribed to his father.
Commentaries.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  composed several commentaries on the works of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , in which he sought to escape a syncretistic tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> .
His extant commentaries are on "Prior Analytics" (Book 1), "Topics", "Meteorology", "Sense and Sensibilia", and "Metaphysics" (Books 1-5).
The commentary on the "Sophistical Refutations" is deemed spurious, as is the commentary on the final nine books of the "Metaphysics".
The lost commentaries include works on the "De Interpretatione", "Posterior Analytics", "Physics", "On the Heavens", "On Generation and Corruption", "On the Soul", and "On Memory".
Simplicius of Cilicia mentions that  <START:person> Alexander <END>  provided commentary on the quadrature of the lunes, and the corresponding problem of squaring the circle.
In April 2007, it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on  <START:person> Aristotle <END> 's "Categories" in the Archimedes Palimpsest, and  <START:person> Robert Sharples <END>  suggested  <START:person> Alexander <END>  as the most likely author.
Original treatises.
There are also several extant original writings by  <START:person> Alexander <END> .
These include: "On the Soul", "Problems and Solutions", "Ethical Problems", "On Fate", and "On Mixture and Growth".
Three works attributed to him are considered spurious: "Medical Questions", "Physical Problems", and "On Fevers".
Additional works by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  are preserved in Arabic translation, these include: "On the Principles of the Universe", "On Providence", and "Against  <START:person> Galen <END>  on Motion".
"On the Soul" ("De anima") is a treatise on the soul written along the lines suggested by  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  in his own "De anima".
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material ("nous hulikos") and inseparable from the body.
He argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul's immortality.
He identified the active intellect ("nous poietikos"), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with God.
A second book is known as the "Supplement to On the Soul" ("Mantissa").
The "Mantissa" is a series of twenty-five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with psychology.
The remaining twenty pieces cover problems in physics and ethics, of which the largest group deals with questions of vision and light, and the final four with fate and providence.
The "Mantissa" was probably not written by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  in its current form, but much of the actual material may be his.
"Problems and Solutions" ("Quaestiones") consists of three books which, although termed "problems and solutions of physical questions," treat of subjects which are not all physical, and are not all problems.
Among the sixty-nine items in these three books, twenty-four deal with physics, seventeen with psychology, eleven with logic and metaphysics, and six with questions of fate and providence.
It is unlikely that  <START:person> Alexander <END>  wrote all of the "Quaestiones", some may be  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's own explanations, while others may be exercises by his students.
"Ethical Problems" was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the "Quaestiones".
The work is a discussion of ethical issues based on  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's school.
It is likely that the work was not written by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  himself, but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving  <START:person> Alexander <END> .
"On Fate" is a treatise in which  <START:person> Alexander <END>  argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity.
In "On Fate"  <START:person> Alexander <END>  denied three things necessity (Greek: ἀνάγκη), the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature, and determinism in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand (Greek: προκαταβεβλημένος) or predetermined by antecedents (Greek: προηγουμένος).
He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today.
"On Mixture and Growth" discusses the topic of mixture of physical bodies.
It is both an extended discussion (and polemic) on Stoic physics, and an exposition of Aristotelian thought on this theme.
"On the Principles of the Universe" is preserved in Arabic translation.
This treatise is not mentioned in surviving Greek sources, but it enjoyed great popularity in the Muslim world, and a large number of copies have survived.
The main purpose of this work is to give a general account of Aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics, but it also has a polemical tone, and it may be directed at rival views within the Peripatetic school.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  was concerned with filling the gaps of the Aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies, while also presenting a unified picture of the world, both physical and ethical.
The topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the sublunar world of generation and decay.
His principal sources are the "Physics" (book 7), "Metaphysics" (book 12), and the Pseudo-Aristotelian "On the Universe".
"On Providence" survives in two Arabic versions.
In this treatise,  <START:person> Alexander <END>  opposes the Stoic view that divine Providence extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods.
Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.
Influence.
By the 6th century  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's commentaries on  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  were considered so useful that he was referred to as "the commentator" (Greek: ὁ ἐξηγητής).
His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the Arabs, who translated many of them, and he is heavily quoted by Maimonides.
In 1210, the Church Council of Paris issued a condemnation, which probably targeted the writings of  <START:person> Alexander <END>  among others.
In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by  <START:person> Pietro Pomponazzi <END>  (against the Thomists and the Averroists), and by his successor  <START:person> Cesare Cremonini <END> .
This school is known as Alexandrists.
 <START:person> Alexander <END> 's band, an optical phenomenon, is named after him.
Modern editions.
Several of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's works were published in the Aldine edition of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , Venice, 1495–1498; his "De Fato" and "De Anima" were printed along with the works of Themistius at Venice (1534); the former work, which has been translated into Latin by  <START:person> Grotius <END>  and also by  <START:person> Schulthess <END> , was edited by  <START:person> J. C. Orelli <END> ,  <START:person> Zürich <END> , 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by  <START:person> H. Bonitz <END> , Berlin, 1847.
In 1989 the first part of his "On Aristotle Metaphysics" was published as part of the Ancient commentators project.
Since then, other works of his have been translated into English.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson  Andrew Jackson <END>  (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was the seventh President of the United States (1829–1837).
He was born near the end of the colonial era, somewhere near the then-unmarked border between North and South Carolina, into a recently immigrated Scots-Irish farming family of relatively modest means.
During the American Revolutionary War  <START:person> Jackson <END> , whose family supported the revolutionary cause, acted as a courier.
He was captured, at age 13, and mistreated by his British captors.
He later became a lawyer, and in 1796 he was in Nashville and helped found the state of Tennessee.
He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and then to the U.S. Senate.
In 1801,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia, which became his political as well as military base.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  owned hundreds of slaves who worked on the Hermitage plantation which he acquired in 1804.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  killed a man in a duel in 1806, over a matter of honor regarding his wife  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  gained national fame through his role in the War of 1812, most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at the Battle of New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's army was then sent to Florida where he deposed the small Spanish garrison.
This led directly to the treaty which formally transferred Florida from Spain to the United States.
Nominated for president in 1824,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  narrowly lost to  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's supporters then founded what became the Democratic Party.
Nominated again in 1828,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  crusaded against  <START:person> Adams <END>  and the "corrupt bargain" between  <START:person> Adams <END>  and  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  he said cost him the 1824 election.
Building on his base in the West and new support from Virginia and New York, he won by a landslide.
The  <START:person> Adams <END>  campaigners called him and his wife  <START:person> Rachel Jackson <END>  "bigamists"; she died just after the election and he called the slanderers "murderers," swearing never to forgive them.
His struggles with Congress were personified in his personal rivalry with  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , whom  <START:person> Jackson <END>  deeply disliked, and who led the opposition (the emerging Whig Party).
As president, he faced a threat of secession from South Carolina over the "Tariff of Abominations" which Congress had enacted under  <START:person> Adams <END> .
In contrast to several of his immediate successors, he denied the right of a state to secede from the union, or to nullify federal law.
The Nullification Crisis was defused when the tariff was amended and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  threatened the use of military force if South Carolina (or any other state) attempted to secede.
Congress attempted to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States several years before the expiration of its charter, which he opposed.
He vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832, and dismantled it by the time its charter expired in 1836.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the "spoils system" in American politics.
Also, he supported, signed, and enforced the Indian Removal Act, which relocated a number of native tribes to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).
He faced and defeated  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  in the 1832 Presidential Election, and opposed  <START:person> Clay <END>  generally.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  supported his vice president  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , who was elected president in 1836.
He worked to bolster the Democratic Party and helped his friend  <START:person> James K. Polk <END>  win the 1844 presidential election.
Early life and education.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was born on March 15, 1767.
His parents were Scots-Irish colonists  <START:person> Andrew <END>  and  <START:person> Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson <END> , Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ireland two years earlier.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's parents lived in the village of Boneybefore, also in County Antrim.
When they emigrated to America in 1765,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's parents probably landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the Waxhaws region, straddling the border between North and South Carolina.
They brought two children from Ireland,  <START:person> Hugh <END>  (born 1763) and  <START:person> Robert <END>  (born 1764).
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father died in an accident in February 1767, at the age of 29, three weeks before his son  <START:person> Andrew <END>  was born in the Waxhaws area.
His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father.
The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed.
In 1824,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation in Lancaster County, South Carolina.
But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824, which  <START:person> Jackson <END>  opposed.
In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  received a sporadic education in the local "old-field" school.
In 1781, he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop.
Later, he taught school and studied law in Salisbury, North Carolina.
In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved to Jonesborough, in what was then the Western District of North Carolina.
This area later became the Southwest Territory (1790), the precursor to the state of Tennessee.
Revolutionary War service.
During the Revolutionary War,  <START:person> Jackson <END> , at age thirteen, informally helped the local militia as a courier.
His eldest brother,  <START:person> Hugh <END> , died from heat exhaustion during the Battle of Stono Ferry, on June 20, 1779.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  and his brother  <START:person> Robert <END>  were captured by the British and held as prisoners; they nearly starved to death in captivity.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving  <START:person> Jackson <END>  with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British.
While imprisoned, the brothers contracted smallpox.
 <START:person> Robert Jackson <END>  died on April 27, 1781, a few days after their mother  <START:person> Elizabeth <END>  secured the brothers' release.
After being assured  <START:person> Andrew <END>  would recover,  <START:person> Elizabeth Jackson <END>  volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in Charleston harbor, where there had been an outbreak of cholera.
She died from the disease in November 1781, and was buried in an unmarked grave.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  became an orphan at age 14.
Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  blamed the British for his losses.
Legal and political career.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  began his legal career in Jonesborough, now northeastern Tennessee.
Though his legal education was scanty, he knew enough to be a country lawyer on the frontier.
Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law.
Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from assault and battery.
In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor (prosecutor) of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the Territory South of the River Ohio after 1791.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796.
When Tennessee achieved statehood that year,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was elected its U.S. Representative.
The following year, he was elected U.S. Senator as a Democratic-Republican, but he resigned within a year.
(His return to the U.S. Senate in 1823, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.)
In 1798, he was appointed a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court, serving until 1804.
Land speculation and founding of Memphis.
In 1794,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  formed a business with  <START:person> John Overton <END>  "for the purpose of purchasing lands as well those lands without as within military bounds"—overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw.
Upon his return from Florida,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  negotiated the sale of the land from the Chickasaw Nation in 1818 (termed the Jackson Purchase).
He was one of the three original investors who founded Memphis, Tennessee in 1819 (see History of Memphis, Tennessee).
Hermitage plantation.
In addition to his legal and political career,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  prospered as planter, slave owner, and merchant.
He built a home and the first general store in Gallatin, Tennessee in 1803.
The next year he acquired the Hermitage, a 640 acre plantation in Davidson County, near Nashville.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  later added 360 acre to the plantation, which eventually grew to 1050 acres.
The primary crop was cotton, grown by enslaved workers.
Starting with nine slaves,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  held as many as 44 by 1820, and later held up to 150 slaves, making him among the planter elite.
Throughout his lifetime  <START:person> Jackson <END>  may have owned as many as 300 slaves.
African American men, women, and children were enslaved by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  on three sections of the Hermitage plantation.
Slaves lived in extended family units between five and ten persons quartered in 20-foot-square cabins made either of brick or logs.
The size and quality of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times.
To help slaves acquire food staples, in addition to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's rations,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  supplied slaves with guns, knives, and fishing equipment for hunting and fishing.
At times  <START:person> Jackson <END>  paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets.
The Hermitage plantation was a profit-making enterprise and  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who demanded slave loyalty, permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  at various times posted advertisements for his fugitive slaves.
For the standards of his times  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food, housing, and did not prohibit his female slaves from childbirthing.
Military career.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank of colonel.
He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802.
War of 1812.
Creek campaign and treaty.
During the War of 1812, the Shawnee chief  <START:person> Tecumseh <END>  encouraged the "Red Stick" Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements.
He had unified tribes in the Northwest to rise up against the Americans, trying to repel American settlers from those lands north of the Ohio.
Four hundred settlers were killed in the Fort Mims massacre—one of the few instances of Native Americans killing a large number of American settlers and their African-American slaves—which brought the United States into the internal Creek campaign.
Occurring at the same time as the War of 1812, the Creek campaign saw  <START:person> Jackson <END>  command the U.S. forces, which included the Tennessee militia, U.S. regulars, and Cherokee, Choctaw, and Lower Creek warriors.
 <START:person> Sam Houston <END>  and  <START:person> David Crockett <END>  served under  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in this campaign.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  defeated the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814.
US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle, but spared the chief Red Eagle, a mixed-race man also known as  <START:person> William Weatherford <END> .
After the victory,  <START:person> Madison <END> 's Secretary of War  <START:person> Armstrong <END>  ordered Major General  <START:person> Thomas Pinckney <END>  in April 1814 to make the surrender treaty.
 <START:person> Pinckney <END>  made moderate terms of surrender including handing over an unspecified amount of land, the construction of U.S. forts, turning over warriors who instigated hostilities, and agreeing to stop trade with foreign countries.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  opposed the unpopular  <START:person> Pinckney <END>  treaty, desiring to completely destroy the Creek nation.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was promoted Major General and given charge of the Seventh Military District, replacing Major General  <START:person> Thomas Flournoy <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , now commanding general, immediately threw out  <START:person> Pinckney <END> 's treaty and forced severe terms upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies, wresting twenty-two million acres in present-day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European-American settlement.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also confiscated land from Indians who had sided with the Americans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated that the terms must be accepted or the tribe would be forcefully removed to Florida.
On August 9, 1814, 35 Indian elder leaders signed  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Treaty of Fort Jackson.
The warrior faction of the Creek nation and the British, however, did not formally recognize the treaty.
According to author  <START:person> Gloria Jahoda <END> , the Creeks coined their own name for him, " <START:person> Jacksa Chula Harjo <END> " or " <START:person> Jackson <END> , old and fierce".
Battle of New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success.
When British forces threatened New Orleans,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories.
He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops.
They said he was "tough as old hickory" wood on the battlefield, and he acquired the nickname of "Old Hickory".
In the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's 5,000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7,500 British.
At the end of the battle, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing.
The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.
Enforced martial law New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  ordered the arrest of U. S. District Court Judge Dominick Hall in March 1815, after the judge signed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a Louisiana legislator that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had arrested.
 <START:person> Louis Louaillier <END>  had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's refusal to release the militia, after the British ceded the field of battle.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had claimed the authority to declare martial law over the entire City of New Orleans, not merely his "camp."
After ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, a lawyer and after intervention of  <START:person> Joshua Lewis <END> , a State Judge, who was simultaneously serving under  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the militia, and who also signed a writ of habeas corpus against  <START:person> Jackson <END> , his commanding officer, seeking Judge  <START:person> Hall <END> 's release,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  relented.
Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
But they fared better than did the six members of the militia whose executions, ordered by  <START:person> Jackson <END> , would surface as the Coffin Handbills during his 1828 Presidential campaign.
Nonetheless,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the War of 1812.
By a resolution on February 27, 1815,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  received the Thanks of Congress as well as a Congressional Gold Medal.
 <START:person> Alexis de Tocqueville <END> , "underwhelmed" by  <START:person> Jackson <END> , later commented in "Democracy in America" that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  "... was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."
First Seminole War.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  served in the military again during the First Seminole War.
He was ordered by President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  in December 1817 to lead a campaign in Georgia against the Seminole and Creek Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was also charged with preventing Spanish Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves.
Critics later alleged that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  exceeded orders in his Florida actions.
His directions were to "terminate the conflict".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida.
Before going,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote to  <START:person> Monroe <END> , "Let it be signified to me through any channel ... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."
 <START:person> Monroe <END>  gave  <START:person> Jackson <END>  orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.
The Seminole attacked  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Tennessee volunteers.
The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  burned their houses and the crops.
He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the United Kingdom encouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  captured Pensacola, Florida, with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor.
He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects,  <START:person> Robert Ambrister <END>  and  <START:person> Alexander Arbuthnot <END> , who had been supplying and advising the Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (he became known as "Sharp Knife").
The executions, and  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident.
Many in the  <START:person> Monroe <END>  administration called for  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to be censured.
The Secretary of State,  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> , an early believer in Manifest Destiny, defended  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
When the Spanish minister demanded a "suitable punishment" for  <START:person> Jackson <END> ,  <START:person> Adams <END>  wrote back, "Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory ... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact ... a post of annoyance to them."
 <START:person> Adams <END>  used  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the  <START:person> Adams <END> –Onís Treaty.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was subsequently named Florida's military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.
Election of 1824.
The Tennessee legislature nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President in 1822.
It also elected him U.S. Senator again.
By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party.
Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal Congressional nominating caucus, but this had become unpopular.
In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus.
Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary  <START:person> William H. Crawford <END>  for President and  <START:person> Albert Gallatin <END>  for Vice President.
A Pennsylvania convention nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" and was a "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [ <START:person> Crawford <END> ] was the regular democratic candidate".
Gallatin criticized  <START:person> Jackson <END>  as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office".
Besides  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Crawford <END> , the Secretary of State  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END>  and House Speaker  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  were also candidates.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot).
The electoral votes were split four ways, with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  having a plurality.
Because no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the House of Representatives, which chose  <START:person> Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  supporters denounced this result as a "corrupt bargain" because  <START:person> Clay <END>  gave his state's support to  <START:person> Adams <END> , who subsequently appointed  <START:person> Clay <END>  as Secretary of State.
As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for  <START:person> Adams <END> , and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had won the popular vote, some Kentucky politicians criticized  <START:person> Clay <END>  for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the "man of the people" had been robbed by the "corrupt aristocrats of the East".
Election of 1828.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  denounced the "corrupt bargain" that put  <START:person> Adams <END>  in the White House and laid plans for a crusade to oust  <START:person> Adams <END>  from office.
After resigning the Senate in October 1825, he continued his quest for the Presidency.
The Tennessee legislature again nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President.
He attracted Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , and  <START:person> Thomas Ritchie <END>  into his camp ( <START:person> Van Buren <END>  and  <START:person> Ritchie <END>  were previous supporters of  <START:person> Crawford <END> ).
 <START:person> Van Buren <END> , with help from his friends in Philadelphia and Richmond, revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, "restored party rivalries", and forged a national organization of durability.
The  <START:person> Jackson <END>  coalition handily defeated  <START:person> Adams <END>  in 1828.
During the election,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's opponents referred to him as a "jackass".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out.
However, it later became the symbol for the Democratic Party when cartoonist  <START:person> Thomas Nast <END>  popularized it.
The campaign was very much a personal one.
As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events.
Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's wife  <START:person> Rachel <END>  of bigamy.
Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794).
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife.
 <START:person> Rachel <END>  died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve.
He blamed the  <START:person> Adams <END>  campaigners for her death.
"May God Almighty forgive her murderers," he swore at her funeral.
"I never can."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards or morality.
(He was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation work.)
Presidency 1829–1837.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's name has been associated with the spread of democracy in terms of the passing of political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties.
"The Age of Jackson" shaped the national agenda and American politics.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's philosophy as President followed much in the same line as  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> , advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency held a high moralistic tone; having as a planter himself agrarian sympathies, a limited view of states rights and the federal government.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values.
When South Carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.
On March 4, 1829,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was the first President to invite the public to attend the White House ball honoring his first inauguration.
Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes.
The crowd became so large that  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken.
Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President.
The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's raucous populism earned him the nickname "King Mob".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that the president's authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics.
Instead of choosing party favorites,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  chose "plain, businessmen" whom he intended to control.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  chose  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  as Secretary of State,  <START:person> John Eaton <END>  Secretary of War,  <START:person> Samuel Ingham <END>  Secretary of Treasury,  <START:person> John Branch <END>  Secretary of Navy,  <START:person> John Berrien <END>  as Attorney General, and  <START:person> William T. Barry <END>  as postmaster general.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's first choice of Cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip, especially between Eaton, Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> , and  <START:person> Van Buren <END> .
By the Spring of 1831, only  <START:person> Barry <END>  remained, while the rest of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's cabinet had been discharged.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's following cabinet selections worked better together.
 <START:person> Eaton <END>  affair.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his first years in office responding to what came to be known as the  <START:person> Eaton <END>  affair.
Vicious Washington D.C. gossip circulated among  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Cabinet members and their wives including Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> 's wife Floride concerning Secretary of War  <START:person> John H. Eaton <END>  and his wife  <START:person> Peggy <END> .
Bitter rumors spread that  <START:person> Peggy <END>  was loose in her morals while working at her father's tavern when her naval officer husband was away at sea.
After  <START:person> Peggy <END> 's husband died at sea, both  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and  <START:person> Peggy <END>  were criticized for their perceived early marriage.
Initially  <START:person> Jackson <END>  thought that  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  was behind the gossip, but then he eventually concluded  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  was responsible for spreading the rumors.
Both  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  defended  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and his wife  <START:person> Peggy <END> , however  <START:person> Calhoun <END> 's wife  <START:person> Floride <END>  and the wives of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's pro-Calhoun Cabinet members publicly shunned both  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and  <START:person> Peggy <END> .
 <START:person> Van Buren <END> ,  <START:person> Eaton <END> , and  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  resigned office over the affair while  <START:person> Jackson <END>  dismissed the rest of his pro-Calhoun cabinet members except Postmaster  <START:person> William T. Barry <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  nominated  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  to be Minister to England, however,  <START:person> Calhoun <END> 's supporters in the Senate blocked the nomination giving  <START:person> Calhoun <END> , who had continued to be Vice President and President of the Senate until December 1832, the deciding vote against  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  and blocked the nomination.
 <START:person> Calhoun <END>  publically castigated and boasted that  <START:person> Van Buren <END> 's political career was over stating the defeated nomination would "...kill him, sir, kill dead.
He will never kick, sir, never kick."
This rumor however proved to be false as  <START:person> Van Buren <END> , who played a leading role in the  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's unofficial Kitchen Cabinet, allied with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and became  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's successor and Vice Presidential candidate in 1832.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also acquired the "Globe" paper that was sympathetic with the  <START:person> Jackson <END>  administration.
Indian removal policy.
Throughout his two terms in office, lasting eight years,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  made approximately 70 treaties with native American tribes both in the South and the Northwest.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked a new era in Indian-Anglo American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates.
The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminole and the Cherokee.
The northwest tribes include the Chippewa, Ottawa, and the Potawatomi.
Though conflict between Indians and American settlers took place in the north and in the south, the problem was worse in the south where the Indian populations were larger.
Indian wars broke out repeatedly, often when native tribes, especially the Muscogee and Seminole Indians, refused to abide by the treaties for various reasons.
The Second Seminole War, started in December 1835, lasted over six years finally ending in August 1842 under President  <START:person> John Tyler <END> .
Though relations between Europeans (and later Americans) and Indians were always complicated, they grew increasingly complicated once American settlements began pushing further west in the years after the American Revolution.
Often these relations were peaceful, though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent, both on the part of American settlers and the Indians.
From  <START:person> George Washington <END>  to  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> , the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly; though by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable.
The problem was especially acute in the south (in particular the lands near the state of Georgia), where Indian populations were larger, denser, and more Americanized than those of the north.
As such, there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem, and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain Indian populations.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , never one known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency.
This contrasted from his immediate predecessor, President  <START:person> John Q. Adams <END> , who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors, that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency thus took place in a new era in Indian-Anglo American relations, in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation.
As such, during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency, Indian relations between the Southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture.
In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  advocated land west of the Mississippi River be set aside for Indian tribes.
Congress had been developing its own Indian relocation bill, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had many supporters in both the Senate and House who agreed with his goal.
On May 26, 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed it into law.
The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.
The passage of the bill was  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's first successful legislative triumph and marked the Democratic party's emergence into American political society.
The passage of the act was especially popular in the South where population growth and the discovery of gold on Cherokee land had increased pressure on tribal lands.
The state of Georgia became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 U.S. Supreme Court decision ("Worcester v. Georgia").
In that decision, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice  <START:person> John Marshall <END> , in writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  is frequently, though incorrectly, attributed with the following response: " <START:person> John Marshall <END>  has made his decision, now let him enforce it".
The quote originated in 1863 from  <START:person> Horace Greeley <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used the Georgia crisis to broker an agreement whereby the Cherokee leaders agreed to a removal treaty.
A group of Cherokees led by  <START:person> John Ridge <END>  negotiated the Treaty of New Echota with  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's representatives.
Ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the Cherokee Nation, and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate.
A group of Cherokees petitioned in protest of the proposed removal, though this wasn't taken up by the Supreme Court or the U.S. Congress, in part due to delays and timing.
The treaty was enforced by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's successor,  <START:person> Van Buren <END> , who sent 7,000 troops to carry out the relocation policy.
Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began.
It was subsequent to this that as many as 4,000 Cherokees died on the "Trail of Tears".
By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.
All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves.
Their methods earned them the title of the "Five Civilized Tribes".
More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's administration, though a few Cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high Smoky Mountains along the North Carolina and Tennessee border.
Initiated reforms.
BEP engraved portrait of  <START:person> Jackson <END>  as President.
In an effort to purge the government from corruption of previous administrations,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments.
During  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's tenure in office, large amounts of public money were put in the hands of public officials.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , who believed appointees should be hired by merit, withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Postmaster  <START:person> Barry <END>  resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  replaced  <START:person> Barry <END>  with  <START:person> Amos Kendall <END> , who went on to implement much needed reforms in the Postal Service.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  repeatedly called for the abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President.
In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term.
So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress."
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's time in the presidency as saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents.
The Service Pension Act of 1832, for instance, provided pensions to veterans “even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need,” while an Act of July 1836 enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband’s pensions.
Rotation in office and spoils system.
Upon assuming the presidency in 1829  <START:person> Jackson <END>  enforced the "Tenure of Office Act", passed earlier into law by President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  declared that rotation of appointments in political office was "a leading principle in the republican creed".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  noted, "In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy.
Opposed to this view however, were  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members.
In practice, this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists.
The number of federal office holders removed by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  were exaggerated by his opponents;  <START:person> Jackson <END>  only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , however, did use his image and presidential power to award his loyal Democratic Party followers by granting them federal office appointments.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's democratic approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office.
Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership  <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated "If he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me."
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's rotation of office theory generated what was later to be called the spoils system, a practice that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  never personally justified.
The political realities of Washington, however, did in the end force  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations.
Historians believe that  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics.
Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington proved to be difficult such as the New York Customs House, the Postal Service, the Departments of Navy and War, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades.
Other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices, forced political party campaign participation, and collection of assessments, did not take place until after  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency.
During  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency, those in opposition to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's purging of office holders, formed the Whig Party, calling  <START:person> Jackson <END>  "King  <START:person> Andrew <END>  I" having feared his military background, and named their party after the English paliamentary Whigs who opposed eighteenth century British monarchy.
Nullification crisis.
Another notable crisis during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's period of office was the "Nullification Crisis", or "secession crisis", of 1828 – 1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs.
Critics alleged that high tariffs (the "Tariff of Abominations") on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South.
Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.
The issue came to a head when Vice President  <START:person> Calhoun <END> , in the South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, South Carolina, that it had the right to "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests.
Although  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  attempted to face down  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.
Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts.
 <START:person> Robert Hayne <END>  began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!"
– a clear challenge to  <START:person> Calhoun <END> .
 <START:person> Calhoun <END>  clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"
At the first Democratic National Convention, which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet,  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  broke from each other politically and  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  replaced  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  as  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's running mate in the 1832 presidential election.
In December 1832,  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.
In response to South Carolina's nullification claim,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  vowed to send troops to South Carolina to enforce the laws.
In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers", stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed".
South Carolina, the President declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution ... forms a "government" not a league ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  asked Congress to pass a "Force Bill" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by  <START:person> Clay <END>  agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff.
The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed both.
The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance.
The Force  <START:person> Bill <END>  became moot because it was no longer needed.
On May 1, 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and disunion and southern confederacy the real object.
The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question."
Foreign affairs.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took office in 1829 spoliation claims, or compensation demands for the capture of American ships and sailors, dating from the Napoleonic era, caused strained relations between the U.S. and French governments.
The French Navy had captured and sent American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules.
According to Secretary of State  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  the relations between the U.S. and France was "hopeless".
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Minister to France  <START:person> William C. Rives <END> , however, through diplomacy was able to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on July 4, 1831 that would award the U.S. ₣ 25,000,000 ($5,000,000) in damages.
The French government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties.
The French king  <START:person> Louis Philippe <END>  I and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies.
By 1834 the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's ire and he became impatient.
In his December 1834 State of the Union address  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was "wholly disappointed" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France.
Feeling insulted by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's words the French people demanded an apology.
In his December 1835 State of the Union Address  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment.
The French government accepted  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's statements as sincere and in February 1836 American reparations were finally paid.
In addition to France, the  <START:person> Jackson <END>  administration successfully settled spoliation claims with Denmark, Portugal, and Spain.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with Russia, Spain, Turkey, Great Britain, and Siam.
Under the treaty of Great Britain American trade was reopened in the West Indies.
The trade agreement with Siam was Americas first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country.
As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , however, was unsuccessful in opening trade with China and Japan.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's agent in Texas, Colonel  <START:person> Anthony Butler <END> , suggested to take Texas over militarily but  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused.
 <START:person> Butler <END>  was later replaced toward the end of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency.
Bank veto and Election of 1832.
In 1816 the Second Bank of the United States was charted by President  <START:person> James Madison <END>  to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812.
In 1823 President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  appointed  <START:person> Nicholas Biddle <END> , the Bank's third and last executive, to run the bank.
In January 1832  <START:person> Biddle <END> , on advice from his friends, submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter four years before the original 20 year charter was to end.
 <START:person> Biddle <END> 's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , believing that Bank was fundamentally a corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners, vetoed the bill.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated the Bank made "the rich richer and the potent more powerful."
The National Republican Party immediately made  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto of the Bank a political issue attempting to undermine  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's political opponents castigated  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto as "the very slang of the leveller and demagogue" believing  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.
During the 1832 Presidential Election the rechartering of the Second National Bank became the primary issue.
The election also demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period.
The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, in May 1832 nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  of Tennessee and  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  of New York.
The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , senator from Kentucky and former Speaker of the House, and  <START:person> John Sergeant <END>  of Pennsylvania.
The Anti-Mason party, who had earlier held their convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated  <START:person> William Wirt <END>  of Maryland and  <START:person> Amos Elmaker <END>  of Pennsylvania; both  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Clay <END>  were masons.
The two rival parties, however, proved to be no match for  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity and the Democratic Party's strong political networks known as "Hickory Clubs" in state and local organization.
Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D.C.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  won the election decisively by a landslide receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes.
 <START:person> Clay <END>  received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes.
 <START:person> Wirt <END>  received only 8 percent of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party folded.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.
Removal of deposits and censure.
In 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  removed federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation.
Three years later,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  issued the Specie Circular, an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins).
The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes, causing the Panic of 1837, which threw the national economy into a deep depression.
It took years for the economy to recover from the damage, however the bulk of the damage was blamed on  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , who took office in 1837.
Whitehouse.gov notes, Basically the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of "boom and bust," which was following its regular pattern, but  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's financial measures contributed to the crash.
His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy bank credit, had swept the West.
To end this speculation,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with hard money--gold or silver.
In 1837 the panic began.
Hundreds of banks and businesses failed.
Thousands lost their lands.
For about five years the United States was wracked by the worst depression thus far in its history.—"Whitehouse.gov" official biography of  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  The U.S. Senate censured  <START:person> Jackson <END>  on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States.
The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Jackson-rival Senator  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
During the proceedings preceding the censure,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  called  <START:person> Clay <END>  "reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel", and the issue was highly divisive within the Senate, however the censure was approved 26–20 on March 28.
When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  supporters, led by  <START:person> Thomas Hart Benton <END> , who though he had once shot  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in a street fight, eventually became an ardent supporter of the president.
Attack and assassination attempt.
The first recorded physical attack on a U.S. president was directed at  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had ordered the dismissal of  <START:person> Robert B. Randolph <END>  from the navy for embezzlement.
On May 6, 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sailed on USS "Cygnet" to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of  <START:person> Mary Ball Washington <END> ,  <START:person> George Washington <END> 's mother.
During a stopover near Alexandria,  <START:person> Randolph <END>  appeared and struck the President.
He fled the scene chased by several members of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's party, including the well-known writer  <START:person> Washington Irving <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  decided not to press charges.
On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative  <START:person> Warren R. Davis <END> ,  <START:person> Richard Lawrence <END> , an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired.
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired.
Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring.
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  was restrained, and legend says that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  attacked  <START:person> Lawrence <END>  with his cane.
Others present, including  <START:person> David Crockett <END> , restrained and disarmed  <START:person> Lawrence <END> .
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  told doctors later his reasons for the shooting.
He blamed  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for the loss of his job.
He claimed that with the President dead, "money would be more plenty" (a reference to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell".
Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King—specifically,  <START:person> Richard III <END> , dead since 1485—and that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was his clerk.
He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.
Afterwards, due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested.
Each time they performed perfectly.
Many believed that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had been protected by the same Providence that they believed also protected their young nation.
The incident became a part of the Jacksonian mythos.
Slavery controversies.
Anti-slavery tracts.
During the summer of 1835, controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation, as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819-1820 Missouri Compromise debates.
Northern abolitionists were sending anti-slavery tracts through the U.S. Postal system into the South.
Pro slavery Southerners objected believing the tracts were "incendiary literature" and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti-slavery tracts into the South.
On July 29, a mob of 300 conservatives broke into the Post Office in Charleston, South Carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts.
The Jackson Administration had Southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism.
However,  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who demanded sectional peace, desired to placate Southerners; at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of Northern Democrats.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Postmaster General  <START:person> Amos Kendall <END>  gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  angrily denounced Northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , who wanted the matter quickly resolved, also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers.
In February 1836, Senator  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's former Vice President, authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti-slavery tracts via the federal mail service.
The bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the House.
Many Southern postmasters, however, disregarded matters of federal law and simply refused to send the anti-slavery tracts.
Anti-slavery Congressional petitions.
In the same year another controversy took place, when abolitionists sent the U.S. House of Representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in Washington D.C.
This infuriated pro-slavery Southerners, who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions.
On December 18, 1835 South Carolina congressman  <START:person> James H. Hammond <END>  strongly denounced abolitionists as "ignorant fanatics".
Northern Whigs objected that anti-slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly.
South Carolina Representative  <START:person> Henry L. Pinckney <END>  drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as "sickly sentimentality", declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery, and tabled ("gag rule") all further anti-slavery petitions.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  leaders in Congress supported the measure, which was passed quickly and without any debate; temporarily suppressing pro-abolitionist activities in Congress.
Recognition of Republic of Texas.
In 1835, pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government; by May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military for the time being, establishing an independent Republic of Texas.
The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and annexation into the United States.
However,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was hesitant with recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election.
The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, while Democratic candidate  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  was elected President.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating a chargé d'affaires on the last day of his Presidency, March 3, 1837.
U.S. Exploring Expedition.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  initially opposed any federal exploration scientific expeditions during his first term in office.
The last scientific federally funded exploration expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led by  <START:person> Stephen H. Harriman <END>  on the Red River of the North.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's predecessor  <START:person> John Q. Adams <END>  attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration expedition in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  assumed office in 1829 he pocketed  <START:person> Adam <END> 's expedition plans.
However, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END>  and the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  and Clark Expedition,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term.
On May 18, 1836  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed a law creating and funding the oceanic United States Exploring Expedition.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  put Secretary of Navy  <START:person> Mahlon Dickerson <END>  in charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's term of office expired.
 <START:person> Dickerson <END>  however proved unfit for the task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, under the next President,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> .
One Brig ship, the USS "Porpoise", later used in the expedition; having been laid down, built, and commissioned by Secretary  <START:person> Dickerson <END>  in May 1836, circumnavigated the world, explored and mapped the Southern Ocean, confirming the existence of the Antarctica continent.
Panic of 1837.
The national economy during the 1830s was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills.
In January 1835,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished.
However, reckless speculation in land and railroads caused what became known as the Panic of 1837.
Contributing factors included  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused Western Banks to relax their lending standards.
Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837, the Specie Circular, that mandated Western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, that transferred federal monies from Eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's "Specie Circular", although designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, led many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver.
The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States.
As a result the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased.
The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound.
Judicial appointments.
In total  <START:person> Jackson <END>  appointed 24 federal judges: six Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States and eighteen judges to the United States district courts.
Later life and death.
After serving two terms as president,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  retired to his Hermitage plantation in 1837.
He immediately began putting the Hermitage in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son,  <START:person> Andrew Jr <END> .
Although he suffered ill health,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  remained influential in both national and state politics.
He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, "I will die with the Union."
Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  to repudiate the "Specie Circular".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  died at his plantation on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic tuberculosis, dropsy, and heart failure.
According to a newspaper account from the "Boon Lick Times" read, "[he] fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed ... but he subsequently revived ... Gen.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  died at the Hermitage at 6 o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant.
When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach.
He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live."
In his will,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  left his entire estate to his adopted son,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members.
Family and personal life.
Shortly after  <START:person> Jackson <END>  first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with  <START:person> Rachel Stockley Donelson <END> , the widow of  <START:person> John Donelson <END> .
Here  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became acquainted with their daughter,  <START:person> Rachel Donelson Robards <END> .
At the time,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  was in an unhappy marriage with Captain  <START:person> Lewis Robards <END> ; he was subject to fits of jealous rage.
The two were separated in 1790.
According to  <START:person> Jackson <END> , he married  <START:person> Rachel <END>  after hearing that  <START:person> Robards <END>  had obtained a divorce.
However, the divorce had never been completed, making  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's marriage to  <START:person> Jackson <END>  bigamous and therefore invalid.
After the divorce was officially completed,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  remarried in 1794.
To complicate matters further, evidence shows that  <START:person> Rachel <END>  had been living with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and referred to herself as Mrs.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  before the petition for divorce was ever made.
It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.
The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor.
By May 1806,  <START:person> Charles Dickinson <END>  had published an attack on  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to a duel.
Since  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  was considered an expert shot,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  determined it would be best to let  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness;  <START:person> Jackson <END>  would wait and take careful aim at  <START:person> Dickinson <END> .
 <START:person> Dickinson <END>  did fire first, hitting  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the chest.
Under the rules of dueling,  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  had to remain still as  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took aim and shot and killed him.
However, the bullet that struck  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled  <START:person> Jackson <END>  with a reputation as a fearful, violent, vengeful man.
He became a social outcast.
 <START:person> Rachel <END>  died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took office as President.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  described her symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast."
After struggling for three days,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  finally died; a distraught  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body.
She had been under extreme stress during the election, and she never did well when  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was away at war or work.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  blamed  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END>  for  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's death because the Whig campaign of 1828 had repeatedly attacked the circumstances for  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's wedding to  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave  <START:person> Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had three adopted sons:  <START:person> Theodore <END> , an Indian about whom little is known,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , the son of  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's brother  <START:person> Severn Donelson <END> , and  <START:person> Lyncoya <END> , a Creek Indian orphan adopted by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  after the Creek War.
 <START:person> Lyncoya <END>  died of tuberculosis in 1828, at the age of sixteen.
The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children.
 <START:person> John Samuel Donelson <END> ,  <START:person> Daniel Smith Donelson <END>  and  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Donelson <END>  were the sons of  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's brother  <START:person> Samuel Donelson <END> , who died in 1804.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson Hutchings <END>  was  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's orphaned grand nephew.
 <START:person> Caroline Butler <END> ,  <START:person> Eliza Butler <END> ,  <START:person> Edward Butler <END> , and  <START:person> Anthony Butler <END>  were the orphaned children of  <START:person> Edward Butler <END> , a family friend.
They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.
The widower  <START:person> Jackson <END>  invited  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's niece  <START:person> Emily Donelson <END>  to serve as host at the White House.
 <START:person> Emily <END>  was married to  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Donelson <END> , who acted as  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the American Party ticket.
The relationship between the President and  <START:person> Emily <END>  became strained during the Petticoat affair, and the two became estranged for over a year.
They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House host.
 <START:person> Sarah Yorke Jackson <END> , the wife of  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , became co-host of the White House in 1834.
It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady.
 <START:person> Sarah <END>  took over all hosting duties after  <START:person> Emily <END>  died from tuberculosis in 1836.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used Rip Raps as a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.
Temperament.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's quick temper was notorious.
Brands says, "His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him and defamed even his wife,  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
He dueled in her defense and his own, suffering grievous wounds that left him with bullet fragments lodged about his body."
However,  <START:person> Remini <END>  is of the opinion that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs.
Brands also notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper: On the last day of the presidency,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  or to hang  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ."
Physical appearance.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a lean figure, standing at 6 feet, 1 inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64 kg) on average.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61.
He had penetrating deep blue eyes.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake.
Religious faith.
About a year after retiring the presidency,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a Freemason, having been initiated at Masonic Lodge, Harmony No. 1 in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee.
He was the only U.S. president to have been a Grandmaster of a State Lodge until  <START:person> Harry S. Truman <END>  in 1945.
His Masonic apron is on display in the Tennessee State Museum.
An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  on U.S. postage.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on U.S. Postage more than the usual two or three times.
He died in 1845, but the U.S. Post Office did not release a postage stamp in his honor until 18 years after his death, with the issue of 1863, a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the 'Black Jack'.
In contrast, the first  <START:person> Warren G. Harding <END>  stamp was released only one month after his death,  <START:person> Lincoln <END> , one year exactly.
As  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait.
In all,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  has appeared on thirteen different U.S. postage stamps, more than that of most U.S. presidents; only Washington,  <START:person> Lincoln <END> , and  <START:person> Franklin <END>  (who was not a president) have appeared more often.
During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two Confederate postage stamps bearing  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's portrait, one a and the other a , both issued in 1863.
Popular culture depictions.
The actor  <START:person> Hugh Sothern <END>  played the character of General  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  in the 1938 film "The Buccaneer", and  <START:person> Charlton Heston <END>  played  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  in the 1953 film, "The President's Lady" and the 1958 film, "The Buccaneer".
 <START:person> Basil Ruysdael <END>  played  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in Walt Disney's 1955 " <START:person> Davy Crockett <END> " TV miniseries and subsequent film release.

Affixes may be derivational, like English "-ness" and "pre-", or inflectional, like English plural "-s" and past tense "-ed".
They are bound morphemes by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be separable affixes.
Affixation is, thus, the linguistic process speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.

Affixes are divided into plenty of categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem.
"Prefix" and "suffix" are extremely common terms.
"Infix" and "circumfix" are less so, as they are not important in European languages.
The other terms are uncommon.
"Prefix" and "suffix" may be subsumed under the term "adfix" in contrast to "infix."
When marking text for interlinear glossing, as in the third column in the chart above, simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens.
Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets.
Reduplication is often shown with a tilde.
Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash.
Lexical affixes.
"Lexical affixes" (or "semantic affixes") are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as incorporated nouns within verbs and as elements of compound nouns.
In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form.
Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.
Lexical affixes are relatively rare.
The Wakashan, Salishan, and Chimakuan languages all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest of the North America.
The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings.
Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of Northern Straits Saanich written in the Saanich orthography and in Americanist notation: Lexical suffixes when compared with free nouns often have a more generic or general meaning.
For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such "saltwater", "whitewater", etc.).
In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become grammaticalized to various degrees.
Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs.
Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic arguments just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns.
 <START:person> Gerdts <END>  (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the Halkomelem language (the word order here is verb–subject–object): In sentence (1), the verb "wash" is šak’ʷətəs where šak’ʷis the root and -ət and -əs are inflectional suffixes.
The subject "the woman" is łə słeniʔ and the object "the baby" is łə qeq.
In this sentence, "the baby" is a free noun.
(The niʔ here is an auxiliary, which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)
In sentence (2), "baby" does not appear as a free noun.
Instead it appears as the lexical suffix -əyəł which is affixed to the verb root šk’ʷ(which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here).
Note how the lexical suffix is neither "the baby" (definite) nor "a baby" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.
Orthographic affixes.
In orthography, the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters.
For example,  <START:person> Maya <END>  glyphs are generally compounds of a "main sign" and smaller "affixes" joined at its margins.
These are called "prefixes, superfixes, postfixes," and "subfixes" according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph.
A small glyph placed inside another is called an "infix."
Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the Indic alphabets.
For example, the Tibetan alphabet utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.

</dl>   <START:person> Augustin-Louis Cauchy  Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy <END>  (]; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician reputed as a pioneer of analysis.
He was one of the first to state and prove theorems of calculus rigorously, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors.
He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra.
A profound mathematician,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors.
His writings range widely in mathematics and mathematical physics.
"More concepts and theorems have been named for  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy)."
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks.
He was a devout Roman Catholic, strict Bourbon royalist, and a close associate of the Jesuit order.
Biography.
Youth and education.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was the son of  <START:person> Louis François Cauchy <END>  (1760–1848) and  <START:person> Marie-Madeleine Desestre <END> .
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had two brothers,  <START:person> Alexandre Laurent Cauchy <END>  (1792–1857), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and  <START:person> Eugene François Cauchy <END>  (1802–1877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  married  <START:person> Aloise de Bure <END>  in 1818.
She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's works.
By her he had two daughters,  <START:person> Marie Françoise Alicia <END>  (1819) and  <START:person> Marie Mathilde <END>  (1823).
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's father ( <START:person> Louis François Cauchy <END> ) was a high official in the Parisian Police of the New Régime.
He lost his position because of the French Revolution (July 14, 1789) that broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born.
The  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  family survived the revolution and the following Reign of Terror (1794) by escaping to Arcueil, where  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  received his first education, from his father.
After the execution of Robespierre (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris.
There  <START:person> Louis-François Cauchy <END>  found himself a new bureaucratic job, and quickly moved up the ranks.
When  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END>  came to power (1799),  <START:person> Louis-François Cauchy <END>  was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under Laplace (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics).
The famous mathematician Lagrange was also no stranger in the  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  family.
On Lagrange's advice,  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  was enrolled in the École Centrale du Panthéon, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802.
Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and Humanities.
In spite of these successes,  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the École Polytechnique.
In 1805 he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam, and he was admitted.
One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education.
The school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting.
Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the École des Ponts et Chaussées (School for Bridges and Roads).
He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors.
Engineering days.
After finishing school in 1810,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where  <START:person> Napoleon <END>  intended to build a naval base.
Here  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  stayed for three years, and although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the "Première Classe" (First Class) of the Institut de France.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's first two manuscripts (on polyhedra) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of conic sections) was rejected.
In September 1812, now 23 years old, after becoming ill from overwork,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  returned to Paris.
Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position.
Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior.
The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric functions, the symmetric group and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations).
He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815.
In 1815  <START:person> Napoleon <END>  was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king  <START:person> Louis XVIII <END>  took the restoration in hand.
The Académie des Sciences was re-established in March 1816;  <START:person> Lazare Carnot <END>  and  <START:person> Gaspard Monge <END>  were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them.
The reaction by  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's peers was harsh; they considered his acceptance of membership of the Academy an outrage, and  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  thereby created many enemies in scientific circles.
Professor at École Polytechnique.
In November 1815,  <START:person> Louis Poinsot <END> , who was an associate professor at the École Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship.
One of his great successes at that time was the proof of  <START:person> Fermat <END> 's polygonal number theorem.
However, the fact that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons, doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot.
He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the École Polytechnique.
In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was promoted to full professor.
When  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents.
His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride,  <START:person> Aloïse de Bure <END> , five years his junior.
The  <START:person> de Bure <END>  family were printers and booksellers, and published most of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's works.
 <START:person> Aloïse <END>  and  <START:person> Augustin <END>  were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice.
In 1819 the couple's first daughter,  <START:person> Marie Françoise Alicia <END> , was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter,  <START:person> Marie Mathilde <END> .
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had two brothers:  <START:person> Alexandre Laurent Cauchy <END> , who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and  <START:person> Eugène François Cauchy <END> , a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.
The conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  perfectly.
In 1824  <START:person> Louis XVIII <END>  died, and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
During these years  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another.
He received cross appointments at the Collège de France, and the Faculté des Sciences of the University.
In exile.
In July 1830 France underwent another revolution.
 <START:person> Charles X <END>  fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king  <START:person> Louis-Philippe <END>  (of the House of Orléans).
Riots, in which uniformed students of the École Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's home in Paris.
These events marked a turning point in  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> , shaken by the fall of the government, and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind.
He spent a short time at Fribourg in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime.
He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required.
In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the King of Sardinia (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him.
He taught in Turin during 1832–1833.
In 1831, he had been elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
In August 1833  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  left Turin for Prague, to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old  <START:person> Duke of Bordeaux Henri d'Artois <END>  (1820–1883), the exiled Crown  <START:person> Prince <END>  and grandson of  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
As a professor of the École Polytechnique,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material.
The young  <START:person> Duke <END>  had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch.
Although  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.
During his civil engineering days,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of telling his pupil this; with great malice, the young  <START:person> Duke <END>  went about saying that Mister  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  started his career in the sewers of Paris.
His role as tutor lasted until the  <START:person> Duke <END>  became eighteen years old, in September 1838.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics.
The only good that came out of this episode was  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's promotion to  <START:person> Baron <END> , a title that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  set great store by.
In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was finally reunited with his family, after four years of exile.
Last years.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838.
He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance.
However, he desperately wanted to regain a formal position in Parisian science.
In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau des Longitudes.
This Bureau had some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members.
Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could "forget" about the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it.
The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea – mainly the longitudinal coordinate, since latitude is easily determined from the position of the sun.
Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.
In November 1839  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with.
Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election.
For four years  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers.
Still  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics.
In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy.
He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by  <START:person> John Colson <END> .
The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was finally replaced by  <START:person> Poinsot <END> .
Throughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of Church and State.
After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally.
He lent his prestige and knowledge to the École Normale Écclésiastique, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges.
He also took part in the founding of the Institut Catholique.
The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France.
These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who, on the whole, supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution.
When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Collège de France in 1843,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  applied for it, but got just three out of 45 votes.
The year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France.
King  <START:person> Louis-Philippe <END> , fearful of sharing the fate of  <START:person> Louis XVI <END> , fled to England.
The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy.
On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Faculté de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy.
After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of  <START:person> Louis Napoleon Bonaparte <END> , nephew of  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END> , and son of  <START:person> Napoleon <END> 's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland.
Soon (early 1852) the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name  <START:person> Napoleon III <END> .
Not unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors.
Not always does history repeat itself, however, because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67.
He received the Last Rites and died at 4 a.m. on May 23, 1857.
His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.
Work.
Early work.
The genius of  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was illustrated in his simple solution of the problem of Apollonius—describing a circle touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of  <START:person> Euler <END> 's formula on polyhedra in 1811, and in several other elegant problems.
More important is his memoir on wave propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series, where he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series.
In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers.
He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.
Wave theory, mechanics, elasticity.
In the theory of light he worked on Fresnel's wave theory and on the dispersion and polarization of light.
He also contributed significant research in mechanics, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter.
He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media.
He introduced a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the Cauchy stress tensor.
In elasticity, he originated the theory of stress, and his results are nearly as valuable as those of  <START:person> Siméon Poisson <END> .
Number theory.
Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the  <START:person> Fermat <END>  polygonal number theorem.
Complex functions.
Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory.
The first pivotal theorem proved by  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , now known as "Cauchy's integral theorem", was the following: where "f"("z") is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve "C" (contour) lying in the complex plane.
The "contour integral" is taken along the contour "C".
The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  presented to the Académie des Sciences (then still called "First Class of the Institute") on August 11, 1814.
In full form the theorem was given in 1825.
The 1825 paper is seen by many as  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's most important contribution to mathematics.
In 1826  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  gave a formal definition of a residue of a function.
This concept regards functions that have poles—isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity.
If the complex-valued function "f"("z") can be expanded in the neighborhood of a singularity "a" as where φ("z") is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then "f" is said to have a pole of order "n" in the point "a".
If "n" = 1, the pole is called simple.
The coefficient "B"1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function "f" at "a".
If "f" is non-singular at "a" then the residue of "f" is zero at "a".
Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to, where we replaced "B"1 by the modern notation of the residue.
In 1831, while in Turin,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin.
In the first he proposed the formula now known as  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's integral formula, where "f"("z") is analytic on "C" and within the region bounded by the contour "C" and the complex number "a" is somewhere in this region.
The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise.
Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at "z" = "a".
In the second paper he presented the residue theorem, where the sum is over all the "n" poles of "f"("z") on and within the contour "C".
These results of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers.
For quite some time, contemporaries of  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated.
Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with  <START:person> Pierre-Alphonse Laurent <END>  being the first mathematician, besides  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , making a substantial contribution (his Laurent series published in 1843).
Cours d'Analyse.
In his book "Cours d'Analyse"  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  stressed the importance of rigor in analysis.
"Rigor" in this case meant the rejection of the principle of "Generality of algebra" (of earlier authors such as  <START:person> Euler <END>  and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and infinitesimals.
 <START:person> Judith Grabiner <END>  wrote  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was "the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe."
The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and formula_6 arguments were introduced into Calculus.
Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: "The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself."
 <START:person> M. Barany <END>  claims that the École mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's better judgement .
 <START:person> Gilain <END>  notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to "Analyse Algébrique" was reduced in 1825,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus.
 <START:person> Laugwitz <END>  (1989) and  <START:person> Benis-Sinaceur <END>  (1973) point out that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero.
There has been a vast body of literature written about  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's notion of "infinitesimally small quantities", arguing they lead from everything from the usual "epsilontic" definitions or to the notions of non-standard analysis.
The consensus is that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used.
 <START:person> Taylor <END> 's theorem.
He was the first to prove  <START:person> Taylor <END> 's theorem rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder.
He wrote a textbook (see the illustration) for his students at the École Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible.
In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught.
Also  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book: Cauchy condensation test.
In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook.
In spite of these,  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods; thus one of his theorems was exposed to a "counter-example" by  <START:person> Abel <END> , later fixed by the introduction of the notion of uniform continuity.
Argument principle, stability.
In a paper published in 1855, two years before  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the "Argument Principle" in many modern textbooks on complex analysis.
In modern control theory textbooks, the Cauchy argument principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist stability criterion, which can be used to predict the stability of negative feedback amplifier and negative feedback control systems.
Thus  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.
Output.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was very productive, in number of papers second only to  <START:person> Leonhard Euler <END> .
It took almost a century to collect all his writings into 27 large volumes: His greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced; these are mainly embodied in his three great treatises: His other works include: Politics and religious beliefs.
 <START:person> Augustin-Louis Cauchy <END>  grew up in the house of a staunch royalist.
This made his father flee with the family to Arcueil during the French Revolution.
Their life there during that time was apparently hard;  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END> 's father,  <START:person> Louis François <END> , spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period.
A paragraph from an undated letter from  <START:person> Louis François <END>  to his mother in Rouen says: We never had more than a half pound of bread — and sometimes not even that.
This we supplement with little supply of hard crackers and rice that we are allotted.
Otherwise, we are getting along quite well, which is the important thing and goes to show that human beings can get by with little.
I should tell you that for my children's pap I still have a bit of fine flour, made from wheat that I grew on my own land.
I had three bushels, and I also have a few pounds of potato starch.
It is as white as snow and very good, too, especially for very young children.
It, too, was grown on my own land.
In any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
He was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint  <START:person> Vincent de Paul <END> .
He also had links to the Society of  <START:person> Jesus <END>  and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so.
His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for  <START:person> Charles Hermite <END>  during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic.
It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Potato Famine.
His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues.
He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed.
 <START:person> Niels Henrik Abel <END>  called him a "bigoted Catholic" and added he was "mad and there is nothing that can be done about him", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when  <START:person> Guglielmo Libri Carucci <END>  dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause.
When  <START:person> Libri <END>  was accused of stealing books he was replaced by  <START:person> Joseph Liouville <END>  rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy.
Another dispute with political overtones concerned  <START:person> Jean Marie Constant Duhamel <END>  and a claim on inelastic shocks.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was later shown, by  <START:person> Jean-Victor Poncelet <END> , to be wrong.
Aimery of Jerusalem  Aimery (Latin "Aimericus"; 1145 – 1 April 1205), born  <START:person> Aimery <END>  of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> , was the first King of Cyprus (1194–1205) and tenth King of Jerusalem (1197–1205).
He was an older brother of  <START:person> Guy of Lusignan <END> .
Older scholarship mistook the names Aimery and  <START:person> Amalric <END>  ( <START:person> Amaury <END> ) as variant spellings of the same name, so these historians erroneously added numbers for kings  <START:person> Amalric <END>  I (1163–74) and  <START:person> Amalric <END>  II (actually Aimery).
Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king.
Confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries.
The  <START:person> Lusignan <END>  family was noted for its many Crusaders.
Aimery and Guy were sons of  <START:person> Hugh VIII <END>  of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> , who had himself campaigned in the Holy Land in the 1160s.
After being expelled from Poitou by their overlord,  <START:person> Richard <END>  the Lion-hearted, for the murder of  <START:person> Patrick <END>  of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury,  <START:person> Aimery <END>  arrived in Palestine c. 1174, Guy possibly later.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  married  <START:person> Eschiva <END> , daughter of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  of Ibelin.
He then took service with  <START:person> Agnes of Courtenay <END> , wife of  <START:person> Reginald <END>  of Sidon and mother of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  IV of Jerusalem.
The pro-Ibelin "Chronicle of Ernoul" later claimed that he was her lover, but it is likely that she and  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  IV were attempting to separate him from the political influence of his wife's family.
He was appointed Constable of Jerusalem soon after 22 April 1179.
 <START:person> Guy <END>  married the king's widowed older sister, Sibylla of Jerusalem in 1180, and so gained a claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  was among those captured with his brother after the disastrous  <START:person> Battle of Hattin <END>  in 1187.
In 1194, on the death of Guy, he became King of Cyprus.
By his first wife,  <START:person> Eschiva <END>  of  <START:person> Ibelin <END> , he was the father of  <START:person> Hugh <END>  I of Cyprus and was crowned in Nicosia on 22 September 1197.
After  <START:person> Eschiva <END> 's death in October 1197 he married  <START:person> Isabella <END> , the daughter of  <START:person> Amalric <END>  of Jerusalem by his second marriage, and became King of Jerusalem in right of his wife and was crowned at Acre in January 1198.
This was only possible, because the candidacy for the crown of  <START:person> Aimery <END> , who was a vassal of Roman-German Emperor  <START:person> Henry <END>  VI., was supported by the German crusaders.
In 1198, at the end of the Crusade of 1197, he was able to procure a five years' truce with the Muslims, owing to the struggle between  <START:person> Saladin <END> 's brothers and his sons for the inheritance of his territories.
The truce was disturbed by raids on both sides, but in 1204 it was renewed for six years.
Many members of the royal family died in rapid succession in early 1205, including  <START:person> Aimery <END>  himself.
 <START:person> Aimery <END> 's two older sons, Guy and John, boys of about eight years of age, died early in 1205.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  died of dysentery (allegedly brought on by "a surfeit of white mullet") or even poisoned at Saint Jean d'Acre on 1 April 1205, just after his son  <START:person> Aimery <END>  and four days before his wife, and was buried at Saint Sophia, Nicosia.
The kingdom of Cyprus passed to  <START:person> Hugh <END> , his only surviving son, while the Kingdom of Jerusalem passed to  <START:person> Maria <END> , the daughter of  <START:person> Isabella <END>  by her previous marriage with  <START:person> Conrad of Montferrat <END> .
Wives and children.
His first wife, married before 29 October 1174, was Eschiva of Ibelin (c.
1160 – Cyprus in Winter 1196–1197), daughter of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  of Ibelin and first wife  <START:person> Richilde de Bethsan <END>  or  <START:person> Bessan <END> .
They had six children: His second wife was  <START:person> Queen Isabella <END>  of Jerusalem, married January 1198 in Acre.
They had three children:   <START:person> Ambroise  Ambroise <END> , sometimes  <START:person> Ambroise <END>  of Normandy, (flourished c. 1190) was a  <START:person> Norman <END>  poet and chronicler of the Third Crusade, author of a work called "L'Estoire de la guerre sainte", which describes in rhyming Old French verse the adventures of  <START:person> Richard Coeur de Lion <END>  as a crusader.
The poem is known to us only through one Vatican manuscript, and long escaped the notice of historians.
The credit for detecting its value belongs to  <START:person> Gaston Paris <END> , although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the "Monumenta Germaniae Historica", who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885).
 <START:person> Ambroise <END>  followed  <START:person> Richard <END>  I as a noncombatant, and not improbably as a court-minstrel.
He speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at Messina, in Cyprus, at the siege of Acre, and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.
 <START:person> Ambroise <END>  is surprisingly accurate in his chronology; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his pilgrimage.
He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention.
He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the Saracens, against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the "Polein" party which supported  <START:person> Conrad <END>  of Montferrat against Guy of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> .
He is rather to be treated as a biographer than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects.
Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190–1192 in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
Books 2–6 of the "Itinerarium Regis Ricardi", a Latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by  <START:person> Richard <END> , a canon of Holy Trinity, London, are closely related to  <START:person> Ambroise <END> 's poem.
They were formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which  <START:person> Ambroise <END>  based his work, but that can no longer be maintained.
American English  American English, or U.S. English, is a set of dialects of the English language used mostly in the United States.
Approximately two-thirds of the world's native speakers of English live in the U.S. The variety of American English that is considered by many speakers to be the most free from regional, ethnic, or cultural distinctions is the dialect known as General American.
English is the most widely spoken language in the United States.
English is the common language used by the federal government and is considered the "de facto" language of the country because of its widespread use.
English has been given official status by 30 of the 50 state governments.
As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States District Court for the territory.
The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization.
The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Since then, American English has been influenced by the languages of West Africa, the Native American population, German, Irish, Spanish, and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the U.S. Phonology.
Compared with English as spoken in England, North American English is more homogeneous.
Some distinctive accents can be found on the East Coast (for example, in eastern New England, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore) partly because these areas were in close contact with England and imitated prestigious varieties of English at a time when these were undergoing changes.
In addition, many speech communities on the East Coast have existed in their present locations for centuries, while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing United States and developed a far more general linguistic pattern.
Studies on historical usage of English in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply evolve from period British English, but rather retained many archaic features contemporary British English has since lost.
Most North American speech is rhotic, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was rhotic.
Rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of Hiberno-English, West Country English and Scottish English.
In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter "r" is a postalveolar approximant [ɹ̠] or retroflex approximant [ɻ] rather than a trill or a tap (as often heard, for example, in Scotland or India).
A unique "bunched tongue" variant of the approximant "r" sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.
The loss of syllable-final "r" in North America, known as non-rhoticity, is confined mostly to the accents of eastern New England, New York City and surrounding areas and the coastal portions of the South, and African American Vernacular English.
In rural tidewater Virginia and eastern New England, 'r' is non-rhotic in accented (such as "bird", "work", "first", "birthday") as well as unaccented syllables, although this is declining among the younger generation of speakers.
Dropping of syllable-final "r" sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if "r" is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant (for example, many North Americans drop the first 'r' in "particular").
In England, the lost "r" was often changed into [ə] (schwa), giving rise to a new class of falling diphthongs.
Furthermore, the "er" sound of "fur or "butter, is realized in AmE as a monophthongal r-colored vowel (stressed [ɝ] or unstressed [ɚ] as represented in the IPA).
This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech.
Some other English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate: On the other hand, North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of English speech: Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include: Vocabulary.
North America has given the English lexicon many thousands of words, meanings, and phrases.
Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally.
Creation of an American lexicon.
The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the Native American languages.
Examples of such names are "opossum, raccoon, squash" and "moose" (from Algonquian).
Other Native American loanwords, such as "wigwam" or "moccasin", describe articles in common use among Native Americans.
The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, "cookie", "cruller", "stoop", and "pit" (of a fruit) from Dutch; "angst, kindergarten, sauerkraut" from German, "levee, portage" ("carrying of boats or goods") and (probably) "gopher" from French; "barbecue, stevedore, and rodeo" from Spanish.
Among the earliest and most notable regular "English" additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, "run, branch, fork, snag, bluff, gulch, neck" (of the woods), "barrens, bottomland, notch, knob, riffle, rapids, watergap, cutoff, trail, timberline" and "divide".
Already existing words such as "creek, slough, sleet" and (in later use) "watershed" received new meanings that were unknown in England.
Other noteworthy American toponyms are found among loanwords; for example, "prairie, butte" (French); "bayou" (Choctaw via Louisiana French); "coulee" (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); "canyon, mesa, arroyo" (Spanish); "vlei, skate, kill" (Dutch, Hudson Valley).
The word "corn", used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant "Zea mays", the most important crop in the U.S., originally named "Indian corn" by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as "grain".
Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by "barn" (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and "team" (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms "range, (corn) crib, truck, elevator, sharecropping" and "feedlot."
"Ranch," later applied to a house style, derives from Mexican Spanish; most Spanish contributions came after the War of 1812, with the opening of the West.
Among these are, other than toponyms, "chaps" (from "chaparreras), plaza, lasso, bronco, , rodeo;" examples of "English" additions from the cowboy era are "bad man, maverick, chuck" ("food") and "Boot Hill;" from the California Gold Rush came such idioms as "hit pay dirt" or "strike it rich."
The word "blizzard" probably originated in the West.
A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb "belittle" and the noun "bid," both first used in writing by  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> .
With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts "(land office, lot, outlands, waterfront," the verbs "locate" and "relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision)," types of property "(log cabin, adobe" in the 18th century; "frame house, apartment, tenement house, shack, " in the 19th century; "project, condominium, townhouse, split-level, mobile home, multi-family" in the 20th century), and parts thereof "(driveway, breezeway, backyard, dooryard; clapboard, siding, trim, baseboard; stoop" (from Dutch), "family room, den;" and, in recent years, "HVAC, central air, walkout basement)."
Ever since the American Revolution, a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are "run (i.e, for office), gubernatorial, primary election, carpetbagger" (after the Civil War), "repeater", "lame duck" (a British term used originally in Banking) and "pork barrel."
Some of these are internationally used (for example, "caucus, gerrymander, filibuster, exit poll)."
19th century onwards.
The development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms.
Typical examples are the vocabulary of "railroading" (see further at rail terminology) and "transportation" terminology, ranging from names of roads (from "dirt roads" and "back roads" to "freeways" and "parkways)" to road infrastructure "(parking lot, overpass, rest area)," and from automotive terminology to "public transit" (for example, in the sentence ""riding" the "subway downtown""); such American introductions as "commuter" (from "commutation ticket), concourse, to board" (a vehicle), "to park, double-park" and "parallel park" (a car), "" or the noun "terminal" have long been used in all dialects of English.
Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations "(bartender, longshoreman, patrolman, hobo, bouncer, bellhop, roustabout, white collar, blue collar, employee, boss" [from Dutch], "intern, busboy, mortician, senior citizen)," businesses and workplaces "(department store, supermarket, thrift store, gift shop, drugstore, motel, main street, gas station, hardware store, savings and loan, hock" [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations "(automated teller machine, smart card, cash register, dishwasher, reservation" [as at hotels], "pay envelope, movie, mileage, shortage, outage, blood bank)."
Already existing English words—such as "store, shop, dry goods, haberdashery, lumber"—underwent shifts in meaning; some—such as "mason, student, clerk", the verbs "can" (as in "canned goods"), "ship, fix, carry, enroll" (as in school), "run" (as in "run a business"), "release" and "haul"—were given new significations, while others (such as "tradesman)" have retained meanings that disappeared in England.
From the world of business and finance came "breakeven, merger, , downsize, disintermediation, bottom line;" from sports terminology came, jargon aside, "Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan" (football); "in the ballpark, out of left field, off base, hit and run," and many other idioms from baseball; gamblers coined "bluff, , ante, bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown;" miners coined "bedrock, bonanza, peter out, pan out" and the verb "prospect" from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with "make the grade, sidetrack, head-on," and the verb "railroad."
A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: "elevator, ground, gasoline;" many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not "(hatchback, sport utility vehicle, station wagon, tailgate, motorhome, truck, pickup truck, to exhaust)."
In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from Yiddish "(chutzpah, schmooze, tush") and German—"hamburger" and culinary terms like "frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, wiener, deli(catessen); scram, kindergarten, gesundheit;" musical terminology "(whole note, half note," etc.); and apparently "cookbook, fresh" ("impudent") and "what gives?"
Such constructions as "Are you coming with?" and "I like to dance" (for "I like dancing") may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.
Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from "OK" and "cool" to "nerd" and "24/7)," while others have not "(have a nice day, for sure);" many are now distinctly old-fashioned "(swell, groovy)."
Some English words now in general use, such as "hijacking, disc jockey, boost, bulldoze" and "jazz," originated as American slang.
Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are "get the hang of, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, stiff upper lip, bad hair day, throw a monkey wrench, under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over, what goes around comes around," and "will the real x please stand up?" Morphology.
American English has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs.
Examples of verbed nouns are "interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service" (as a car), "corner, torch, exit" (as in "exit the lobby"), "factor" (in mathematics), "gun" ("shoot"), "author" (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, "proposition, graft" (bribery), "bad-mouth, vacation, major, backpack, backtrack, intern, ticket" (traffic violations), "hassle, blacktop, peer-review, dope" and "OD", and, of course "verbed" as used at the start of this sentence.
Compounds coined in the U.S. are for instance "foothill, flatlands, badlands, landslide" (in all senses), "overview" (the noun), ", teenager, brainstorm, , hitchhike, smalltime, , frontman, lowbrow" and "highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face" (later verbed), "upfront" (in all senses), "fixer-upper, no-show;" many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: "non-profit, for-profit, free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;" many compound nouns and adjectives are open: "happy hour, fall guy, capital gain, road trip, wheat pit, head start, plea bargain;" some of these are colorful "(empty nester, loan shark, , buzz saw, ghetto blaster, dust bunny)," others are euphemistic "(differently abled (physically challenged), human resources, affirmative action, correctional facility)."
Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: ", stopover, lineup, , tryout, spin-off, rundown" ("summary"), "shootout, holdup, hideout, comeback, cookout, kickback, makeover, takeover, rollback" ("decrease"), "rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up" ("stoppage"), "stand-in."
These essentially are nouned phrasal verbs; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin "(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in" and "check out" (in all senses), "fill in" ("inform"), "kick in" or "throw in" ("contribute"), "square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off" (from employment), "run into" and "across" ("meet"), "stop by, pass up, put up" (money), "set up" ("frame"), "trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out)."
Noun endings such as "-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)" and "-cian (beautician)" are also particularly productive.
Some verbs ending in "-ize" are of U.S. origin; for example, "fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, weatherize, winterize, Mirandize;" and so are some back-formations "(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve" and "enthuse)."
Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are "as of" (with dates and times), "outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to" and "lack for."
Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably "pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry" (as in "pry open", from "prize), putter" (verb), "buddy, sundae, skeeter, sashay" and "kitty-corner."
Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, "lengthy, bossy, cute" and "cutesy, grounded" (of a child), "punk" (in all senses), "sticky" (of the weather), "through" (as in "through train", or meaning "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as "peppy" or "wacky".
American blends include "motel, guesstimate, infomercial" and "televangelist."
English words that survived in the United States and not in the United Kingdom.
A number of words and meanings that originated in Middle English or Early Modern English and that have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in Lowland Scots.
Terms such as "fall" ("autumn"), "faucet" ("tap"), "diaper" ("nappy"), "candy" ("sweets"), "skillet", "eyeglasses" and "obligate" are often regarded as Americanisms.
"Fall" for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year".
During the 17th century, English immigration to the British colonies in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them.
While the term "fall" gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America.
"Gotten" (past participle of "get") is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of Britain, such as Lancashire and North East England, that still continue to use it and sometimes also use "putten" as the past participle for "put" (which is not done by most speakers of American English).
Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include "hire" ("to employ"), "quit" ("to stop", which spawned "quitter" in the U.S.), "I guess" (famously criticized by  <START:person> H. W. Fowler <END> ), "baggage", "hit" (a place), and the adverbs "overly" and "presently" ("currently").
Some of these, for example "monkey wrench" and "wastebasket", originated in 19th century Britain.
The mandative subjunctive (as in "the City Attorney suggested that the case "not be closed"") is livelier in American English than it is in British English.
It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal.
The adjectives "mad" meaning "angry", "smart" meaning "intelligent", and "sick" meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English.
Regionally distinct English words within the United States.
Linguist  <START:person> Bert Vaux <END>  created a survey polling English speakers across the United States about the specific words they use for a variety of given definitions.
This 2003 study concludes that: Regional differences.
While written American English is (in general) standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary.
"General American" is the name given to any American accent that is often considered relatively free of noticeable regional influences.
Eastern seaboard.
After the Civil War, the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, (koineization) so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the Eastern seaboard.
The Connecticut River and Long Island Sound is usually regarded as the southern/western extent of New England speech, which has its roots in the speech of the Puritans from East Anglia who settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
The Potomac River generally divides a group of Northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the Coastal Southern dialect area; in between these two rivers several local variations exist, chief among them the one that prevails in and around New York City and northern New Jersey, which developed on a Dutch substratum after the English conquered New Amsterdam.
The main features of Coastal Southern speech can be traced to the speech of the English from the West Country who settled in Virginia after leaving England at the time of the English Civil War.
Midwest.
A distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between Canada and the United States, centered on the Great Lakes region (but only on the American side).
This is the Inland North Dialect—the "standard Midwestern" speech that was the basis for General American in the mid-20th century (although it has been recently modified by the northern cities vowel shift).
Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both collectively as "Midwestern" in the Mid-Atlantic region or "Northern" in the Southern US.
The so-called '"Minnesotan" dialect is also prevalent in the cultural Upper Midwest, and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (like "yah" for yes, pronounced similarly to "ja" in German, Norwegian and Swedish).
In parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio, another dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch English is also spoken.
Interior.
In the interior, the situation is very different.
West of the Appalachian Mountains begins the broad zone of what is generally called "Midland" speech.
This is divided into two discrete subdivisions, the North Midland that begins north of the Ohio River valley area, and the South Midland speech; sometimes the former is designated simply "Midland" and the latter is reckoned as "Highland Southern".
The North Midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related Western dialect which contains Pacific Northwest English as well as California English, although in the immediate San Francisco area some older speakers do not possess the cot–caught merger and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which reflects a historical Mid-Atlantic heritage.
The South Midland or Highland Southern dialect follows the Ohio River in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across Arkansas and Oklahoma west of the Mississippi, and peters out in West Texas.
It is a version of the Midland speech that has assimilated some coastal Southern forms (outsiders often mistakenly believe South Midland speech and coastal South speech to be the same).
Although no longer region-specific, African American Vernacular English, which remains prevalent among African Americans, has a close relationship to Southern varieties of American English and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans.
The island state of Hawaii has a distinctive Hawaiian Pidgin.
Finally, dialect development in the United States has been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Charleston, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which imposed their marks on the surrounding areas.
Differences between British and American English.
American English and British English (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, "An American Dictionary of the English Language", was written by  <START:person> Noah Webster <END>  in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.
Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and normally do not affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some verbal auxiliaries; formal (rather than notional) agreement with collective nouns; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: "learned"/"learnt", "burned"/"burnt", "snuck/sneaked", "dove/dived") although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE "in school," BrE "at school"); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE "to the hospital", BrE "to hospital"; contrast, however, AmE "actress  <START:person> Elizabeth Taylor <END> ", BrE "the actress  <START:person> Elizabeth Taylor <END> ").
Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other, and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.
Differences in orthography are also minor.
The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as "flavor" for British "flavour", "fiber" for "fibre", "defense" for "defence", "analyze" for "analyse", "catalog" for "catalogue" and "traveling" for "travelling".
 <START:person> Noah Webster <END>  popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them.
Rather, "he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology".
Other differences are due to the francophile tastes of 19th century Victorian England (for example they preferred "programme" for "program", "manoeuvre" for "maneuver", "cheque" for "check", etc.).
AmE almost always uses "-ize" in words like "realize".
BrE prefers "-ise", but also uses "-ize" (see Oxford spelling).
There are a few differences in punctuation rules.
British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called "comma splices" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside.
American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.
AmE sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE "transportation" and BrE "transport" or where the British form is a back-formation, such as AmE "burglarize" and BrE "burgle" (from "burglar").
However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.
Apollo 14  Apollo 14 was the eighth manned mission in the United States Apollo program, and the third to land on the Moon.
It was the last of the "H missions," targeted landings with two-day stays on the Moon with two lunar EVAs, or moonwalks.
Commander  <START:person> Alan Shepard <END> , Command Module Pilot  <START:person> Stuart Roosa <END> , and Lunar Module Pilot  <START:person> Edgar Mitchell <END>  launched on their nine-day mission on January 31, 1971 at 4:04:02 pm local time after a 40-minute, 2 second delay due to launch site weather restrictions, the first such delay in the Apollo program.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  made their lunar landing on February 5 in the Fra Mauro formation; this had originally been the target of the aborted Apollo 13 mission.
During the two lunar EVAs, 42 kg of Moon rocks were collected and several surface experiments, including seismic studies, were performed.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  famously hit two golf balls on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought from Earth.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  spent about 33 hours on the Moon, with about 9½ hours on EVA.
In the aftermath of Apollo 13, several modifications were made to the service module to prevent a repeat of that accident, including improved wiring insulation and a third oxygen tank.
While  <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  were on the surface,  <START:person> Roosa <END>  remained in lunar orbit aboard the Command/Service Module "Kitty Hawk", performing scientific experiments and photographing the Moon, including the landing site of the future Apollo 16 mission.
He took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were germinated on return, resulting in the so-called Moon trees.
 <START:person> Shepard <END> ,  <START:person> Roosa <END> , and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  landed in the Pacific Ocean on February 9. Crew.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  was the oldest U.S. astronaut when he made his trip aboard Apollo 14.
He is the only astronaut from Project Mercury (the original Mercury Seven astronauts) to reach the Moon.
Another of the original seven,  <START:person> Gordon Cooper <END> , had (as Apollo 10's backup commander) tentatively been scheduled to command the mission, but according to author  <START:person> Andrew Chaikin <END> , his casual attitude toward training, along with problems with NASA hierarchy (reaching all the way back to the Mercury-Atlas 9 flight), resulted in his removal.
The mission was a personal triumph for  <START:person> Shepard <END> , who had battled back from  <START:person> Ménière <END> 's disease which grounded him from 1964 to 1968.
He and his crew were originally scheduled to fly on Apollo 13, but in 1969 NASA officials switched the scheduled crews for Apollos 13 and 14.
This was done to allow  <START:person> Shepard <END>  more time to train for his flight, as he had been grounded for four years.
As of 2015,  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  is the only surviving member of the crew;  <START:person> Roosa <END>  died in 1994 from pancreatitis and  <START:person> Shepard <END>  in 1998 from leukemia.
Mission highlights.
Launch and flight to lunar orbit.
Apollo 14 launched during heavy cloud cover and the Saturn V booster quickly disappeared from view.
However, NASA's long-range cameras, based 60 miles south in Vero Beach, had a clear shot of the remainder of the launch.
Following the launch, the Launch Control Center at Kennedy Space Center was visited by U.S. Vice President  <START:person> Spiro T. Agnew <END> , Prince  <START:person> Juan Carlos <END>  of Spain, and his wife, Princess  <START:person> Sofía <END> .
At the beginning of the mission, the CSM "Kitty Hawk" had difficulty achieving capture and docking with the LM "Antares".
Repeated attempts to dock went on for 1 hour and 42 minutes, until it was suggested that  <START:person> Roosa <END>  hold "Kitty Hawk" against "Antares" using its thrusters, then the docking probe would be retracted out of the way, hopefully triggering the docking latches.
This attempt was successful, and no further docking problems were encountered during the mission.
Lunar descent.
After separating from the Command Module in lunar orbit, the LM "Antares" also had two serious problems.
First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from a faulty switch.
NASA believed that the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of solder had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit.
The immediate solution—tapping on the panel next to the switch—did work briefly, but the circuit soon closed again.
If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the ascent stage to separate from the descent stage and climb back into orbit.
NASA and the software teams at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scrambled to find a solution, and determined the fix would involve reprogramming the flight software to ignore the false signal.
The software modifications were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time.
A second problem occurred during the powered descent, when the LM landing radar failed to lock automatically onto the  <START:person> Moon <END> 's surface, depriving the navigation computer of vital information on the vehicle's altitude and vertical descent speed (this was not a result of the modifications to the ABORT command; rather, the post-mission report indicated it was an unrelated bug in the radar's operation).
After the astronauts cycled the landing radar breaker, the unit successfully acquired a signal near 18000 ft, again just in the nick of time.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  then manually landed the LM closer to its intended target than any of the other six Moon landing missions.
 <START:person> Mitchell <END>  believes that  <START:person> Shepard <END>  would have continued with the landing attempt without the radar, using the LM inertial guidance system and visual cues.
But a post-flight review of the descent data showed the inertial system alone would have been inadequate, and the astronauts probably would have been forced to abort the landing as they approached the surface.
Lunar surface operations.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  named their landing site "Fra Mauro Base", and this designation is recognized by the International Astronomical Union (depicted in Latin on lunar maps as "Statio Fra Mauro").
 <START:person> Shepard <END> 's first words, after stepping onto the lunar surface were, "And it's been a long way, but we're here."
Unlike  <START:person> Neil Armstrong <END>  on Apollo 11 and  <START:person> Pete Conrad <END>  on Apollo 12,  <START:person> Shepard <END>  had already stepped off the LM footpad and was a few yards (meters) away before he spoke.
 <START:person> Shepard <END> 's moonwalking suit was the first to utilize red stripes on the arms and legs and on the top of the lunar EVA sunshade "hood," so as to allow easy identification between the commander and LM pilot on the surface; on the Apollo 12 pictures, it had been almost impossible to distinguish between the two crewmen, causing a great deal of confusion.
This feature was included on  <START:person> Jim Lovell <END> 's Apollo 13 suit; however, because no landing was made on that mission, Apollo 14 was the first to make use of it.
This feature was used for the remaining Apollo missions, and for the EVAs of Space Shuttle flights afterwards, and it is still in use today on both the U.S. and Russian space suits on the International Space Station.
After landing in the Fra Mauro formation—the destination for Apollo 13— <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  took two moonwalks, adding new seismic studies to the by now familiar Apollo experiment package (ALSEP), and using the Modular Equipment Transporter (MET), a pull cart for carrying equipment and samples, referred to as a "lunar rickshaw."
 <START:person> Roosa <END> , meanwhile, took pictures from on board Command Module "Kitty Hawk" in lunar orbit.
The second moonwalk, or EVA, was intended to reach the rim of the 1000 ft wide Cone Crater.
However, the two astronauts were not able to find the rim amid the rolling terrain of the crater's slopes.
They became physically exhausted from the attempt and with their suits' oxygen supplies starting to run low, the effort was called off.
Later analysis, using the pictures that they took, determined that they had come within an estimated 65 ft of the crater's rim.
Images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) show the tracks of the astronauts and the MET come to within 30 m of the rim.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  deployed and activated various scientific instruments and experiments and collected almost 100 lb of lunar samples for return to Earth.
Other Apollo 14 achievements included: the only use of MET; longest distance traversed by foot on the lunar surface; first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; and the first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.
The astronauts also engaged in less serious activities on the Moon.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  brought along a six iron golf club head which he could attach to the handle of a lunar excavation tool, and two golf balls, and took several one-handed swings (due to the limited flexibility of the EVA suit).
He exuberantly exclaimed that the second ball went "miles and miles and miles" in the low lunar gravity, but later estimated the distance as 200 to.
 <START:person> Mitchell <END>  then threw a lunar scoop handle as if it were a javelin.
Return, splashdown and quarantine.
On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space.
The Command Module "Kitty Hawk" splashed down in the South Pacific Ocean on February 9, 1971 at 21:05 [UTC], approximately 760 nmi south of American Samoa.
After recovery by the ship USS "New Orleans", the crew was flown to Pago Pago International Airport in Tafuna for a reception before being flown on a C-141 cargo plane to Honolulu.
The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be quarantined on their return from the Moon.
 <START:person> Roosa <END> , who worked in forestry in his youth, took several hundred tree seeds on the flight.
These were germinated after the return to Earth, and widely distributed around the world as commemorative Moon trees.
Mission insignia.
The oval insignia shows a gold NASA Astronaut Pin, given to U.S. astronauts upon completing their first space flight, traveling from the Earth to the Moon.
A gold band around the edge includes the mission and astronaut names.
The designer was  <START:person> Jean Beaulieu <END> .
The backup crew spoofed the patch with its own version, with revised artwork showing a  <START:person> Wile E. Coyote <END>  cartoon character depicted as gray-bearded (for  <START:person> Shepard <END> , who was 47 at the time of the mission and the oldest man on the Moon), pot-bellied (for  <START:person> Mitchell <END> , who had a pudgy appearance) and red furred (for  <START:person> Roosa <END> 's red hair), still on the way to the Moon, while Road Runner (for the backup crew) is already on the Moon, holding a U.S. flag and a flag labeled "1st Team."
The flight name is replaced by "BEEP BEEP" and the backup crew's names are given.
Several of these patches were hidden by the backup crew and found during the flight by the crew in notebooks and storage lockers in both the CSM "Kitty Hawk" and the LM "Antares" spacecraft, and one patch was even stored on the MET lunar hand cart.
Spacecraft location.
The Apollo 14 Command Module "Kitty Hawk" is on display at the Apollo/Saturn V Center building at the Kennedy Space Center after being on display at the Astronaut Hall of Fame near Titusville, Florida, for several years.
The ascent stage of Lunar Module "Antares" impacted the Moon on February 7, 1971 at 00:45:25.7 UT (February 6, 7:45 PM EST) .
"Antares"' descent stage and the mission's other equipment remain at Fra Mauro at .
Photographs taken in 2009 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter were released on July 17, and the Fra Mauro equipment was the most visible Apollo hardware at that time, owing to particularly good lighting conditions.
In 2011, the LRO returned to the landing site at a lower altitude to take higher resolution photographs.

NASA reports Multimedia  A. J. Ayer  Sir  <START:person> Alfred Jules <END>  "Freddie" Ayer (; 29 October 1910 – 27 June 1989) was a British philosopher known for his promotion of logical positivism, particularly in his books "Language, Truth, and Logic" (1936) and "The Problem of Knowledge" (1956).
He was educated at Eton College and Oxford University, after which he studied the philosophy of Logical Positivism at the University of Vienna.
From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at Christ Church College, Oxford.
During the Second World War Ayer was a Special Operations Executive and MI6 agent.
He was Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become Wykeham Professor of Logic.
He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1951 to 1952 and knighted in 1970.
Early life.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was born in St John's Wood, in north west London, to a wealthy family from continental Europe.
His mother,  <START:person> Reine Citroën <END> , was from the Dutch Jewish family who founded the Citroën car company in France.
His father,  <START:person> Jules Ayer <END> , was a Swiss Calvinist financier who worked for the  <START:person> Rothschild <END>  family.
Education.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was educated at Ascham St Vincent's School, a former boarding preparatory school for boys in the seaside town of Eastbourne in Sussex, in which he started boarding at the comparatively early age of seven, due to the First World War, and Eton College, a boarding school in Eton (near Windsor) in Berkshire.
It was at Eton that  <START:person> Ayer <END>  first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity.
Although primarily interested in furthering his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the Eton Wall Game very well.
In the final examinations at Eton,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  came second in his year, and first in classics.
In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of corporal punishment at the school.
He won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.
Life and career.
After graduation from Oxford University Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, "Language, Truth and Logic" in 1936.
The first exposition in English of Logical Positivism as newly developed by the Vienna Circle, this made Ayer at age 26 the 'enfant terrible' of British philosophy.
In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and MI6).
After the war he briefly returned to Oxford University where he became a fellow and Dean of Wadham College.
He thereafter taught philosophy at London University from 1946 until 1959, when he also started to appear on radio and television.
He was an extrovert, and social mixer, and was married four times, including to  <START:person> Dee Wells <END>  and  <START:person> Vanessa Salmon <END>  (thus becoming stepfather to  <START:person> Nigella Lawson <END> ).
Reputedly he liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York.
He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of the Tottenham Hotspur football team.
For an academic,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high society' and the establishment.
Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.
Philosophical ideas.
In Language, Truth and Logic (1936),  <START:person> Ayer <END>  asserts the verification principle as the only valid basis for philosophy.
Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like "God exists" or "charity is good" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored.
Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense.
He also criticises  <START:person> C. A. Mace <END> 's opinion that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry.
The stance of a person who believes "God" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as igtheism (for example, by  <START:person> Paul Kurtz <END> ).
In later years  <START:person> Ayer <END>  reiterated that he did not believe in God and began to refer to himself as an atheist.
He followed in the footsteps of  <START:person> Bertrand Russell <END>  by debating with the Jesuit scholar  <START:person> Frederick Copleston <END>  on the topic of religion.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's version of emotivism divides "the ordinary system of ethics" into four classes: He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in normative ethics as opposed to meta-ethics) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.
While class three statements were irrelevant to Ayer's brand of emotivism, they would later play a significant role in  <START:person> Stevenson <END> 's.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with ethical intuitionists.
But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition as "worthless" for determining moral truths, since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another.
Instead,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  concludes that ethical concepts are "mere pseudo-concepts": The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content.
Thus if I say to someone, "You acted wrongly in stealing that money," I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, "You stole that money."
In adding that this action is wrong I am not making any further statement about it.
I am simply evincing my moral disapproval of it.
It is as if I had said, "You stole that money," in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the addition of some special exclamation marks.
… If now I generalise my previous statement and say, "Stealing money is wrong," I produce a sentence that has no factual meaning—that is, expresses no proposition that can be either true or false.
… I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments.
Between 1945 and 1947, together with  <START:person> Russell <END>  and  <START:person> George Orwell <END> , he contributed a series of articles to "Polemic", a short-lived British "Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics" edited by the ex-Communist  <START:person> Humphrey Slater <END> .
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was closely associated with the British humanist movement.
He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1947 until his death.
He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.
In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded  <START:person> Julian Huxley <END>  as president of the British Humanist Association, a post he held until 1970.
In 1968 he edited "The Humanist Outlook", a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism.
In addition he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.
He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at Bard College in the fall of 1987.
At a party that same year held by fashion designer  <START:person> Fernando Sanchez <END> ,  <START:person> Ayer <END> , then 77, confronted  <START:person> Mike Tyson <END>  who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model  <START:person> Naomi Campbell <END> .
When  <START:person> Ayer <END>  demanded that  <START:person> Tyson <END>  stop, the boxer said: "Do you know who the fuck I am?
I'm the heavyweight champion of the world," to which  <START:person> Ayer <END>  replied: "And I am the former Wykeham Professor of Logic.
We are both pre-eminent in our field.
I suggest that we talk about this like rational men".
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  and  <START:person> Tyson <END>  then began to talk, while  <START:person> Naomi Campbell <END>  slipped out.
Later career.
From 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir  <START:person> Alfred <END>  held the Wykham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford.
He was knighted in 1970.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  died on 27 June 1989.
From 1980 – 1989,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  lived at 51 York Street, Marylebone, where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.
Personal life.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was married four times to three women.
His first marriage was from 1932–1941 to (Grace Isabel)  <START:person> Renée <END>  (d.
1980), who subsequently married philosopher  <START:person> Stuart Hampshire <END> ,  <START:person> Ayer <END> 's friend and colleague.
In 1960 he married  <START:person> Alberta Constance <END>  (Dee) Wells (1925–2003), with whom he had one son.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's marriage to  <START:person> Wells <END>  was dissolved in 1983 and that same year he married  <START:person> Vanessa Salmon <END> , former wife of politician  <START:person> Nigel Lawson <END> .
She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried  <START:person> Dee Wells <END> , who survived him.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist  <START:person> Sheilah Graham Westbrook <END> .
Near-death experience.
In 1988, shortly before his death,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  wrote an article entitled, "What I saw when I was dead", describing an unusual near-death experience.
Of the experience,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  first said that it "slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be."
However, a few days later he revised this, saying "what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief".
In 2001 Dr  <START:person> Jeremy George <END> , the attending physician, claimed that  <START:person> Ayer <END>  had confided to him: "I saw a Divine Being.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions."
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's son  <START:person> Nick <END> , however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.
Works.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  is best known for popularising the verification principle, in particular through his presentation of it in "Language, Truth, and Logic" (1936).
The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called Vienna Circle which  <START:person> Ayer <END>  visited as a young guest.
Others, including the leading light of the circle,  <START:person> Moritz Schlick <END> , were already offering their own papers on the issue.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable empirical import, otherwise it is either "analytical" if tautologous, or "metaphysical" (i.e.
meaningless, or "literally senseless").
He started to work on the book at the age of 23 and it was published when he was 26.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and  <START:person> David Hume <END> .
His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes "Language, Truth and Logic" essential reading on the tenets of logical empiricism– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century analytic philosophy, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world.
In it,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour', an argument which anticipates the Turing test published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  wrote two books on the philosopher  <START:person> Bertrand Russell <END> , " <START:person> Russell <END>  and  <START:person> Moore <END> : The Analytic Heritage" (1971) and "Russell" (1972).
He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of  <START:person> David Hume <END>  and a short biography of  <START:person> Voltaire <END> .
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was strong critic of the German philosopher  <START:person> Martin Heidegger <END> .
As a logical positivist  <START:person> Ayer <END>  was in conflict with  <START:person> Heidegger <END> 's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence.
These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis.
This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought.
He considered  <START:person> Heidegger <END>  to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.
In 1972–1973  <START:person> Ayer <END>  gave the Gifford Lectures at University of St Andrews, later published as "The Central Questions of Philosophy".
In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord  <START:person> Gifford <END>  wished to promote '"Natural Theology", in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are "able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth".
He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called "philosophy"– including the whole of metaphysics, theology and aesthetics– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.
In "The Concept of a Person and Other Essays" (1963),  <START:person> Ayer <END>  heavily criticized  <START:person> Wittgenstein <END> 's private language argument.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's sense-data theory in "Foundations of Empirical Knowledge" was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian  <START:person> J. L. Austin <END>  in "Sense and Sensibilia", a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  responded to this in the essay "Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?", which can be found in his "Metaphysics and Common Sense" (1969).
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci  Amerigo Vespucci <END>  (]; March 9, 1454 – February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus' voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to Afro-Eurasians.
Colloquially referred to as the New World, this second super continent came to be termed "America", deriving its name from Americus, the Latin version of  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's first name.
Background.
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  was born and raised in Florence, Italy.
He was the third son of  <START:person> Ser Nastagio <END>  ( <START:person> Anastasio <END> ), a Florentine notary, and Lisabetta Mini.
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  was educated by his uncle,  <START:person> Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci <END> , a Dominican friar of the monastery of San Marco in Florence.
While his elder brothers were sent to the University of Pisa to pursue scholarly careers,  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial house of Medici, headed by  <START:person> Lorenzo <END>  de' Medici.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  acquired the favor and protection of  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici <END>  who became the head of the business after the elder  <START:person> Lorenzo <END> 's death in 1492.
In March 1492, the  <START:person> Medici <END>  dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  and  <START:person> Donato Niccolini <END>  as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in Cádiz (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.
In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop  <START:person> Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca <END> , the Crown of Castile broke their monopoly deal with  <START:person> Christopher Columbus <END>  and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the West Indies.
Just around this time (1495–96),  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was engaged as the executor of  <START:person> Giannotto Berardi <END> , an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  organized the fulfillment of  <START:person> Berardi <END> 's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.
After these were delivered,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.
Expeditions.
At the invitation of king  <START:person> Manuel <END>  I of Portugal,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of South America between 1499 and 1502.
On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.
The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  were published between 1502 and 1504.
In 1507,  <START:person> Martin Waldseemüller <END>  produced a world map on which he named the new continent America after the feminine Latin version of  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's first name, which is Americus.
In an accompanying book,  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was trying to upset  <START:person> Christopher Columbus <END> ' glory.
However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the Soderini Letter, could be fabrications, not by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , but by others.
Historical role.
In 1508 the position of chief of navigation of Spain ("piloto mayor de Indias") was created for  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.
Two letters attributed to  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  were published during his lifetime.
"Mundus Novus" (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from Lisbon to  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco <END>  de' Medici.
It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502.
"Mundus Novus" was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.
"Lettera di  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi" (Letter of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as "Lettera al Soderini" or just "Lettera", was a letter in Italian addressed to  <START:person> Piero Soderini <END> .
Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  between 1497 and 1504.
A Latin translation was published by the German  <START:person> Martin Waldseemüller <END>  in 1507 in "Cosmographiae Introductio", a book on cosmography and geography, as "Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes" (Four Voyages of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END> ).
On March 22, 1508, King  <START:person> Ferdinand <END>  made  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).
In the 18th century three unpublished familiar letters from  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered.
One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the "four voyages".
Another was written from Cape Verde in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic.
The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.
Some have suggested that  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications.
However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> .
It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  to name the new continent America on his world map of 1507 in  <START:person> Lorraine <END> .
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  used a Latinised form of his name,  <START:person> Americus Vespucius <END> , in his Latin writings, which  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form "America", according to the prevalent view (for other hypotheses, see the footnote in the introduction).
The book accompanying the map stated: "I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women".
It is possible that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was not aware that  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  had named the continent after him.
The two disputed letters claim that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources.
At the moment there is a dispute between historians on when  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  visited the mainland the first time.
Some historians like  <START:person> Germán Arciniegas <END>  and  <START:person> Gabriel Camargo Pérez <END>  think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries.
From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication.
Voyages.
The first and fourth voyages are disputed to have occurred, while the second and third are certain voyages.
First voyage.
A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , written to  <START:person> Soderini <END> , of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498.
However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.
Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of hammocks and sweat lodges.
The names of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END> 's ships were the San Antiago, Repertaga, Wegiz, and the Girmand.
Second voyage.
About 1499–1500,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with  <START:person> Alonso de Ojeda <END>  (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander.
The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the Indian Ocean.
After hitting land at the coast of what is now Guyana, the two seem to have separated.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the Amazon River and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing Trinidad and the Orinoco River and returning to Spain by way of  <START:person> Hispaniola <END> .
The letter, to  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici <END> , claims that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  determined his longitude celestially on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage.
However, that claim may be fraudulent, which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.
Third voyage.
The last certain voyage of  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was led by  <START:person> Gonçalo Coelho <END>  in 1501–1502 in the service of Portugal.
Departing from Lisbon, the fleet sailed first to Cape Verde where they met two of  <START:person> Pedro Álvares Cabral <END> 's ships returning from India.
In a letter from Cape Verde,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  says that he hopes to visit the same lands that  <START:person> Álvares Cabral <END>  had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage.
On reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed south along the coast of South America to Rio de Janeiro's bay.
If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of Patagonia before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the Río de la Plata, which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south.
Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of  <START:person> Coelho <END>  and  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , do not show any land south of present-day Cananéia at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.
After the first half of the expedition,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  mapped Alpha and Beta Centauri, as well as the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross.
Although these stars had been known to the ancient Greeks, gradual precession had lowered them below the European horizon so that they had been forgotten.
On his return to Lisbon,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  or  <START:person> Marco Polo <END>  and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.
Fourth voyage.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504.
Like his alleged first voyage,  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place.
The only source of information for the last voyage is the "Letter to Soderini", but as several modern scholars dispute  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  undertook this trip.[b]
However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain  <START:person> Gonçalo Coelho <END> , very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition ( <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  went on board this one as well.
However, it is not independently confirmed  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.
The letters caused controversy after  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed  <START:person> Columbus <END> ' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's reputation.
Personal.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was a cousin of the husband of  <START:person> Simonetta Vespucci <END> .
He married  <START:person> Maria Cerezo <END> .
One of the very few references to  <START:person> Amerigo <END> 's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512 giving his widow,  <START:person> Maria Cerezo <END>  a lifetime pension of ten thousand marvedis per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.
Final years.
Not long after his return to Spain,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  became a Spanish citizen.
On March 22, 1508 he was made the pilot major of Spain by  <START:person> Ferdinand II of Aragon <END>  in honor of his discoveries.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  also ran a school for navigators.
He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in Seville, Spain and was buried at  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  family burial place in Florence, Italy.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt  Johann Adam Weishaupt <END>  (6 February 1748 – 18 November 1830) was a German philosopher and founder of the Order of the Illuminati, a secret society.
Early life.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  was born on 6 February 1748 in Ingolstadt in the Electorate of Bavaria.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's father  <START:person> Johann Georg Weishaupt <END>  (1717–1753) died when  <START:person> Adam <END>  was five years old.
After his father's death he came under the tutelage of his godfather  <START:person> Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt <END>  who, like his father, was a professor of law at the University of Ingolstadt.
 <START:person> Ickstatt <END>  was a proponent of the philosophy of Christian  <START:person> Wolff <END>  and of the Enlightenment, and he influenced the young  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  with his rationalism.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  began his formal education at age seven at a Jesuit school.
He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768 at age 20 with a doctorate of law.
In 1772 he became a professor of law.
The following year he married  <START:person> Afra Sausenhofer <END>  of  <START:person> Eichstätt <END> .
After  <START:person> Pope Clement XIV <END> ’s suppression of the Society of  <START:person> Jesus <END>  in 1773,  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  became a professor of canon law, a position that was held exclusively by the Jesuits until that time.
In 1775  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was introduced to the empirical philosophy of  <START:person> Johann Georg Heinrich Feder <END>  of the University of Göttingen.
Both  <START:person> Feder <END>  and  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  would later become opponents of Kantian idealism.
Founder of the Illuminati.
At a time, however, when there was no end of making game of and abusing secret societies, I planned to make use of this human foible for a real and worthy goal, for the benefit of people.
I wished to do what the heads of the ecclesiastical and secular authorities ought to have done by virtue of their offices ... On May day 1776  <START:person> Johann Adam Weishaupt <END>  founded the "Illuminati" in the Electorate of Bavaria.
He adopted the name of "Brother Spartacus" within the order.
Even Encyclopedia references vary on the goal of the order, such as New Advent saying the Order was not egalitarian or democratic internally, and sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society; while others like  <START:person> Collier <END> 's have said the aim was to combat religion and foster rationalism in its place.
The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies.
Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know: a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was initiated into the Masonic Lodge "Theodor zum guten Rath", at Munich in 1777.
His project of "illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice" was an unwelcome reform.
He used Freemasonry to recruit for his own quasi-masonic society, with the goal of "perfecting human nature" through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion.
Presenting their own system as pure masonry,  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  and  <START:person> Adolph Freiherr Knigge <END> , who organised his ritual structure, greatly expanded the secret organisation.
Contrary to  <START:person> Immanuel Kant <END> 's famous dictum that Enlightenment (and  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order was in some respects an expression of the Enlightenment Movement) was the passage by man out of his 'self-imposed immaturity' through daring to 'make use of his own reason, without the guidance of another,'  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order of Illuminati prescribed in great detail everything which the members had obediently to read and think, so that Dr.  <START:person> Wolfgang Riedel <END>  has commented that this approach to illumination or enlightenment constituted a degradation and twisting of the Kantian principle of Enlightenment.
 <START:person> Riedel <END>  writes: 'The independence of thought and judgement required by Kant ... was specifically prevented by the Order of the Illuminati's rules and regulations.
Enlightenment takes place here, if it takes place at all, precisely "under" the direction of another, namely under that of the "Superiors" [of the Order].
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's radical rationalism and vocabulary was not likely to succeed.
Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of  <START:person> Karl Theodor <END> , Elector of Bavaria, in 1784.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria.
Activities in exile.
He received the assistance of  <START:person> Duke Ernest II <END>  of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1745–1804), and lived in Gotha writing a series of works on illuminism, including "A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria" (1785), "A Picture of Illuminism" (1786), "An Apology for the Illuminati" (1786), and "An Improved System of Illuminism" (1787).
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  died in Gotha on 18 November 1830.
He was survived by his second wife,  <START:person> Anna Maria <END>  (née Sausenhofer), and his children  <START:person> Nanette <END> , Charlotte, Ernst,  <START:person> Karl <END> ,  <START:person> Eduard <END> , and  <START:person> Alfred <END> .
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was buried next to his son  <START:person> Wilhelm <END>  who preceded him in death in 1802.
After  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order of Illuminati was banned and its members dispersed, it left behind no enduring traces of an influence, not even on its own erstwhile members, who went on in the future to develop in quite different directions.
Assessment of character and intentions.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's character and intentions have been variously assessed: from those such as the Abbé Barruel and  <START:person> John Robison <END>  who regarded him as a 'human devil' and saw his mission as one of malevolent destructiveness, to those who view him as a humane and benign, albeit wilful, social reformer.
Writing on this topic, Dr.  <START:person> Tony Page <END>  comments: "Weishaupt’s plan was to educate Illuminati followers in the highest levels of humanity and morality (basing his teachings on the supremacy of Reason, allied with the spirit of the Golden Rule of not doing to others what one would not wish done to oneself), so that if  <START:person> Illuminati <END>  alumni subsequently attained positions of significance and power (such as in the fields of education and politics), they could exert a benevolent and uplifting influence upon society at large.
His project was utopian and naively optimistic, and he himself was certainly not without flaws of character – but neither he nor his plan was evil or violent in and of themselves.
It is one of the deplorable and tragic ironies of history that a man who tried to inculcate virtue, philanthropy, social justice and morality has become one of the great hate-figures of 21st-century ‘conspiracy’ thinking."
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  in pop culture.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is referred to repeatedly in "The Illuminatus!
Trilogy", written by  <START:person> Robert Shea <END>  and  <START:person> Robert Anton Wilson <END> , as the founder of the Illuminati and as an imposter who killed  <START:person> George Washington <END>  and took his place as the first president of the United States.
Washington's portrait on the U.S. one-dollar bill is said to actually be  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's.
Another version of  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  appears in the extensive comic book novel "Cerebus the Aardvark" by  <START:person> Dave Sim <END> , as a combination of  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  and  <START:person> George Washington <END> .
He appears primarily in the "Cerebus" and "Church & State I" volumes.
His motives are republican confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's name is one of many references made to the Illuminati and other conspiracies in the video game "Deus Ex" (2000).
The protagonist uncovers a virus engineered by the VersaLife Corporation with its molecular structure in multiples of 17 and 23.
An ally of the protagonist notes "1723.
The birth of  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END> " even though this reference is actually incorrect as  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was born in 1748.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is also mentioned (" <START:person> Bush <END>  got a ouija to talk to  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END> ") by the New York rapper  <START:person> Cage <END>  in El-P's "Accidents Don't Happen", the ninth track on his album "Fantastic Damage" (2002).
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is briefly mentioned in  <START:person> Umberto Eco <END> 's novel "The Prague Cemetery".
 <START:person> Asterix  Asterix <END>  or The Adventures of  <START:person> Asterix <END>  (French: Astérix or Astérix le Gaulois, ]) is a series of French comics.
The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine "Pilote" on 29 October 1959.
It was written by  <START:person> René Goscinny <END>  and illustrated by  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  until the death of  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  in 1977.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette.
As of 2013, 35 volumes have been released.
The series follows the exploits of a village of indomitable Gauls as they resist Roman occupation.
They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid called Getafix in the English translations, which gives the recipient superhuman strength.
The protagonist, the titular character  <START:person> Asterix <END> , along with his friend  <START:person> Obelix <END>  have various adventures.
The "ix" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish "ix" names in the series) "alludes" to the "rix" suffix (meaning "king") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as Vercingetorix, Orgetorix, and Dumnorix.
(See below for further explanations of the character names.)
Many of the stories have them travel to foreign countries, though others are set in and around their village.
For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.
The  <START:person> Asterix <END>  series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most European countries.
The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into 12 films: eight animated, and four live action.
There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris,  <START:person> Parc Astérix <END> .
To date, 325 million copies of 34 Asterix books have been sold worldwide, making co-creators  <START:person> René Goscinny <END>  and  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  France's bestselling authors abroad.
History.
Prior to creating the  <START:person> Asterix <END>  series,  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  and  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  had previously had success with their series "Oumpah-pah", which was published in "Tintin" magazine.
"Astérix" was originally serialised in "Pilote" magazine, in the very first issue published on 29 October 1959.
In 1961 the first book was put together, titled "Asterix the Gaul".
From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis.
Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000.
In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000.
A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and the Big Fight" sold 400,000 upon initial publication.
The ninth Asterix volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END> 's first sketches portrayed  <START:person> Asterix <END>  as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior.
But  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  had a different picture in his mind.
He visualized  <START:person> Asterix <END>  as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength.
However,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  agreed.
Hence,  <START:person> Obelix <END>  was born.
Despite the growing popularity of  <START:person> Asterix <END>  with the readers, the financial backing for Pilote ceased.
 <START:person> Pilote <END>  was taken over by  <START:person> Georges Dargaud <END> .
When  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  died in 1977,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue.
He continued the series but on a less frequent basis.
Most critics and fans of the series prefer  <START:person> Goscinny <END> 's albums.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  created his own publishing company, Les Editions Albert-René, which published every album drawn and written by  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  alone since then.
However,  <START:person> Dargaud <END> , the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  and  <START:person> Goscinny <END> .
In 1990, the  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  and  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  families decided to sue  <START:person> Dargaud <END>  to take over the rights.
In 1998, after a long trial,  <START:person> Dargaud <END>  lost the rights to publish and sell the albums.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  (40%),  <START:person> Sylvie Uderzo <END>  (20%) and  <START:person> Anne Goscinny <END>  (40%).
Although  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  declared he did not want anyone to continue the series after his death, which is similar to the request  <START:person> Hergé <END>  made regarding his "The Adventures of Tintin", his attitude changed and in December 2008 he sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company and now owns the rights.
In a letter published in the French newspaper "Le Monde" in 2009,  <START:person> Uderzo <END> 's daughter,  <START:person> Sylvie <END> , attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new "Astérix" adventures after his death.
She said "...the co-creator of "Astérix", France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance”.
However,  <START:person> René Goscinny <END> 's daughter  <START:person> Anne <END>  also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time.
She is reported to have said that " <START:person> Asterix <END>  has already had two lives: one during my father's lifetime and one after it.
Why not a third?".
A few months later,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  appointed three illustrators, who had been his assistants for many years, to continue the series.
In 2011,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  announced that a new  <START:person> Asterix <END>  album was due out in 2013, with  <START:person> Jean-Yves Ferri <END>  writing the story and  <START:person> Frédéric Mébarki <END>  drawing it.
A year later, in 2012, the publisher  <START:person> Albert-René <END>  announced that  <START:person> Frédéric Mébarki <END>  had withdrawn from drawing the new album, due to the pressure he felt in following in the steps of Uderzo.
Comic artist  <START:person> Didier Conrad <END>  was officially announced to take over drawing duties from Mébarki, with the due date of the new album in 2013 unchanged.
In January 2015, after the murders of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly  <START:person> Charlie Hebdo <END> , presumably for their controversial work, Astérix creator  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  came out of retirement to draw 2 Astérix pictures honoring the memories of the victims.

In 2007, Les Editions  <START:person> Albert René <END>  released a tribute volume titled "Astérix et ses Amis", a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories.
It was a tribute to  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists.
The volume was translated into nine languages.
s of 2010[ [update]], it has not been translated into English.
Synopsis and characters.
The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village in Armorica (present-day Brittany), a province of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (modern France), in the year 50 BC.
 <START:person> Julius Caesar <END>  has conquered nearly all of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  for the Roman Republic.
The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, Getafix.
His chief is  <START:person> Vitalstatistix <END> .
The main protagonist and hero of the village is  <START:person> Asterix <END> , who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village.
He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and unintelligent friend,  <START:person> Obelix <END> , who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength.
 <START:person> Obelix <END>  is usually accompanied by  <START:person> Dogmatix <END> , his little dog.
(Except for  <START:person> Asterix <END>  and  <START:person> Obelix <END> , the names of the characters change with the language.
For example,  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's dog's name is "Dogmatix" in English, but "Idéfix" in the original French edition.)
 <START:person> Asterix <END>  and  <START:person> Obelix <END>  (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands.
Places visited in the series include parts of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (Lutetia, Corsica etc.), neighbouring nations (Belgium, Spain, Britain, Germany etc.), and far away lands (North America, Middle East, India etc.).
The series employs science-fiction and fantasy elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of extraterrestrials in " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and the Falling Sky" and the city of Atlantis in " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and Obelix All at Sea".
Humour.
The humour encountered in the "Asterix" comics is often centering on puns, caricatures, and tongue-in-cheek stereotypes of contemporary European nations and French regions.
Much of the humour in the initial  <START:person> Asterix <END>  books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story.
Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's famous "Ils sont fous ces romains" ("These Romans are crazy") is translated as " <START:person> Sono <END>  pazzi questi romani", alluding to the Roman abbreviation "SPQR".
In another example: Hiccups are written onomatopoeically in French as "hips," but in English as "hic," allowing Roman legionaries in at least one of the English translations to decline their hiccups in Latin ("hic, haec, hoc").
The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.
In spite of (or perhaps because of) this stereotyping, and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French chauvinism, the humour has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world.
Character names.
All the fictional characters in Asterix have names which are puns on their roles or personalities and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality.
Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an '-ix' suffix for the males and ending in '-a' for the females, for example, Chief Vitalstatistix (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife Impedimenta (often at odds with the chief).
The male Roman names end in '-us', echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in Gluteus Maximus, a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the butt of the joke.
Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in "-ic", after Gothic chiefs such as  <START:person> Alaric <END>  and Theoderic, for example Rhetoric the interpreter.
Greek names end in "-os" or "-es"; for example, Thermos the restaurateur.
British names end in "-ax" and are often puns on the taxation associated with the later United Kingdom, such as Valuaddedtax the druid and Selectivemploymentax the mercenary.
Other nationalities are treated to Pidgin translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning eggs and bacon, is often guidebook Spanish for tourists) or literary and other popular media references, like  <START:person> Dubbelosix <END>  (a reference to  <START:person> James Bond <END> 's codename 007).
Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation, for example, the druid Getafix is "Panoramix" in the original French and "Miraculix" in German.
Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved:  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's dog, known in the original French as "Idéfix" (from "idée fixe", a "fixed idea" or obsession), is called "Dogmatix" in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely ("dogmatic") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable "Dog-" at the beginning of the name.
The name " <START:person> Asterix <END> ", French "Astérix", comes from "astérisque", meaning "asterisk", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ ("aster"), meaning a "star").
His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local alphabets.
For example, in Esperanto, Polish, Slovene, Latvian, and Turkish it is "Asteriks".
In Turkish he was first named "Bücür" meaning "shorty", but the name was then changed.
An exception is in Icelandic, in which he is known as "Ástríkur" ("Rich of love").
In Sinhalese, the name is සිංහල ("Soora Pappa"), which can be interpreted as "Hero".
For explanations of some of the other names, see List of Asterix characters.

In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the Romanesque dialect.
In former Yugoslavia, "Forum" publishing house translated Corsican in "Asterix in Corsica" into Montenegrin dialect of Serbo-Croatian (today called Montenegrin language).
In the Netherlands several volumes were translated into Frisian, a language related to English spoken in the province of Friesland.
Also in the Netherlands two volumes were translated into Limburgish, a regional language spoken not only in Dutch Limburg but also in Belgian Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Hungarian-language books have been issued in Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia.
Although not a fully autonomous dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in Hungary.
In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into Sinhala ("Singhalese") as  <START:person> Sura Pappa <END> , the only Sri Lankan translation of a foreign cartoon that managed to keep the spirit of the original series intact.
Most volumes have been translated into Latin and Ancient Greek with accompanying teachers' guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages.
English translation.
The translation of the books into English has been done by  <START:person> Derek Hockridge <END>  and  <START:person> Anthea Bell <END> , and their English language rendition has been widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French version.
Adaptations.
The series has been adapted into various media.
Films.
Various motion pictures based upon the series have been made.
Games.
Many gamebooks, board games and video games are based upon the  <START:person> Asterix <END>  series.
In particular, many video games were released by various computer game publishers.
Theme park.
 <START:person> Parc Astérix <END> , a theme park 22 miles north of Paris, based upon the series, was opened in 1989.
It is one of the most visited sites in France, with around 1.6 million visitors per year.

</dl>  Algebraic extension  In abstract algebra, a field extension "L"/"K" is called algebraic if every element of "L" is algebraic over "K", i.e. if every element of "L" is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in "K".
Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain transcendental elements, are called transcendental.
For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q(√2)/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers.
All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree.
This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic.
The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic.
For instance, the field of all algebraic numbers is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.
If "a" is algebraic over "K", then "K"["a"], the set of all polynomials in "a" with coefficients in "K", is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of "K" which has finite degree over "K".
The converse is true as well, if "K"["a"] is a field, then "a" is algebraic over "K".
In the special case where "K" = Q is the field of rational numbers, Q["a"] is an example of an algebraic number field.
A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called algebraically closed.
An example is the field of complex numbers.
Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice.
An extension "L"/"K" is algebraic if and only if every sub "K"-algebra of "L" is a field.
Properties.
The class of algebraic extensions forms a distinguished class of field extensions, that is, the following three properties hold: These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction:  This fact, together with  <START:person> Zorn <END> 's lemma (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of algebraic closures.
Generalizations.
Model theory generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of "M" into "N" is called an algebraic extension if for every "x" in "N" there is a formula "p" with parameters in "M", such that "p"("x") is true and the set is finite.
It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension.
The  <START:person> Galois <END>  group of "N" over "M" can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of  <START:person> Galois <END>  groups can be developed for the general case.
Aster CT-80  The Aster CT-80, an early (1982) home/personal computer developed by the small Dutch company MCP (later renamed to Aster Computers), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists.
Later it was sold ready to use.
It consisted of several Eurocard PCB's with DIN 41612 connectors, and a backplane all based on a 19-inch rack configuration.
It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer.
The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy TRS-80 computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run CP/M software, with a big amount of free memory Transient Program Area, (TPA) and a full 80×25 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal.
Although the Aster was a clone of the TRS-80 Model I it was in fact more compatible with the TRS-80  <START:person> Model III <END> , and ran all the software of these systems including games.
It also had a built in speaker which was compatible with such games software.
Models.
Three models were sold.
The first model (launched June 1982) looked like the later IBM PC (which came on the market years later), a rectangular base unit with two floppy drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard.
The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5¼" floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened Apple with a built-in keyboard.
All units ran much faster than the original TRS-80, at 4 MHz, (with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic), and an improved character font set.
The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 KB, more than four times the capacity of the original TRS-80.
A special version of NewDos/80, (an improved TRS-DOS compatible Disk operating system) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.
For the educational market a version of the first model was produced with a new plastic enclosure (the First Asters had an all-metal enclosure) that also had an opening on the top in which a cassette recorder could be placed.
This model was used in a cluster with one Aster (with disk drives) for the teacher, and eight disk less versions for the pupils.
The pupils could download software from the teachers computer through a network based on a fast serial connection, as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer.
There was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor.
Working modes.
The Aster used 64KB of RAM memory and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy or with a TRS-DOS floppy, the Aster would be fully TRS-80 compatible, with 48KB or RAM.
When the boot loader detected a CP/M floppy, the Aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free RAM for programs (TPA) and an 80 x 25 display.
This dual-architecture capability only existed on one other TRS-80 clone, the LOBO Max-80.
With a special configuration tool, the CT-80 could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.
A third mode was entered with a special boot floppy which turned the Aster into a Videotex terminal with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in RS232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.
Sales.
Most Aster CT-80's (about 10 thousand of them) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the "honderd scholen project" (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools.
MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands.
Another important demand was that the computers could be used in a network (Aster developed special software and hardware for that).
Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to Philips and their P2000 homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the technical demands, was made in Austria and did not have network hard nor software.
The company.
Aster computers was based in the small town of Arkel near the town of Gorinchem.
Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music.
The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time .
They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the "junior Computer" from  <START:person> Elektor <END>  (a copy of the KIM-1), and the ZX80 from  <START:person> Sinclair <END> .
Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers.
But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the WD1771 floppy disc controller chip without an external "data separator".
To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation.
Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable.
So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure.
The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64 KB RAM chips.
While this went on MCP renamed itself to "MCP CHIP" but ran into problems with the German computer magazine CHIP, and had to return to its former name.
At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the TRS-80, the Video Genie, (another TRS-80 clone), the Luxor ABC 80 and the Apple II.
They also sold the exotic Olivetti M20, a very early 16 bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a Z8000 CPU.
After designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface.
They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas.
The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low.
Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80.
So they decided to designed a TRS-80 and CP/M software compatible computer system, which (following the lead of Apple Computer) they decided to name after a "typical Dutch flower".
So they called it the Aster CT-80 (CP/M/Tandy-1980).
Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that "Aster" is also a Dutch girls name has something to do with it.
Remarkably "Aster" was also the name given to a Dutch Supercomputer much later, in 2002.
The first version of the Aster consisted of four "Eurocard's", one Z80 CPU card with 64KB memory, one Motorola MC6845 based video card, one double density floppy disk controller card and one "keyboard/RS232/cassette interface" card.
Plus a "backplane card", (which connected all the other cards) and a keyboard.
And was intended for hobbyists, to be sold as a kit consisting of the parts and the PCB's for the computer and attached keyboard.
After selling a few kits, MCP became convinced there was a much bigger market for an improved model sold as a completed working system.
However the original kit version lacked many features that prevented its use as a serious computer system.
Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, (adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80/64 column text mode support, (with different size letters for TRS-80 and CP/M mode, so that in TRS-80 mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64x16 portion of the 80x25 screen) with an improved font set (adding "gray scale" version of the TRS-80 mozaik graphics and many special PETSCII like characters), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, (in the form of a 19-inch rack for the Eurocards) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply.
A software engineer was hired to write the special "dual boot mode" BIOS and the special CP/M BIOS.
The "dual boot mode" BIOS actually discovered whether a TRS-DOS, or Aster CP/M disk was placed in the drive, and would, depending on the type of disk, reorganise the internal memory architecture of the system, to either be 100% TRS-80 compatible or optimally support CP/M, with as much "workspace" as possible, and the 80x25 video mode.
It also was responsible for switching to ROM BASIC when the system was turned on with the break key pressed, and later supported a primitive LAN system, using the RS232 port with modified cabling.
The very first of the ready made computers were sold with the "kit" versions of the euro cards, the version with redesigned cards came a month or so later.
Soon the little shop became much too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby (formerly a window glass factory), and started mass-producing the Aster for a period of a few years, in which time its staff grew twentyfold.
After the Aster having been a few years on the Market Tandy released its own improved model, the TRS-80 Model III computer which solved many of the same problems that the Aster also had solved, but the model 3 still did not fully support CP/M as the Aster did.
In the meantime IBM had released its original IBM PC, which incidentally looked remarkably like the Asters base with floppy drives + separate keyboard set-up.
The aster was chosen for Dutch schools by the Dutch ministry of education, in a set-up with eight disk-less Asters, and one Aster with high capacity floppy drives all connected by a LAN based on the Asters high-speed serial port hardware, and special cables that permitted that any single computer on the LAN could broadcast to all other computers.
The floppy based system was operated by the teacher who could send programs from his floppy disk, and data, to the student's disk-less systems thanks to the special BIOS in those systems.
The students could send programs and data back to the teacher through the same LAN, or could save to a cassette recorder built into the disk-less units.
Through a special "video-switch" the teacher was also able to see a copy of each students display on his own screen.
About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.
Unfortunately, because of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.
Perhaps the Aster computer inspired another Dutch computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower — the Tulip's Tulip System-1 which appeared about the same time Aster folded.
Most of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) MSX system for a company called "Micro Technology b.v.".
Unreleased add ons.
To enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system).
A hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a SCSI interface, and the necessary software.
A working prototype was developed that added a 40MB hard disk.
On the software front, work was being done to implement the replacement for the aging "user interface" of CP/M, (the Command Console Processor CCP ) with the more modern ZCPR.
Finally a replacement for the aging Z80 processor was being developed in the form of an Intel 8086 board, and additional 512K 16 bit memory boards.
Such replacements of CPU and memory system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that was designed to support both 8 and 16 bit processors, and used a modular Eurocard based design with slots to spare for expansion.
In theory the system could support the Z80 and the 8086 simultaneously.
Plans were formulated to support CP/M-86 and even MS-DOS.
Unfortunately none of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before any of them could be released.
Atlanta Braves  The Atlanta Braves are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team in Atlanta, Georgia, playing in the Eastern Division of the National League.
The Braves have played home games at Turner Field since 1997 and play spring training games in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.
In 2017, the team is to move to SunTrust Park, a new stadium complex in the Cumberland district of Cobb County just north of the I-285 bypass.
The "Braves" name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for a Native American warrior.
They are nicknamed "the "Bravos"", and often referred to as "America's Team" in reference to the team's games being broadcast on the nationally available TBS from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a wide fan base.
From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period (omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions).
The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and they returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010.
The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995.
Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 16 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants, and three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta.
The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities.
The club is one of the National League's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the Chicago Cubs) and was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings (not to be confused with the American League's Boston Red Sox).
They are considered "the oldest continuously playing team in major North American sports."
There is an argument as to which team is actually older, because, although the Cubs are a full season "older" (formed as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870), Chicago did not sponsor a White Stockings team for two seasons due to the Great Chicago Fire; therefore, the Braves have played more consecutive seasons.
After various name changes, the team eventually began operating as the Boston Braves, which lasted for most of the first half of the 20th century.
Then, in 1953, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves, followed by the final move to Atlanta in 1966.
The team's tenure in Atlanta is noted for  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END>  breaking  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END> 's career home run record in 1974.
History.
Boston.
1870–1913.
The Cincinnati Red Stockings, established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season.
Player-manager  <START:person> Harry Wright <END> , with brother  <START:person> George <END>  and two other Cincinnati players, then went to Boston Massachusetts at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder  <START:person> Ivers Whitney Adams <END>  to form the nucleus of the "Boston Red Stockings", a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP).
The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports.
(The only other team that has been organized as long, the Chicago Cubs, did not play for the two years following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.)
Two young players hired away from the Forest City club of Rockford, Illinois, turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher  <START:person> Al Spalding <END>  (founder of Spalding sporting goods) and second baseman  <START:person> Ross Barnes <END> .
Led by the  <START:person> Wright <END>  brothers,  <START:person> Barnes <END> , and  <START:person> Spalding <END> , the Red Stockings dominated the National Association, winning four of that league's five championships.
The team became one of the National League's charter franchises in 1876, sometimes called the "Red Caps" (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member).
Boston came to be called the "Beaneaters" in 1883, while retaining red as the team color.
The Boston Red Caps played in the first game in the history of the National League, on Saturday, April 22, 1876, defeating the Athletics, 6-5.
Although somewhat stripped of talent in the National League's inaugural year, Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants.
The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants.
For most of that time, their manager was  <START:person> Frank Selee <END> .
The 1898 team finished 102–47, a club record for wins that would stand for almost a century.
Stars of those 1890s  <START:person> Beaneater <END>  teams included the "Heavenly Twins",  <START:person> Hugh Duffy <END>  and  <START:person> Tommy McCarthy <END> , as well as "Slidin'"  <START:person> Billy Hamilton <END> .
The team was decimated when the American League's new Boston entry set up shop in 1901.
Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match.
They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913, and lost 100 games five times.
In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in "The Sporting News Baseball Guide" during the 1940s when each team's entry had a history of its nickname(s).
See details in History of baseball team nicknames).
The American League club's owner,  <START:person> Charles Taylor <END> , wasted little time in adopting Red Sox as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic "Americans").
Media-driven nickname changes to the "Doves" in 1907 and the "Rustlers" in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck.
The team became the "Braves" for the first time in 1912.
Their owner,  <START:person> James Gaffney <END> , was a member of New York City's political machine, Tammany Hall, which used an Indian chief as their symbol.
1914: Miracle.
Two years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history.
After a dismal 4–18 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last place finish.
On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Dodgers.
The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place, "15 games" behind the league-leading New York Giants, who had won the previous three league pennants.
After a day off, the Braves started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41–12.
On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three from the New York Giants and moved into first place.
The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16–16.
They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.
They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.
Despite their amazing comeback, the Braves entered the World Series as a heavy underdog to  <START:person> Connie Mack <END> 's Philadelphia A's.
Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics—the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern World Series (the 1907 Series had one tied game) to win the world championship.
Meanwhile,  <START:person> Johnny Evers <END>  won the Chalmers Award.
The Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at Fenway Park, since their normal home, the South End Grounds, was too small.
However, the Braves' success inspired owner  <START:person> Gaffney <END>  to build a modern park, Braves Field, which opened in August 1915.
It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield.
The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.
1915–1953.
After contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932.
The lone highlight of those years came when Judge  <START:person> Emil Fuchs <END>  bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great  <START:person> Christy Mathewson <END> , back into the game.
However,  <START:person> Mathewson <END>  died in 1925, leaving  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  in control of the team.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome.
The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager  <START:person> Bill McKechnie <END> , but  <START:person> Fuchs <END> ' revenue was severely depleted due to the Great Depression.
Looking for a way to get more fans and more money,  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  worked out a deal with the New York Yankees to acquire  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END> , who had started his career with the Red Sox.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  made  <START:person> Ruth <END>  team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits.
He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  even suggested that  <START:person> Ruth <END> , who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once  <START:person> McKechnie <END>  stepped down—perhaps as early as 1936.
At first, it appeared that  <START:person> Ruth <END>  was the final piece the team needed in 1935.
On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 win over the Giants.
However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500
all year.
Events went downhill quickly.
While  <START:person> Ruth <END>  could still hit, he could do little else.
He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if  <START:person> Ruth <END>  were in the lineup.
It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and  <START:person> Fuchs <END> ' promise of a share of team profits was hot air.
In fact,  <START:person> Ruth <END>  discovered that  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  expected him to invest some of "his" money in the team.
Seeing a franchise in complete disarray,  <START:person> Ruth <END>  retired on June 1—only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three home runs of his career.
He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.
The Braves finished 38–115, the worst season in franchise history.
Their .248
winning percentage is the third-worst in baseball history, and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the 1899 Cleveland Spiders).
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  lost control of the team in August 1935, and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the "Boston Bees".
This did little to change the team's fortunes.
After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate  <START:person> Lou Perini <END> , changed the nickname back to the Braves.
He immediately set about rebuilding the team.
World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of  <START:person> Warren Spahn <END>  to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.
In 1948, the team won the pennant, behind the pitching of  <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Johnny Sain <END> , who won 39 games between them.
The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, "Boston Post" writer  <START:person> Gerald Hern <END>  wrote this poem about the pair: The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as " <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Sain <END>  and pray for rain", entered the baseball vocabulary.
However, in the 1948 season, the Braves actually had the same record in games that  <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Sain <END>  started that the team had overall, in terms of winning percentage.
The 1948 World Series, which the Braves lost in six games to the Indians, turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston.
In 1950,  <START:person> Sam Jethroe <END>  became the team's first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18.
Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953,  <START:person> Perini <END> , who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to Milwaukee, where the Braves had their top farm club, the Brewers.
Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation.
 <START:person> Bill Veeck <END>  had tried to return his St. Louis Browns there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.
Milwaukee (1953–1965).
Milwaukee went wild over the Braves, who were welcomed as genuine heroes.
The Braves finished 92–62 in their first season in Milwaukee, and drew a then-NL record 1.8 million fans.
The success of the team was noted by many owners.
Not coincidentally, the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns, Brooklyn Dodgers, and New York Giants would leave their original hometowns within the next five years.
As the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive.
Sluggers  <START:person> Eddie Mathews <END>  and  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END>  drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee), while  <START:person> Warren Spahn <END> ,  <START:person> Lew Burdette <END> , and  <START:person> Bob Buhl <END>  anchored the rotation.
The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.
In 1957, the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's MVP season, as he led the National League in home runs and RBI.
Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run walk-off home run that gave the Braves a 4–2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and clinched the League championship.
The team then went on to its first World Series win in over 40 years, defeating the New York Yankees of Berra,  <START:person> Mantle <END> , and Ford in seven games.
 <START:person> Burdette <END> , the Series MVP, threw three complete game victories, giving up only two earned runs.
In 1958, the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the New York Yankees once more, thanks in part to the strength of  <START:person> Spahn <END> 's and  <START:person> Burdette <END> 's pitching.
But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP  <START:person> Bob Turley <END> 's pitching.
The 1959 season saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers, both with 86-68 records.
Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about 75 mi apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers.
The Dodgers would go on to defeat the Chicago White Sox in the World Series.
The next six years were up-and-down for the Braves.
The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by  <START:person> Burdette <END>  and  <START:person> Spahn <END> , and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, who ultimately were to win the World Series that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher  <START:person> Harvey Haddix <END> .
The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite  <START:person> Spahn <END>  recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  hit 45 home runs in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth.
The next season,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and  <START:person> Spahn <END>  was once again the ace of the staff, going 23–7.
However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the lower half of the league, or "second division", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.
The Braves were somewhat mediocre as the 1960s began, but fattened up on the expansion New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s.
To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team who played more than one season and never had a losing record.
 <START:person> Perini <END>  sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by  <START:person> William Bartholomay <END>  in 1962.
Almost immediately  <START:person> Bartholomay <END>  started shopping the Braves to a larger television market.
Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor  <START:person> Ivan Allen <END> ,  <START:person> Jr. <END>  constructed a new $18 million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, Atlanta Stadium, which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team.
After the city failed to lure the Kansas City A's to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season.
However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year.
In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.
 <START:person> Eddie Mathews <END>  is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in.
 <START:person> Mathews <END>  played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.
Atlanta.
1966–1974.
The Braves were a .500
team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85–77 in 1966, 77–85 in 1967, and 81–81 in 1968.
The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston.
In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever National League West Division title, before being swept by the "Miracle Mets" in the National League Championship Series.
They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 – in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.
In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END> .
In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium ("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production.
Atlanta also produced batting champions in  <START:person> Rico Carty <END>  (in 1970) and  <START:person> Ralph Garr <END>  (in 1974).
In the shadow of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 –  <START:person> Darrell Evans <END> ,  <START:person> Davey Johnson <END>  and, of course,  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
By the end of the 1973 season,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  had hit 713 home runs, one short of  <START:person> Ruth <END> 's record.
Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure.
The next season, it was only a matter of time before he set a new record.
On April 4, opening day, he hit No.714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience he finally beat  <START:person> Ruth <END> 's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before asking to be traded to the Milwaukee Brewers, while  <START:person> Ruth <END>  finished his career as a Boston Brave.
In fact, until  <START:person> Barry Bonds <END>  eclipsed the 714 home runs hit by  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END>  in 2006, the top two home run hitters in Major League history had at one time been Braves.
1976–77:  <START:person> Ted Turner <END>  buys the team.
In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> , owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta.
The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment.
It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
 <START:person> Turner <END>  quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner.
On May 11, 1977,  <START:person> Turner <END>  appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2–1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).
Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base.
WTBS marketed the team as "The Atlanta Braves: America's Team", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South.
Among other things, in 1976  <START:person> Turner <END>  suggested the nickname "Channel" for pitcher  <START:person> Andy Messersmith <END>  and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired Braves games.
Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.
1978–1990.
After three straight losing seasons,  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season.
He promoted 22-year-old slugger  <START:person> Dale Murphy <END>  into the starting lineup.
 <START:person> Murphy <END>  hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base.
In 1980,  <START:person> Murphy <END>  was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974.
 <START:person> Cox <END>  was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with  <START:person> Joe Torre <END> , under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969.
Strong performances from  <START:person> Bob Horner <END> ,  <START:person> Chris Chambliss <END> , pitcher  <START:person> Phil Niekro <END> , and short relief pitcher  <START:person> Gene Garber <END>  helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than  <START:person> Murphy <END> , who won both a Most Valuable Player and a Gold Glove award.
 <START:person> Murphy <END>  also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s.
 <START:person> Murphy <END> , excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990.
Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games.
The 1986 season saw the return of  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  as general manager.
Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Native American-themed mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa.
1991–2004: Division dominance.
1991–1994.
 <START:person> Cox <END>  returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing  <START:person> Russ Nixon <END> .
The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97.
They traded  <START:person> Dale Murphy <END>  to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player.
Pitching coach  <START:person> Leo Mazzone <END>  began developing young pitchers  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END> ,  <START:person> Steve Avery <END> , and  <START:person> John Smoltz <END>  into future stars.
That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB Draft to select  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END> , who became one of the best hitters in team history.
Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office.
Immediately after the season,  <START:person> John Schuerholz <END>  was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.
The following season,  <START:person> Glavine <END> ,  <START:person> Avery <END> , and  <START:person> Smoltz <END>  would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them.
Meanwhile, behind position players  <START:person> David Justice <END> ,  <START:person> Ron Gant <END>  and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion  <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END> , the Braves overcame a 39–40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races.
The "Worst to First" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag.
They defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in a very tightly contested seven-game NLCS only to lose the World Series, also in seven games, to the Minnesota Twins.
The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.
Despite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue.
In 1992, the Braves returned to the NLCS and once again defeated the Pirates in seven games, culminating in a dramatic game seven win.
 <START:person> Francisco Cabrera <END> 's two-out single that scored  <START:person> David Justice <END>  and  <START:person> Sid Bream <END>  capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3–2 victory.
It was the first time in post season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning.
The Braves lost the World Series to the Toronto Blue Jays, however.
In 1993, the Braves signed Cy Young Award winning pitcher  <START:person> Greg Maddux <END>  from the Chicago Cubs, leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball.
The 1993 team posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the San Francisco Giants, who won 103 games.
The Braves needed a stunning 55–19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11.
However, the Braves fell in the NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.
In 1994, in a realignment of the National League's divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.
This realignment was the main cause of the team's heated rivalry with the New York Mets during the mid-to-late 1990s.
The player's strike cut short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the Montreal Expos with 48 games left to play.
1995–2004.
The Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series.
This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the "Buffalo Bills of Baseball" (January 1996 issue of "Beckett Baseball Card Monthly").
With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities.
With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the 1996 and 1999 World Series (losing both to the New York Yankees, managed by  <START:person> Joe Torre <END> , a former Braves manager), and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early.
Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization —Cox was the Braves' manager, while  <START:person> Schuerholz <END>  remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president.
 <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END>  finished his playing career elsewhere, but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.
In October 1996, Time Warner acquired  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> 's Turner Broadcasting System and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves.
Over the next few years,  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> 's presence as owner of the team would diminish.
A 95–67 record in 2000 produced a ninth consecutive division title.
However, a sweep at the hands of the St. Louis Cardinals prevented the Braves from reaching the National League Championship Series for a ninth consecutive time.
In 2001, Atlanta won the National League East division yet again, swept the Houston Astros in the NLDS, then lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Championship Series four games to one.
One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played rival New York Mets in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since 9/11.
In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Houston Astros.
 <START:person> Cy Young <END>  dominance.
Six National League Cy Young Awards in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers: 2005: A new generation.
In 2005, the Braves won the Division championship for the fourteenth consecutive time from 1991 to 2005.
Fourteen consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball.
The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs ( <START:person> Wilson Betemit <END> ,  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> ,  <START:person> Pete Orr <END> ,  <START:person> Ryan Langerhans <END> ,  <START:person> Jeff Francoeur <END> ).
Catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> , right fielder  <START:person> Jeff Francoeur <END> , and pitcher  <START:person> Kyle Davies <END>  all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta.
The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the "Baby Braves" by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to a record of 90–72.
However, the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the National League Division Series to the Astros in four games.
In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros battled back with a  <START:person> Lance Berkman <END>  grand slam and a two-out, ninth inning  <START:person> Brad Ausmus <END>  home run off of Braves closer  <START:person> Kyle Farnsworth <END> .
The game did not end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50 minutes.
 <START:person> Chris Burke <END>  ended the marathon with a home run off of  <START:person> Joey Devine <END> .
After the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach  <START:person> Leo Mazzone <END> , who left to go to the Baltimore Orioles.
 <START:person> Roger McDowell <END>  took his place in the Atlanta dugout.
Unable to re-sign shortstop  <START:person> Rafael Furcal <END> , the Braves acquired shortstop  <START:person> Edgar Rentería <END>  from the Boston Red Sox.
2006: Struggles.
In 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to.
Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6–21 record for the month of June, the worst month ever in the city of Atlanta, and just percentage points better than the Boston Braves of May 1935 (4–20).
The Braves made their move in July, going 14–10.
However, the team remained in the bottom half of the NL East and trailed the Mets by a double-digit deficit for much of the season (13 games at the All-Star Break).
However, despite their struggles, the Braves entered the break down by only six and a half games to the Dodgers for the NL Wild Card slot after winning seven of their last ten games.
After the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records.
They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span.
The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the Boston Beaneaters totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 – June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the 1930 New York Yankees to score ten runs or more in five straight games.
The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8–3 victory over Cincinnati on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break.
Additionally,  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie  <START:person> Paul Waner <END> 's 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.
The Braves made their first trade of the season on July 20 to shore up the bullpen, sending Class A Rome catcher  <START:person> Max Ramirez <END>  to Cleveland for closer  <START:person> Bob Wickman <END> .
He served as the Braves' closer for the remainder of the season, taking over for an embattled  <START:person> Jorge Sosa <END> , who was subsequently traded on the July 31 trade deadline for St. Louis minor league pitcher  <START:person> Rich Scalamandre <END> .
On July 29, the Braves traded reserve third baseman/shortstop  <START:person> Wilson Betemit <END>  to the Los Angeles Dodgers for reliever  <START:person> Danys Báez <END>  and infielder  <START:person> Willy Aybar <END> .
The move came on the night that starting third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  went on the 15-day disabled list with a strained oblique muscle.
With  <START:person> Betemit <END>  gone, Atlanta called up infielder  <START:person> Tony Pena <END> , Jr. from AAA Richmond to supplement  <START:person> Pete Orr <END> .
Before the expansion of rosters on September 1, the Braves acquired  <START:person> Daryle Ward <END>  from the Washington Nationals for Class A Myrtle Beach pitcher  <START:person> Luis Atilano <END> , in hopes that he would be a valuable pinch-hitter in the postseason.
However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the Florida Marlins mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves' eleven-year reign over the NL East.
On September 24, the Braves' loss to the Colorado Rockies mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season.
Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990.
Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie  <START:person> Chuck James <END>  besting  <START:person> Roger Clemens <END> , Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79–83.
After the season, the Atlanta coaching staff underwent a few changes.
 <START:person> Brian Snitker <END>  became the third base coach after  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  left to become the manager for the Florida Marlins.
 <START:person> Chino Cadahia <END>  replaced  <START:person> Pat Corrales <END>  as bench coach and former catcher  <START:person> Eddie Pérez <END>  became the new bullpen coach, replacing  <START:person> Bobby Dews <END> .
Sale to Liberty Media.
In December 2005, team owner Time Warner, who inherited the Braves after purchasing TBS in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale.
Liberty Media began negotiations to purchase the team.
In February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal that would sell the Braves to Liberty Media Group (a company which owned a large amount of stock in Time Warner, Inc.), pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball,  <START:person> Bud Selig <END> .
The deal included the exchange of the Braves, valued in the deal at $450 million, a hobbyist magazine publishing company, and $980 million cash, for 68.5 million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty Media, then worth approximately $1.48 billion.
Team President  <START:person> Terry McGuirk <END>  anticipated no change in the current front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day operations of the Braves.
Liberty Media is not expected to take any type of "active" ownership in terms of day-to-day operations.
On May 16, 2007, Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale of the Braves from Time Warner to Liberty Media.
2007: More struggles.
The Braves made their first moves by re-signing  <START:person> Bob Wickman <END>  to a one-year deal and picking up  <START:person> John Smoltz <END> 's option in September 2006.
They traded starting pitcher  <START:person> Horacio Ramírez <END>  to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher  <START:person> Rafael Soriano <END> , an American League reliever with a 2.20 ERA in 2006.
They also denied arbitration to pitcher  <START:person> Chris Reitsma <END>  and second baseman  <START:person> Marcus Giles <END> .
The Braves signed utility-man  <START:person> Chris Woodward <END>  to fill a spot on the bench.
The biggest trade in the offseason involved first baseman  <START:person> Adam LaRoche <END>  and a minor league player for Pittsburgh Pirates closer  <START:person> Mike González <END>  and a minor league infielder,  <START:person> Brent Lillibridge <END> .
 <START:person> Gonzalez <END> , who converted 24 of 24 save opportunities in 2006, joined  <START:person> Soriano <END>  as a set-up man for  <START:person> Wickman <END>  in the bullpen.
The team then signed  <START:person> Craig Wilson <END>  to a one-year deal to platoon with  <START:person> Scott Thorman <END> .
The Braves also had solid relievers in  <START:person> Macay McBride <END> ,  <START:person> Blaine Boyer <END> , and  <START:person> Tyler Yates <END> .
In addition, the majority of the Braves' offense, which was second in the NL in runs scored in 2006, returned in 2007.
However,  <START:person> Mike Hampton <END>  was sidelined for the entire 2007 season with yet another surgery.
 <START:person> Mike González <END>  was later sidelined for the season while recovering from  <START:person> Tommy John <END>  surgery.
The Braves' bullpen and offense came through in the clutch early on, helping the Braves to a 7–1 start, their best start since winning the World Series in 1995.

2010: Cox's final season.
The 2010 Atlanta Braves Season features the Braves' attempt to reclaim a postseason berth for the first time since 2005.
The Braves were once again skippered by  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END> , now in his 25th and final season managing the team.
The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April.
Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since 2000 when they won 16 in a row.
On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place Philadelphia Phillies at Turner Field to take sole possession of first place in the National League East standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August.
The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in 2005.
On July 13, 2010 at the 2010 MLB All-Star Game in Anaheim, Braves catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END>  was awarded the All-Star Game MVP Award for his clutch two-out, three-run double in the seventh inning to give the National League its first win in the All-Star Game since 1996.
He became the first Brave to win the All-Star Game MVP Award since  <START:person> Fred McGriff <END>  did so in 1994.
The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire Álex González,  <START:person> Rick Ankiel <END>  and  <START:person> Kyle Farnsworth <END>  from the Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals, giving up shortstop  <START:person> Yunel Escobar <END> , pitchers  <START:person> Jo-Jo Reyes <END>  and  <START:person> Jesse Chavez <END> , outfielder  <START:person> Gregor Blanco <END>  and three minor leaguers.
On August 18, 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman  <START:person> Derrek Lee <END>  from the Chicago Cubs.
On August 22, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs,  <START:person> Mike Minor <END>  struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record.
The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September, but won the NL Wild Card.
They lost to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four games.
Every game of the series was determined by one run.
After the series-clinching victory for the Giants in Game 4,  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  was given a standing ovation by the fans, also by players and coaches of both the Braves and Giants.
2011:  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  takes over.
On October 13, 2010, the Atlanta Braves announced that  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  would replace long-time Braves manager  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  as manager of the team in 2011.
The announcement came just two days after the 2010 Braves were eliminated from the postseason.
It was also announced that pitching coach  <START:person> Roger McDowell <END> , third-base coach  <START:person> Brian Snitker <END> , and bullpen coach  <START:person> Eddie Pérez <END>  would retain their current positions, while former hitting coach  <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END>  would replace  <START:person> Glenn Hubbard <END>  as the first-base coach and newcomer  <START:person> Carlos Tosca <END>  would become the new bench coach.
 <START:person> Hubbard <END>  and former bench coach  <START:person> Chino Cadahia <END>  were not offered positions on the new coaching staff.
 <START:person> Larry Parrish <END>  was hired as hitting coach on October 29, 2010.
On November 16, 2010 in an offseason trade, the Braves acquired  <START:person> Dan Uggla <END>  from the Florida Marlins in exchange for left-handed reliever  <START:person> Mike Dunn <END>  and infielder  <START:person> Omar Infante <END> .
According to Elias Sports Bureau, the Braves had an all-time franchise win-loss record over .500
for the first time since 1923 after their win over the Houston Astros on June 11, 2011.
The Braves franchise became the third franchise in MLB history to reach 10,000 wins with their win over the Washington Nationals on July 15, 2011.
On July 31, 2011, just sixteen days after registering their 10,000th win, the Florida Marlins defeated the Braves by a score of 3-1, handing the team the 10,000th loss in franchise history.
The Braves become only the second team in big league history with 10,000 losses after the Philadelphia Phillies reached the plateau in 2007.
Players from the Braves' farm system, such as  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  and  <START:person> Brandon Beachy <END> , played regularly with the big league club, while  <START:person> Julio Teherán <END> ,  <START:person> Randall Delgado <END> , and  <START:person> Mike Minor <END>  were called up for spot starts.
With late season injuries to starters  <START:person> Jair Jurrjens <END>  and  <START:person> Tommy Hanson <END> , these three young pitchers made their way into the starting rotation in their absence.
Eight players made their major league debuts for the team in 2011.
September collapse.
The Braves led the National League Wild Card standings for much of the 2011 season, with the division-rival Philadelphia Phillies firmly in control of first place in the National League East.
The Braves entered the final month of the regular season 25 games above .500
with a record of 80–55 and an 8 1⁄2-game lead in the Wild Card standings.
The nearest team trailing them, the St. Louis Cardinals, who also trailed the National League Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers by 8 1⁄2 games at the time, were considered a long-shot to gain a spot in the postseason.
Just days prior on August 26, the Cardinals found themselves 10 1⁄2 games behind and in third place.
With 27 games to play, the Braves went 9–18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89–73.
The Cardinals, meanwhile, went 18–8 to finish at 90–72.
Braves closer  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END> , who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August, carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves.
After being dominant in his role for much of the season, Braves setup man  <START:person> Jonny Venters <END>  posted a 5.11 September ERA.
These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by Braves manager  <START:person> Fredi González <END> .
Veteran starter  <START:person> Derek Lowe <END>  posted a win-loss record of 0–5 in September with an ERA of 8.75.
Shortly into the offseason,  <START:person> Lowe <END>  would be traded to the Cleveland Indians.
The Braves starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games.
Over the last five games, all of which were losses for the Braves, the team managed to score only seven runs.
Braves catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> , often regarded as the best offensive catcher in the Majors, hit only .183 with two home runs in September.
The offense as a whole hit for only a .235
batting average and a .300
on-base percentage in September, both second-worst in the National League.
The .195
RISP average by Braves hitters was second worst in the Majors.
Hitting coach  <START:person> Larry Parrish <END>  was fired two days following the last game of the season.
2012:  <START:person> Chipper <END> 's last season.
In 2012, the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season.
On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team.
The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher  <START:person> Derek Lowe <END> , shortstop  <START:person> Alex González <END> , and outfielder  <START:person> Nate McLouth <END> .
To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder  <START:person> Michael Bourn <END> , along with shortstops  <START:person> Tyler Pastornicky <END>  and  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END> .
To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by  <START:person> Lowe <END>  (as well as a mid-season injury to  <START:person> Brandon Beachy <END> ), manager  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  elected relief pitcher  <START:person> Kris Medlen <END>  to the starting pitching rotation.
The Braves went on to win every game  <START:person> Medlen <END>  started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23).
Atlanta stayed close to the Washington Nationals in the race to win the National League East title.
They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race.
Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild card race.
Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a playoff game before entering into the Division Series.
The Braves played the St. Louis Cardinals in the first ever Wild Card Game.
The Braves were behind 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END>  hit a fly ball to left field that dropped in between the Cardinals shortstop and left fielder.
Umpire  <START:person> Sam Holbrook <END>  called  <START:person> Simmons <END>  out, citing the infield fly rule.
Had an infield fly not been called,  <START:person> Simmons <END>  would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out.
Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes.
The Braves lost the game 6–3, ending their season.
2013: Braves win the East.
During the offseason following a gut wrenching exit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the Wild Card Game, the Braves spent the 2012-2013 offseason revamping and retooling their offense.
The Braves turned heads across baseball by acquiring  <START:person> B.J. Upton <END>  from the Tampa Bay Rays, signing him to a 5-year $75.25 million contract and making him their starting center fielder, and uniting him with his younger brother  <START:person> Justin Upton <END>  from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a seven player trade that sent fan favorite utility man  <START:person> Martin Prado <END>  to the Diamondbacks, they also filled a need for a new Third Baseman in  <START:person> Chris Johnson <END>  after the retirement of  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  the previous year.
The Braves began the 2013 season with a hot start in April by going 17-9 for the month, which saw the emergence of rookie sensation  <START:person> Evan Gattis <END> , while taking hold of first place in the National League East division, a lead they would never relinquish for the rest of the season.
The Braves suffered many injuries to key players throughout the season, including injuries to  <START:person> Jason Heyward <END> ,  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> ,  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END> ,  <START:person> Eric O'Flaherty <END> ,  <START:person> Jonny Venters <END> ,  <START:person> Ramiro Pena <END>  and others, but found a way to win despite these blows to the team.
Leading up to the All Star break, First Baseman  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  was voted in to play for the 2013 National League All-Star Team, in the 2013 All Star Game, which he did not play.
The Braves also witnessed the emergence of rookie pitcher  <START:person> Julio Teheran <END>  after much hype during Spring Training.
From July 26 to August 10, the Braves won 14 games in a row.
The winning streak was the longest of its kind since April–May 2000.
On June 28, 2013 the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END> ' jersey, number 10, before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
He was honored before 51,300 fans at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia.
He served as a staple of the Braves franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season.
 <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  played his last regular season game for the Braves on September 30, 2012.
The Braves opened up a 15-game lead on the Washington Nationals in the National League East on September 3, 2013, riding that lead en route to its first division title since 2005, the last of 14 straight division titles.
This was also Braves manager  <START:person> Fredi Gonzalez <END> 's first division title since beginning his managerial career in 1990; including his first since becoming the manager of the Braves after the 2010 season.
The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22, 2013 after a Nationals loss to the Marlins in the first game of a double header; the Braves also won their game that day, beating the Chicago Cubs 5-2 at Wrigley Field.
2014.
On November 11, 2013, the Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field for a new stadium in Cobb County, in the northwest suburbs outside of Atlanta in 2017.
The move is to follow the expiration of the Braves' 20-year lease on Turner Field in 2016.
The new stadium is to be constructed in a public/private partnership.
During the offseason the Braves signed few of their young talents to multi year contracts;  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END>  (4 years/$42M),  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  (8 years/$135M),  <START:person> Kris Medlen <END>  (1 year/$5.8M),
 <START:person> Jason Heyward <END>  (2 years/$13.3M),
 <START:person> Julio Teherán <END>  (6 years/$32.4M)
and  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END>  (7 years/$58M).
The Braves finished the season in a distant second place with a 79-83 record, which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990.
2015.
Prior to the 2015 season, the Braves fired their General Manager  <START:person> Frank Wren <END> , and  <START:person> John Hart <END>  replaced him as interim GM, choosing to only take the title of President of Baseball Operations.
The Braves promptly traded Gold Glove Award winner  <START:person> Jason Heyward <END>  to the St. Louis Cardinals along with pitcher  <START:person> Jordan Walden <END>  for pitchers  <START:person> Shelby Miller <END>  and  <START:person> Tyrell Jenkins <END> .
 <START:person> Hart <END>  would then trade All Star left fielder  <START:person> Justin Upton <END>  to the San Diego Padres for Max Fried,  <START:person> Jace Peterson <END> ,  <START:person> Dustin Peterson <END> , and  <START:person> Mallex Smith <END> .
Catcher  <START:person> Evan Gattis <END>  and minor league prospect  <START:person> James Hoyt <END>  were traded to the Houston Astros for minor leaguers  <START:person> Mike Foltynewicz <END> ,  <START:person> Rio Ruiz <END> , and  <START:person> Andrew Thurman <END> .
A day before the season began, the braves made a final trade involving former AllStar  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END>  and outfielder  <START:person> Melvin Upton Jr <END> ..
They were traded to the San Diego Padres for outfielders  <START:person> Cameron Maybin <END>  and  <START:person> Carlos Quentin <END>  along with two minor league players.
By the beginning of the season, the Braves did 11 trades in all.

Acadia University  Acadia University is a predominantly undergraduate university located in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada with some graduate programs at the master's level and one at the doctoral level.
The enabling legislation consists of Acadia University Act and the Amended Acadia University Act 2000.
The Wolfville Campus houses Acadia University Archives and the Acadia University Art Gallery.
Acadia offers over 200 degree combinations in the Faculties of Arts, Pure and Applied Science, Professional Studies, and Theology.
The student-faculty ratio is 15:1 and the average class size is 28.
Open Acadia offers correspondence and distance education courses.
History.
Acadia began as an extension of Horton Academy (1828), which was founded in Horton, Nova Scotia, by Baptists from Nova Scotia and Queen's College (1838).
The College was later named Acadia College.
Acadia University, established at Wolfville, Nova Scotia in 1838 has a strong Baptist religious affiliation.
It was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members.
The two major Universities of the day in Nova Scotia were heavily controlled by Denominational structures.
King's College (University of King's College) was an Anglican School and Dalhousie University, which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the Church of Scotland.
It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar,  <START:person> Edmund Crawley <END> , to the Chair of Classics, as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a College established and run by the Baptists.
In 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for  <START:person> Queen Victoria <END> ).
The College began with 21 students in January 1839.
The name "Queen's College" was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed "Acadia College" in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an Acadian settlement.
Acadia College awarded its first degrees in 1843 and became Acadia University in 1891, established by the Acadia University Act.
The Granville Street Baptist Church (now First Baptist Church (Halifax)) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the University.
It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development.
Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president  <START:person> John Pryor <END> , were members of the First Baptist Church Halifax congregation.
Similarly, the adjacent Wolfville United Baptist Church plays a significant role in the life of the university.
The original charter of the college stated: And be it further enacted, that no religious tests or subscriptions shall be required of the Professors Fellows, Scholars, Graduates or Officers of the said College; but that all the privileges and advantages thereof shall be open and free to all and every Person and Persons whomsoever, without regard to religious persuasion ...
And it shall and may be lawful for the trustees and Governors of the said College to select as Professors, and other Teaches or Officers, competent persons of any religious persuasion whatever, provided such person or persons shall be of moral and religious character.
This was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff.
In 1851, the power of appointing governors was transferred from the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces.
 <START:person> Charles Osborne Wickenden <END>  (architect), and  <START:person> J.C. Dumaresq <END>  designed the Central Building, Acadia College, 1878–79.
 <START:person> Clara Belle Marshall <END> , from Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia, became the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879.

Today,  <START:person> Horton Hall <END>  is the home of the Department of Psychology and Research and Graduate Studies.
 <START:person> Emmerson Hall <END> , built in 1913, is particularly interesting for the variety of building stones used.
In 1967  <START:person> Emmerson Hall <END>  was converted to classrooms and offices for the School of Education.
It is a registered Heritage Property.
Unveiled on 16 August 1963, a wooden and metal organ in Manning Chapel, Acadia University, is dedicated to Acadia University's war dead of the First World War.
A memorial pipe organ in Convovation Hall, Acadia University is dedicated to the members of Acadia University killed during the First World War A book of remembrance in Manning Chapel, Acadia University was unveiled on 1 March 1998 through the efforts of the Wolfville Historical Society  In 1966, the Baptist denomination relinquished direct control over the University.
The denomination maintains nine seats on the University's Board of Governors.
On 4 January 2008, Dr.  <START:person> Gail Dinter-Gottlieb <END>  decided to step down as President and Vice Chancellor of the University before her term expired.
Her resignation was effective 29 February 2008.

The Acadia Advantage.
In 1996, Acadia University pioneered the use of mobile computing technology in a post-secondary educational environment.
This academic initiative, named the Acadia Advantage, integrated the use of notebook computers into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching.
By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were taking part in the initiative.
The initiative went beyond leasing notebook computers to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond.
Because of its pioneering efforts, Acadia is a laureate of Washington's Smithsonian Institution and a part of the permanent research collection of the National Museum of American History.
It is the only Canadian university selected for inclusion in the Education and Academia category of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award.
In addition, Acadia University received the Pioneer Award for Ubiquitous Computing.
In 2001, it achieved high rankings in the annual "Maclean's" University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum.
In October 2006, Dr.  <START:person> Dinter-Gottlieb <END>  established a commission to review the Acadia Advantage learning environment 10 years after inception.
The mandate of the commission was to determine how well the current Advantage program meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff and to examine how the role of technology in the postsecondary environment has changed at Acadia, and elsewhere.
The commission was asked to recommend changes and enhancements to the Acadia Advantage that would benefit the entire university community and ensure its sustainability.
Some of the recommendations coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased notebook computers to a student-owned computer model.
The compelling rationale for this was the integral role technology now plays in our lives, which was not present in 1996.
The University was also advised to unbundle its tuition structure so that the cost of an Acadia education is more detailed and students can understand how their investment in the future of the school is allotted.
In September 2008, Acadia moved to a student-owned notebook computer version of the Acadia Advantage, now named Acadia Advantage 2.0.
Athletics.
Acadia's sports teams are called the Axemen and Axewomen.
They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of Canadian Interuniversity Sport.
School spirit abounds with men's and women's varsity teams that have delivered more conference and national championships than any other institution in Atlantic University Sport.
Routinely, more than one-third of Acadia's varsity athletes also achieve Academic All-Canadian designation through Canadian Interuniversity Sport by maintaining a minimum average of 80 per cent.
Expansion and modernization of  <START:person> Raymond Field <END>  was completed in the fall of 2007 and features the installation of an eight-lane all-weather running track and a move to the same premium artificial turf used by the New England Patriots of the National Football League for its main playing field.
The Raymond Field modernization was a gift to the university by friends, alumni, and the province.
War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams.
In September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club and the Acadia Masters Swim Club to form the Acadia Swim Club and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14-year hiatus.
On 26 September 2008, the university announced its intention to return swimming to a varsity status in September 2009.
Fight song.
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: "Stand Up and Cheer", the Acadia University fight song.
According to 'Songs of Acadia College' (Wolfville, NS 1902-3, 1907), the songs include: 'Acadia Centennial Song' (1938); 'The Acadia Clan Song'; 'Alma Mater Acadia;' 'Alma Mater Acadia' (1938) and 'Alma Mater Song.' Symbols.
In 1974, Acadia was granted a coat of arms designed by the College of Arms in London, England.
The coat of arms is two-tone, with the school's official colours, garnet and blue, on the shield.
The axes represent the school's origins in a rural setting, and the determination of its founders who cleared the land and built the school on donated items and labour.
The open books represent the intellectual pursuits of a university, and the wolves heads are a whimsical representation of the University's location in Wolfville.
"In pulvere vinces" (In dust you conquer) is the motto.
The University seal depicts the Greek goddess of wisdom Athena in front of the first college hall.
The University also uses a stylized "A" as a logo for its sports teams.
Notable among a number of fight songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: the Acadia University alma mater set to the tune of "Annie Lisle".
The lyrics are: Historic buildings at Acadia University.
Seminary House, also known as the Ladies' Seminary, is a Second Empire style-building constructed in 1878 as a home for women attending the university.
It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997 as Canada's oldest facility associated with the higher education of women.
Carnegie Hall, built in 1909, is a large, two-storey, Neo-classical brick building.
It was designated under the provincial Heritage Property Act in 1989 as its construction in 1909 signified Acadia's evolution from classical college to liberal university.
Student life.
At Acadia University, students have access to the Student Union Building which serves as a hub for students and houses many Student Union organizations.
The building also houses The Axe Lounge, a convenience store, an information desk and two food outlets.
The university press, The Athenaeum, is a member of CUP.
Student government.
All students are represented by the Acadia Students' Union.
The Union Executive for the 2013–2014 academic year: President  <START:person> Callie Lathem <END> , Vice President Programming  <START:person> Chelsey Spinney <END> , Vice President Academic  <START:person> Liam Murphy <END> , Vice President Finance  <START:person> Jalen Sabean <END> , Vice President Communications  <START:person> Suzanne Gray <END> .
The student newspaper is "The Athenaeum."
Residences.
Approximately 1500 students live on-campus in 12 residences:  Arthur Eddington  Sir  <START:person> Arthur Stanley Eddington <END> , OM, FRS (28 December 1882 – 22 November 1944) was a British astronomer, physicist, and mathematician of the early 20th century who did his greatest work in astrophysics.
He was also a philosopher of science and a popularizer of science.
The Eddington limit, the natural limit to the luminosity of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour.
He is famous for his work regarding the theory of relativity.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrote a number of articles that announced and explained  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's theory of general relativity to the English-speaking world.
World War I severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England.
He also conducted an expedition to observe the Solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 that provided one of the earliest confirmations of relativity, and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.
Early years.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was born 28 December 1882 in Kendal,  <START:person> Westmorland <END>  (now Cumbria), England, the son of Quaker parents,  <START:person> Arthur Henry Eddington <END>  and  <START:person> Sarah Ann Shout <END> .
His father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to  <START:person> Kendal <END>  to become headmaster of Stramongate School.
He died in the typhoid epidemic which swept England in 1884.
His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income.
The family moved to Weston-super-Mare where at first  <START:person> Stanley <END>  (as his mother and sister always called  <START:person> Eddington <END> ) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.
In 1893  <START:person> Eddington <END>  entered Brynmelyn School.
He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature.
His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the University of Manchester) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year.
He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to physics for the next three years.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers,  <START:person> Arthur Schuster <END>  and  <START:person> Horace Lamb <END> .
At Manchester,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician  <START:person> J. W. Graham <END> .
His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a B.Sc. in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.
Based on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge in 1902.
His tutor at Cambridge was  <START:person> Robert Alfred Herman <END>  and in 1904  <START:person> Eddington <END>  became the first ever second-year student to be placed as Senior Wrangler.
After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on thermionic emission in the Cavendish Laboratory.
This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students.
This hiatus was brief.
Death.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  died of cancer in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 22 November 1944.
His body was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium (Cambridgeshire) on 27 November 1944; the cremated remains were buried in the grave of his mother in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.
Astronomy.
In January 1906,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the Astronomer Royal at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.
He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month.
He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the parallax of 433 Eros on photographic plates that had started in 1900.
He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the  <START:person> Smith <END> 's Prize in 1907.
The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge.
In December 1912  <START:person> George Darwin <END> , son of  <START:person> Charles Darwin <END> , died suddenly and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was promoted to his chair as the Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in early 1913.
Later that year,  <START:person> Robert Ball <END> , holder of the theoretical  <START:person> Lowndean <END>  chair also died, and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was named the director of the entire Cambridge Observatory the next year.
In May 1914 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and won their Royal Medal in 1918 and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1926.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  also investigated the interior of stars through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes.
He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for Cepheid variables.
He began by extending  <START:person> Karl Schwarzschild <END> 's earlier work on radiation pressure in Emden polytropic models.
These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere.
He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior.
However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, density and pressure at all points inside a star, and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics.
 <START:person> James Jeans <END>  contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be ionized, but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important mass-luminosity relation.
This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as ideal gases.
In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy.
Jeans and others defended the  <START:person> Kelvin <END> – <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  mechanism, which was based on classical mechanics, while  <START:person> Eddington <END>  speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.
With these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees.
In 1924, he discovered the mass-luminosity relation for stars (see Lecchini in #External links and references ).
Despite some disagreement,  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution.
The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by  <START:person> Michelson <END>  in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's intuitive, exploratory style.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as "The Internal Constitution of the Stars", which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and  <START:person> Edward Arthur Milne <END> .
An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in quantum physics, including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.
Dispute with  <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END>  on existence of black holes.
The topic of extension of his models precipitated his famous dispute with  <START:person> Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar <END> , who was then a student at Cambridge.
 <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's work presaged the discovery of black holes, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  refused to believe that  <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world.
History clearly proved  <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrong, but his motivation remains a matter of some controversy.
 <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays  <START:person> Eddington <END>  as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist.
This is at variance with  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's character as described by other contemporaries.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain away the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.
Relativity.
During World War I,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from  <START:person> Willem de Sitter <END>  regarding  <START:person> Einstein <END> ’s theory of general relativity.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his Quaker religious beliefs, one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist.
He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain.
He and Astronomer Royal  <START:person> Frank Watson Dyson <END>  organized two expeditions to observe a solar eclipse in 1919 to make the first empirical test of  <START:person> Einstein <END> ’s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field.
In fact,  <START:person> Dyson <END> ’s argument for the indispensability of  <START:person> Eddington <END> ’s expertise in this test was what prevented  <START:person> Eddington <END>  from eventually having to enter military service.
When conscription was introduced in Britain on 2 March 1916,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  intended to apply for an exemption as a conscientious objector.
Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's work being of national interest.
In 1918, this was appealed against by the Ministry of National Service.
Before the appeal tribunal in June,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognised and would have ended his exemption in August 1918.
A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record.
Astronomer Royal, Sir  <START:person> Frank Dyson <END> , supported  <START:person> Eddington <END>  at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's essential role in the solar eclipse expedition to Principe in May 1919.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  made clear his willingness to serve in the Friends' Ambulance Unit, the Red Cross, or as a harvest labourer.
However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of  <START:person> Eddington <END>  continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Principe expedition.
The war ended before the end of his exemption.
After the war,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  travelled to the island of Príncipe near Africa to watch the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919.
During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars in the region around the Sun.
According to the theory of general relativity, stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field.
This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by  <START:person> Einstein <END> .
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's observations published the next year confirmed  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's theory, and were hailed at the time as a conclusive proof of general relativity over the Newtonian model.
The news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story.
Afterward,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations.
It has been claimed that  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's observations were of poor quality, and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at Sobral, Brazil, which appeared closer to the Newtonian model, but a 1979 re-analysis with modern measuring equipment and contemporary software validated  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's results and conclusions.
The quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations, but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers.
The rejection of the results from the Brazil expedition was due to a defect in the telescopes used which, again, was completely accepted and well-understood by contemporary astronomers.
Throughout this period,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific.
He collected many of these into the "Mathematical Theory of Relativity" in 1923, which  <START:person> Albert Einstein <END>  suggested was "the finest presentation of the subject in any language."
He was an early advocate of  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment:  <START:person> Ludwik Silberstein <END> , a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached  <START:person> Eddington <END>  at the Royal Society's (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged  <START:person> Arthur <END>  as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory ( <START:person> Silberstein <END> , of course, was including himself and  <START:person> Einstein <END>  as the other two).
When  <START:person> Eddington <END>  refrained from replying, he insisted  <START:person> Arthur <END>  not be "so shy", whereupon  <START:person> Eddington <END>  replied, "Oh, no!
I was wondering who the third one might be!" Cosmology.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models.
He had been investigating the instability of the  <START:person> Einstein <END>  universe when he learned of both  <START:person> Lemaître <END> 's 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession on the spiral nebulae.
He felt the cosmological constant must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics.
In "The Mathematical Theory of Relativity,"  <START:person> Eddington <END>  interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is "self-gauging".
Fundamental theory and the  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number.
During the 1920s until his death, he increasingly concentrated on what he called "fundamental theory" which was intended to be a unification of quantum theory, relativity, cosmology, and gravitation.
At first he progressed along "traditional" lines, but turned increasingly to an almost numerological analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.
His basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number.
In many cases these would result in numbers close to 1040, its square, or its square root.
He was convinced that the mass of the proton and the charge of the electron were a "natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe" and that their values were not accidental.
One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics,  <START:person> Paul Dirac <END> , also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the  <START:person> Dirac <END>  large numbers hypothesis, and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.
A somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the fine structure constant, α.
At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons.
Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the degrees of freedom, so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number.
Wags at the time started calling him "Arthur Adding-one".
This change of stance detracted from  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's credibility in the physics community.
The is estimated at 1/137.035 999 074(44).
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed "E-numbers" (representing a certain group – a  <START:person> Clifford <END>  algebra).
These in effect incorporated spacetime into a higher-dimensional structure.
While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a grand unified theory.
Moreover,  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics.
In particular, he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the Universe 136 x 2256, or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons + electrons.
When equalized with the non-dark energy equivalent number of hydrogen atoms (3/10) x Rc2/GmH, this corresponds to a Universe radius R = 13.8
Giga light year, a value predicted for years from universal constants using an atomic-cosmic symmetry, and compatible with c-times the so-called Universe age 13.80(4) Gyr, as determined by the recent mission Planck (March 2003).
He did not complete this line of research before his death in 1944; his book "Fundamental Theory" was published posthumously in 1948.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  number for cycling.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  is credited with devising a measure of a cyclist's long-distance riding achievements.
The  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days.
For example an  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions.
Achieving a high  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's own E-number was 84.
The  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number for cycling is analogous to the "h"-index that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.
Philosophy.
Idealism.
Sir  <START:person> Arthur Eddington <END>  wrote in his book "The Nature of the Physical World" that "The stuff of the world is mind-stuff."
The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds...
The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it...
It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature...
It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character.
But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference." <START:person> —Eddington <END> ,
"The Nature of the Physical World", 276-81.
The idealist conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.
The first derives directly from current physical theory.
Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behavior of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics.
From this,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required.
The second, and more interesting argument, was based on  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts.
First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness.
We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is "mind-stuff."
Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.
But, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material.
To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world.
However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties.
But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.
 <START:person> Ian Barbour <END> , in his book Issues in Science and Religion (1966), p. 133, cites  <START:person> Arthur Eddington <END> 's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) for a text that argues The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for "the defense of the idea of human freedom" and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical idealism "the thesis that reality is basically mental".
 <START:person> Charles De Koninck <END>  points out that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase "mind-stuff" to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same "stuff" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.
As  <START:person> De Koninck <END>  quotes  <START:person> Eddington <END> , There is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it.
I will not discuss the doctrine since I have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection.
At any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon.
In the scientific world (which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing) there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer; it reflects sunlight when no one sees it; it has mass when no one is measuring the mass; it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance; and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date. <START:person> —Eddington <END> ,
"The Nature of the Physical World", 226 Indeterminism.
Against  <START:person> Albert Einstein <END>  and others who advocated determinism, indeterminism—championed by  <START:person> Eddington <END> —says that a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the epistemological limitations of physicists' understanding.
The uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, then, would not necessarily be due to hidden variables but to an indeterminism in nature itself.
Popular and philosophical writings.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrote a clever parody of "The Rubaiyat of  <START:person> Omar Khayyam <END> ", recounting his 1919 solar eclipse experiment.
It contained the following quatrain:  <poem> Oh leave the Wise our measures to collate  One thing at least is certain, LIGHT has WEIGHT, One thing is certain, and the rest debate — Light-rays, when near the Sun, DO NOT GO STRAIGHT.</poem>
During the 1920s and 30s,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  gave innumerable lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity, in addition to his textbook "The Mathematical Theory of Relativity", and later, quantum mechanics.
Many of these were gathered into books, including "The Nature of the Physical World" and "New Pathways in Science".
His skillful use of literary allusions and humor helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of  <START:person> Eddington <END> ’s clear and entertaining exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics.
He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum physics) provided new room for personal religious experience and free will.
Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.
He is sometimes misunderstood as having promoted the infinite monkey theorem in his 1928 book "The Nature of the Physical World", with the phrase "If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the British Museum".
It is clear from the context that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration.
On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term "improbable" is functionally equivalent to "impossible".
His popular writings made him, quite literally, a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.
Adrenal gland  The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a wide variety of hormones.
They are found on the top of the kidneys and consist of a number of different layers that directly influence the structure and function of the glands.
Each gland has an outer cortex made of steroid-producing cells surrounding a core of medulla, formed by chromaffin cells in direct relationship with the sympathetic nervous system.
The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones according to their functions and microscopic appearance.
The adrenal cortex produces a class of steroid hormones, the corticosteroids, which are classified according to their effects.
Mineralocorticoids, produced in the zona glomerulosa, help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance.
Glucocorticoids such as cortisol, are synthesized in the zona fasciculata and their functions include regulation of glycogen and lipid metabolism and immune system suppression.
The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis produces androgens (steroid hormones) that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs.
The production of steroid hormones is named steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells.
The medulla produces the catecholamines, epinephrine, and norepinephrine which function to provoke a quick response on diverse organs in stress situations.
Regulation of synthesis and secretion of adrenal hormones is equally varied.
Mineralocorticoid production is mainly under influence of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, in which specialized juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys monitor blood volume and start a cascade of reactions that leads to the stimulation of aldosterone synthesis in the zona glomerulosa.
Cortisol and androgen synthesis are under control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a classic example of a negative feedback loop, in which the hypothalamus and pituitary gland release stimulating hormones whenever cortisol levels are low.
In contrast, release of medullary catecholamines is regulated by direct innervation from the sympathetic nervous system.
There are a number of endocrine diseases and disorders that can affect the normal functioning of the adrenal gland.
Overproduction of corticosteroid hormones leads to  <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome, whereas insufficiency is commonly associated with  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by a disregulation of endocrine control mechanisms.
A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue, and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.
Structure.
The adrenal glands are located bilaterally in the retroperitoneum superior and slightly medial to the kidneys.
In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left adrenal gland is semilunar in shape; in non-humans, they are quadrilateral in shape.
The combined weight of the adrenal glands in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10 grams.
The adrenal glands are surrounded by an adipose capsule and are enclosed within the renal fascia, a fibrous structure that also surrounds the kidney.
A weak septum of connective tissue separates the glands from the kidneys and facilitates surgical removal of the kidneys without damage to the glands.
The adrenal glands are in close relationship with the diaphragm, and are attached to the crura of the diaphragm by means of the renal fascia.
Each adrenal gland has two anatomically and functionally distinct parts, the outer adrenal cortex and the inner medulla, both of which produce hormones.
The cortex mainly produces aldosterone, cortisol and androgens, while the medulla produces adrenaline and noradrenaline.
Cortex.
The adrenal cortex is devoted to production of corticosteroid and androgen hormones.
Specific cortical cells produce particular hormones including aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens such as androstenedione.
Under normal unstressed conditions, the human adrenal glands produce the equivalent of 35–40 mg of cortisone acetate per day.
The adrenal cortex comprises three zones, or layers.
This "anatomic zonation" can be appreciated at the microscopic level, where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics.
The adrenal cortex exhibits "functional zonation" as well: by virtue of the characteristic enzymes present in each zone, the zones produce and secrete distinct hormones.
Zona glomerulosa.
The outermost layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona glomerulosa, lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland.
Cells in this layer form ovoid groups, separated by trabeculae of connective tissue that are continuous with the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.
This layer is the main site for production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, by the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase.
Aldosterone is a hormone largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure.
The expression of neuron-specific proteins in the zona glomerulosa cells of human adrenocortical tissues has been predicted and reported by several authors and it was suggested that the expression of proteins like the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the cells of the zona glomerulosa reflects the regenerative feature of these cells, which would lose NCAM immunoreactivity after moving to the zona fasciculata.
However, together with other data on neuroendocrine properties of zona glomerulosa cells, NCAM expression may reflect a neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells.
Voltage-dependent calcium channels have been detected in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, which suggests that calcium-channel blockers may directly influence the adrenocortical biosynthesis of aldosterone in vivo.
Zona fasciculata.
Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the zona fasciculata is responsible for producing mainly glucocorticoids such as cortisol.
It is the widest of the three layers as it composes nearly 80% of the cortical volume.
The cells, arranged in columns radially oriented towards the medulla, have numerous lipid droplets responsible of the pale staining nature of the cytoplasm.
Abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum are also present in the cells of this layer.
Zona reticularis.
The innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly next to the medulla.
It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans.
Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue.
The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.
Medulla.
The adrenal medulla is the core of the adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex.
The chromaffin cells of the medulla (named for their characteristic brown staining with chromic acid salts) are the body's main source of the circulating catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla.
Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted.
To carry out its part of this response, the adrenal medulla receives input from the sympathetic nervous system through preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord from T5–T11.
Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion.
Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.
Blood supply.
Although variations of the blood supply to the adrenal glands (and kidneys) are common, there are usually three arteries that supply each adrenal gland: Venous drainage of the adrenal glands is achieved via the suprarenal veins: The central adrenomedullary vein is a particular type of blood vessel in the adrenal medulla.
Its structure is different from the other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.
The suprarenal vein exits the adrenal gland through a depression on its anterior surface known as the hilum.
Note that the arteries supplying the suprarenal gland do not pass through the hilum.
The suprarenal veins may form anastomoses with the inferior phrenic veins.
Since the right supra-renal vein is short and drains directly into the inferior vena cava it is likely to injure the latter during removal of right adrenal for various reasons.
The adrenal glands (alongside the thyroid gland) have one of the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue of any organ.
Up to 60 arterioles may enter each adrenal gland.
This may be one of the reasons that lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the adrenals.
Function.
The adrenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other parts of the body.
These hormones are involved in a number of different pathways.
Corticosteroid production.
All corticosteroid hormones share cholesterol as a common precursor.
In consequence, the first step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis.
Cells that produce steroid hormones provide themselves with cholesterol in various ways.
Their main source is dietary cholesterol transported in the blood as LDL, which enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, although endogenous synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum is sufficient when LDL levels are abnormally low as represented in people with abetalipoproteinemia (a genetic disorder of intestinal lipid absorption).
In lysosomes, cholesterol is separated from the proteic component of LDL and then stored within cell membranes or bound with proteins.
The initial part of conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones involves a number of enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that are located in the inner membrane of mitochondria.
Transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane is facilitated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and is the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis.
The functional zonation of the adrenal cortex is determined by the presence of distinct enzymes in each particular layer, explaining how the different layers produce unique hormones from a common precursor.
The first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase.
After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it.
Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs).
Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones.
Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases.
For example, the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.
Regulation of corticosteroid production.
Glucocorticoids are under the regulatory influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone of the anterior pituitary.
In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated by the presence of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus.
ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes.
The HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis.
The HPA-axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.
Mineralocorticoid secretion is regulated mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), the concentration of potassium, and ACTH to a lesser extent.
Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II.
Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.
Catecholamine production.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines, water-soluble compounds that have a structure made of a catechol group and an amino group.
The adrenal glands are responsible for the majority of circulating epinephrine (adrenaline) in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating norepinephrine (noradrenaline).
These hormones are released in the adrenal medulla, which is richly vascular.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.
Catecholamines are produced in chromaffin cells (the main type of cells in the adrenal medulla) from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver.
The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in the first step of catecholamine synthesis.
L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into norepinephrine.
In the cytosol, norepinephrine is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules.
Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.
The adrenal medulla is innervated by splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system, which signal the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.
Effects of adrenal hormones.
Mineralocorticoids.
Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid produced in the body.
Its effects are on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct).
Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates.
Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation.
Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium (Ca2+) entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry.
However, mouse zona glomerulosa cells within adrenal slices spontaneously generate membrane potential oscillations of low periodicity; this innate electrical excitability of zona glomerulosa cells provides a platform for the production of a recurrent Ca2+ channels signal that can be controlled by angiotensin II and extracellular potassium, the two major regulators of aldosterone production.[30]
Angiotensin II originates from plasmatic angiotensin I after the conversion of angiotensinogen by renin produced by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney.[
Glucocorticoids.
Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid produced under normal conditions and its actions include mobilization of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, but it does not increase under starvation conditions.
Additionally, cortisol enhances the activity of other hormones including glucagon and catecholamines.
The zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary.
Adrenal androgens.
Cells in zona reticularis of the adrenal glands produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most important of which is DHEA.
In general, these hormones do not have an overall effect in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines that act at adrenergic receptors throughout the body, with effects including constriction of small arteries, dilation of veins, and an increase in the heartrate.
Adrenergic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors.
This means that they interact with G proteins, a family of enzymes that start a chain of reactions leading to the formation of intracellular second messengers.
There are many classes of adrenergic receptors, and the specific response in the cell upon binding of either epinephrine or norepinephrine depends on the mechanism of action of those receptors.
For example, when epinephrine or norepinephrine bind to β-adrenergic receptors, the level of cAMP (a second messenger) rises inside the cell, but if they bind to α2-adrenergic receptors in other tissues, the level of cAMP lowers.
Development.
The adrenal glands are composed of two heterogenous types of tissue: in the center there is the adrenal medulla, which produces and releases mostly adrenaline to the blood in stress situations as part of the sympathetic nervous system.
Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a wide variety of steroid hormones.
These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal developments.
Cortex.
Adrenal cortex tissue is derived from the intermediate mesoderm.
It first appears 33 days after fertilisation, shows steroidogenic (steroid hormone production) capabilities by the eighth week and undergoes rapid growth during the first trimester of pregnancy.
The fetal adrenal cortex is different from its adult counterpart, as it is composed of two distinct zones: the inner fetal zone, which carries most of the hormone-producing activity, and the outer definitive zone, which is in a proliferative phase.
The fetal zone produces large amounts of adrenal androgens (male sex hormones) that are used by the placenta for estrogen biosynthesis.
Cortical development of the adrenal gland is regulated mostly by ACTH, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates cortisol synthesis.
During midgestation, the fetal zone occupies most of the cortical volume and produces 100–200 mg/day of DHEA-S, an androgen and precursor of both androgens and estrogens (female sex hormones).
Adrenal hormones, especially glucocorticoids such as cortisol are considered essential for prenatal development of organs, particularly for the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The adrenal gland decreases in size after birth because of the rapid disappearance of the fetal zone, with a decrease in androgen secretion.
Adrenarche.
During childhood, androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but several years before puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of DHEA and DHEA-S.
These changes are part of a process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates.
Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex.
Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.
Medulla.
The adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which come from the ectoderm layer of the embryo.
These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs.
These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system.
Cells of the adrenal medulla are also called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs.
Glucocorticoid production by the adrenal cortex was thought to be responsible for this differentiation, but now the available data suggest that BMP-4 secreted in the adrenal tissue is the primary responsible for the differentiation, and that glucocorticoids have a role in the posterior development of the cells.
Clinical significance.
Corticosteroid overproduction.
 <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome.
 <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome is the manifestation of glucocorticoid excess.
It can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol.
Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent.
The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH.
The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.
Primary aldosteronism.
When the zona glomerulosa produces excess aldosterone, the result is primary aldosteronism.
Causes for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia of the glands and aldosterone-producing adenomas, which is called Conn's syndrome.
Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, increasing potassium depletion and sodium retention.
Adrenal insufficiency.
 <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
 <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease refers to primary hypoadrenalism, which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid production.
In the Western world,  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease is more commonly autoimmune, where the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex.
Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis.
A distinctive feature of  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.
An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and an array of nonspecific symptoms such as vomiting and fever.
An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma.
Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency.
Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when a part of the body is affected by a condition that impairs the production of hormones in the adrenal cortex.
The most common cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is a pituitary adenoma, which may affect the ability of the pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
This hormone is vital in the event of physiological stress, as it stimulates the adrenal glands into action: if absent, this action will not occur and an Addisonian crisis may follow unless an emergency hydrocortisone injection is given.
Tertiary adrenal insufficiency results from a deficiency in the production of CRH (produced by the hypothalamus).
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a congenital disease in which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis.
In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis.
As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other corticosteroids instead.
The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens.
Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.
Adrenal tumors.
Adrenal tumors are commonly found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging.
They are seen in around 3.4% of CT scans, and in most cases they are benign adenomas.
Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.
Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that arise from chromaffin cells.
They can produce a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety and palpitations.
Common signs include hypertension and tachycardia.
Surgery, especially adrenal laparoscopy, is the most common treatment for small pheochromocytomas.
History.
 <START:person> Bartolomeo Eustachi <END> , an Italian anatomist, is credited with the first description of the adrenal glands in 1564.
One of the most recognized works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 with the publication of "On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule", by the English physician  <START:person> Thomas Addison <END> .
In his monography,  <START:person> Addison <END>  described what the French physician  <START:person> George Trousseau <END>  would later name  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations.
In 1894, English physiologists  <START:person> George Oliver <END>  and  <START:person> Edward Schafer <END>  studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects.
In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts form the adrenal cortex to treat  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
 <START:person> Edward Calvin Kendall <END> ,  <START:person> Philip Hench <END>  and  <START:person> Tadeusz Reichstein <END>  were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the isolation of cortisone from the adrenal cortex.
Etymology.
The adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys.
The term "adrenal" comes from "ad-" (Latin, "near") and "renes" (Latin, "kidney").
Similarly, "suprarenal" is derived from "supra-" (Latin, "above") and "renes".
 <START:person> Alfonso Leng  Alfonso Leng Haygus <END>  (11 February 1884 – 11 November 1974) was a post-romantic composer of classical music.
He was born in Santiago, Chile.
He wrote the first important symphonic work in Chilean tradition, "La Muerte de Alcino", a symphonic poem inspired by the novel of  <START:person> Pedro Prado <END> .
He composed many art songs in different languages and important piano pieces, like the five "Doloras" (1914), which he later orchestrated and are normally played in concerts in Chile and Latin America.
He won the Nacional Art Prize in 1957.
 <START:person> Leng <END>  was also an accomplished dentist in Santiago.
As a dentist, he was the main founder of the dentistry faculty of the Universidad de Chile, and he was eventually elected as the first dean.
 <START:person> Leng <END>  was the nephew of composer  <START:person> Carmela Mackenna <END> .
AD (disambiguation)  An ad (advertisement) is a form of marketing communication.
AD ("Anno Domini") is a designation used to label years following 1 BC in the  <START:person> Julian <END>  and Gregorian calendars.
AD, A.D. or Ad may also refer to: People.
People nicknamed "AD" or "A.D." include: "Ad" can also refer to:  Adamic language  The Adamic language is, according to Jews (as recorded in the "midrashim") and some Christians, the language spoken by  <START:person> Adam <END>  (and possibly Eve) in the Garden of Eden.
It is variously interpreted as either the language used by God to address  <START:person> Adam <END>  (the divine language), or the language invented by  <START:person> Adam <END>  with which he named all things (including Eve), as in .
Medieval.
Traditional Jewish exegesis such as Midrash ( <START:person> Genesis Rabbah <END>  38) says that  <START:person> Adam <END>  spoke Hebrew because the names he gives Eve – ""Isha" (Book of Genesis 2:23) and "Chava"" (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew.
By contrast,  <START:person> Kabbalism <END>  assumed an "eternal Torah" which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew.
Thus,  <START:person> Abulafia <END>  in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in Paradise had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.
Eco (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of  <START:person> Adam <END>  was preserved by  <START:person> Adam <END> 's descendants until the confusion of tongues (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).
 <START:person> Dante <END>  addresses the topic in his "De Vulgari Eloquentia".
He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.
He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to  <START:person> Eve <END> , addressing the serpent, and not to  <START:person> Adam <END> .
In his "Divina Commedia", however,  <START:person> Dante <END>  changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise.
 <START:person> Dante <END>  concludes ("Paradiso" XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, "El", must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which  <START:person> Dante <END>  gives as "I".
Early Modern.
Elizabethan scholar  <START:person> John Dee <END>  makes references to an occult or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of spirit medium  <START:person> Edward Kelley <END> .
 <START:person> Dee <END> 's journals did not describe the language as "Enochian", instead preferring "Angelical", the "Celestial Speech", the "Language of Angels", the "First Language of God-Christ", the "Holy Language", or "Adamical" because, according to  <START:person> Dee <END> 's Angels, it was used by  <START:person> Adam <END>  in Paradise to name all things.
The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to  <START:person> Dee <END> 's assertion that the Biblical Patriarch  <START:person> Enoch <END>  had been the last human (before  <START:person> Dee <END>  and  <START:person> Kelley <END> ) to know the language.
Modern.
Latter Day Saint movement.
 <START:person> Joseph Smith <END> , founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, in his revision of the Bible, declared the Adamic language to have been "pure and undefiled".
Some Latter Day Saints believe it to be the language of God.
Glossolalia, or speaking in tongues, was commonplace in the early years of the LDS Church, and it was commonly believed that the incomprehensible language spoken during these incidents was the language of  <START:person> Adam <END>  though this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted.
Some other early Latter Day Saint leaders, including Brigham Young,  <START:person> Orson Pratt <END> , and  <START:person> Elizabeth Ann Whitney <END> , claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language by revelation.
Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the "pure language" spoken of by  <START:person> Zephaniah <END>  and that it will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world.
Apostle  <START:person> Orson Pratt <END>  declared that "Ahman", part of the name of the settlement "Adam-ondi-Ahman" in Daviess County, Missouri, was the name of God in the Adamic language.
An 1832 handwritten page from the  <START:person> Joseph Smith <END>  Papers, titled "A Sample of the Pure Language", and reportedly dictated by  <START:person> Smith <END>  to "Br.
 <START:person> Johnson <END> ", asserts that the name of God is "Awmen".
The Latter Day Saint endowment prayer circle once included use of the words "Pay Lay Ale".
These untranslated words are no longer used in temple ordinances and have been replaced by an English version, "O God, hear the words of my mouth".
Some believe that the "Pay Lay Ale" sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase "pe le-El", פה לאל "mouth to God".
Other words thought by some Latter Day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include "deseret" ("honey bee"), see Ether and "Ahman" ("God") see Doctrine and Covenants  The Book of Moses refers to "a book of remembrance" written in the language of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
 <START:person> Avery Hopwood  James Avery Hopwood <END>  (May 28, 1882 July 1, 1928), was an American playwright, called the most successful playwright of the Jazz Age, having four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920.
Biography.
He was born in Cleveland, Ohio and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Michigan (1905).
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, "Clothes" (1906), produced on Broadway.
He became known as "The Playboy Playwright" and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué at the time.
One play, "The Demi-Virgin" in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, "Stripping Cupid", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie.
The case was dismissed.
Dramatist.
His many plays included "Nobody's Widow" (1910), starring  <START:person> Blanche Bates <END> ; "Fair and Warmer" (1915), starring  <START:person> Madge Kennedy <END>  (filmed in 1919); "The Gold Diggers" (1919), starring  <START:person> Ina Claire <END>  (filmed in 1923 as "The Gold Diggers", in 1928 as "Gold Diggers of Broadway" and also as "Gold Diggers of 1933"); "Ladies' Night", 1920, starring  <START:person> Charlie Ruggles <END>  (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play "The Bat" (with  <START:person> Mary Roberts Rinehart <END> ), 1920 (filmed in 1926 "The Bat", 1930 "The Bat Whispers," and 1959 "The Bat)"; "Getting  <START:person> Gertie <END> 's Garter" (with  <START:person> Wilson Collison <END> ), 1921, starring  <START:person> Hazel Dawn <END>  (filmed in 1927 and 1945); "The Demi-Virgin", 1921, also starring  <START:person> Dawn <END> ; "The Alarm Clock", 1923; "The Best People" (with  <START:person> David Gray <END> ), 1924 (filmed in 1925 and as "Fast and Loose" in 1930), the song-farce "Naughty Cinderella", 1925, starring  <START:person> Irene Bordoni <END>  and "The Garden of Eden" in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as "The Garden of Eden").
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  was asked to write the third act of  <START:person> Mary Roberts Rinehart <END> 's play; "The Bat".
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  collaborated with  <START:person> Rinehart <END>  to then work on the last act of the play in Sewickley and sometimes in New York.
Interestingly, the early sound film, "The Bat Whispers", played an influence on  <START:person> Bob Kane <END> 's  <START:person> Batman <END>  because the inspiration for  <START:person> Batman <END> 's costume came from the "mysterious Bat" character portrayed in the movie from 1930.
A clever, adroit, masterful craftsman who wrote to the tastes of his public,  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  was inexhaustible in his work ethic.
Although the press reported that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer  <START:person> Rose Rolanda <END>  in 1924,  <START:person> Hopwood <END> 's close friend  <START:person> Carl Van Vechten <END>  confirmed in later years that it was all a publicity stunt.
 <START:person> Rolanda <END>  would later marry caricaturist  <START:person> Miguel Covarrubias <END> .
Death.
While swimming at Juan-les-Pins on the French Riviera, July 1, 1928, he suffered a heart attack and died.
He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio, next to his mother,  <START:person> Jule <END> .
Hopwood Awards.
The terms of  <START:person> Hopwood <END> 's will left a substantial portion of his estate to his alma mater, the University of Michigan for the establishment of the  <START:person> Avery Hopwood <END>  and Jule Hopwood Creative Writing Awards.
The bequest stipulated: "It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged."
Famous  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  award winners include  <START:person> Robert Hayden <END> ,  <START:person> Marge Piercy <END> ,  <START:person> Arthur Miller <END> ,  <START:person> Betty Smith <END> ,  <START:person> Lawrence Kasdan <END> ,  <START:person> John Ciardi <END> ,  <START:person> Mary Gaitskill <END> ,  <START:person> Edmund White <END> ,  <START:person> Nancy Willard <END> ,  <START:person> Frank O’Hara <END> , and  <START:person> Steve Hamilton <END> .
Works.
"The Great Bordello".
Throughout his life,  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  worked on a novel that he hoped would "expose" the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published.
 <START:person> Jack Sharrar <END>  recovered the manuscript for this novel in 1982 during his research for " <START:person> Avery Hopwood <END> , His Life and Plays".
The novel was published in July 2011 as "The Great Bordello".
Adventism  Adventism is a branch of Protestantism which began in the 19th century in the context of the Second Great Awakening revival in the United States.
The name refers to belief in the imminent Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END> .
 <START:person> William Miller <END>  started the Adventist movement in the 1830s.
His followers became known as Millerites.
Although the Adventist churches hold much in common, their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of refers to the one in heaven or one on earth.
The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible, leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath.
The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs (1980 and 2005), which use Biblical references as justification.
In 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches.
The largest church within the movement — the Seventh-day Adventist Church — has more than 18 million members.
History.
Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement.
Its most vocal leader was  <START:person> William Miller <END> .
Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported  <START:person> Miller <END> 's predictions of  <START:person> Christ <END> 's return.
After the "Great Disappointment" of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.
Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (second coming of  <START:person> Jesus <END> ).
Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that  <START:person> Jesus <END>  had come not literally but "spiritually", and consequently were known as "spiritualizers".
A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted.
This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.
Albany Conference (1845).
The Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement.
Following this meeting, the "Millerites" then became known as "Adventists" or "Second Adventists".
However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.
Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the Advent Christian Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
The largest group was organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church.
Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death.
They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies.
It has diminished to almost non-existence today.
Their main publication was the "Advent Herald", of which  <START:person> Sylvester Bliss <END>  was the editor until his death in 1863.
It was later called the "Messiah’s Herald".
The Life and Advent Union was founded by  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  in 1863.
He had established "The Bible Examiner" in 1842.
It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964.
The Advent Christian Church officially formed in 1861, and grew rapidly at first.
It declined a little during the 20th century.
The Advent Christians publish the four magazines "The Advent Christian Witness", "Advent Christian News", "Advent Christian Missions" and "Maranatha".
They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a one-year Bible College in Lenox, Massachusetts called Berkshire Institute for Christian Studies.
The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church officially formed in 1863.
It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.
It published the "Adventist Review, Kids Review, and Sabbath Herald".
It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.
 <START:person> Miller <END>  did not join any of the movements, and he spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.
Denominations.
The "Handbook of Denominations in the United States", 12th edn., describes the following churches as "Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches": Christadelphians.
The Christadelphians were founded in 1844 by  <START:person> John Thomas <END>  and had an estimated 25,000 members in 170 ecclesias, or churches, in 2000 in America.
Advent Christian Church.
The Advent Christian Church was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America.
It is a "first-day" body of Adventist Christians founded on the teachings of  <START:person> William Miller <END> .
It adopted the "conditional immortality" views of  <START:person> Charles F. Hudson <END>  and  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  who formed the "Advent Christian Association" in Salem, Massachusetts in 1860.
Primitive Advent Christian Church.
The Primitive Advent Christian Church is a small group which separated from the Advent Christian Church.
It differs from the parent body mainly on two points.
Its members observe foot washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized).
This is sometimes referred to as rebaptism.
Seventh-day Adventist.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, founded in 1863, had over 17,210,000 baptized members (not counting children of members) worldwide as of 2011.
It is best known for its teaching that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the Sabbath and is the appropriate day for worship.
However, it is the second coming of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  along with the Judgement day, based on the three angels message in Revelation 14: 6-13, that is the main doctrine of SDA.
Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement.
The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members from the Seventh-day Adventist Church caused by disagreement over military service on the Sabbath day during World War I. Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association.
The Davidians (originally named  <START:person> Shepherd <END> 's Rod) is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members made up primarily of voluntarily disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
They were originally known as the Shepherd's Rod and are still sometimes referred to as such.
The group derives its name from two books on Bible doctrine written by its founder,  <START:person> Victor Houteff <END> , in 1929.
Branch Davidians.
The Branch Davidians were a split ("branch") from the Davidians.
Many of them were killed during the infamous Waco Siege of April 1993.
Church of God (Seventh Day).
The Church of God (Seventh-Day) was founded in 1863 and it had an estimated 11,000 members in 185 churches in 1999 in America.
Its founding members separated in 1858 from those Adventists associated with  <START:person> Ellen G. White <END>  who later organized themselves as Seventh-day Adventists in 1863.
The Church of God (Seventh Day) split in 1933, creating two bodies: one headquartered in Salem, West Virginia, and known as the Church of God (7th day) Salem Conference and the other one headquartered in Denver, Colorado and known as the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day).
The Worldwide Church of God splintered from this.
Church of God and Saints of  <START:person> Christ <END> .
The Church of God and Saints of  <START:person> Christ <END>  was founded in 1896 and had an estimated 40,000 members in approximately 200 congregations in 1999 in America.
Church of God General Conference.
Many denominations known as "Church of God" have Adventist origins.
The Church of God General Conference was founded in 1921 and had 7,634 members in 162 churches in 2004 in America.
It is an Adventist Christian body which is also known as the "Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith" and the "Church of God General Conference ( <START:person> Morrow <END> , GA)".
Creation Seventh-Day Adventist.
Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church United Seventh-Day Brethren.
The United Seventh-Day Brethren is a small Sabbatarian Adventist body.
In 1947, several individuals and two independent congregations within the Church of God Adventist movement formed the "United Seventh-Day Brethren", seeking to increase fellowship and to combine their efforts in evangelism, publications, and other .
Other relationships.
The Bible Students movement founded by  <START:person> Charles Taze Russell <END>  had in its early development close connections with the Millerite movement and stalwarts of the Adventist faith, including  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  and  <START:person> Joseph Seiss <END> .
The various groupings of Bible Students currently have a cumulative membership of less than 20,000 worldwide.
Although  <START:person> Jehovah <END> 's Witnesses and Bible Students do not categorize themselves as part of the Millerite Adventist movement (or other denominations, in general), some theologians do categorize the group and schisms as Millerite Adventist because of its teachings regarding an imminent Second Coming and use of specific dates.
As of January 2014 there are approximately 8 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.
High Sabbath Adventists are a group of Seventh-day Adventists who believe in the prophetic significance of the High Sabbaths.
They are Historic Adventists who believe that God has been giving the light of the fourth angel (of Revelation 18) in the form of the Orion Message since 2010.

General:  American Football League  The American Football League (AFL) was a major professional American football league that operated from 1960 until 1969, when it merged with the National Football League (NFL).
The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence.
The AFL was created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises.
The AFL's original lineup saw an Eastern division of the New York Titans, Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers along with a Western division of the Los Angeles Chargers, Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders, and Dallas Texans.
The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960, including Houston's successful signing of All-American  <START:person> Billy Cannon <END> .
While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance, the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with ABC (followed by a contract with NBC for games starting with the 1965 season) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide.
Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, as well as successful franchise shifts to San Diego (from LA) and Kansas City (from Dallas), the AFL established a dedicated following.
The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league's reputation among the major media.
As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues, especially after a series of "raids," the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966.
Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions, which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl.
The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game.
During this time the AFL added the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals.
After losses by Kansas City and Oakland in the first two AFL-NFL Championship Games to the Green Bay Packers, the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowls III and IV, cementing the league's claim to being an equal to the NFL.
In 1970, the AFL was absorbed into the NFL, and the ten AFL franchises along with the Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers became the American Football Conference.
League history.
During the 1950s, the National Football League had grown to rival Major League Baseball as one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States.
One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the Chicago Cardinals, owned by the  <START:person> Bidwill <END>  family, who had become overshadowed by the more popular Chicago Bears.
The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to St. Louis but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee.
Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END> , son and heir of Texas millionaire oilman  <START:person> H. L. Hunt <END> .
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to Dallas, Texas, where he had grown up.
However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a previous NFL franchise had failed in 1952.
While Hunt negotiated with Bidwills, similar offers were made by  <START:person> Bud Adams <END> ,  <START:person> Bob Howsam <END> , and  <START:person> Max Winter <END> .
When  <START:person> Hunt <END> ,  <START:person> Adams <END> , and  <START:person> Howsam <END>  were unable to secure a controlling interest in the Chicago Cardinals, they approached NFL commissioner  <START:person> Bert Bell <END>  and proposed the addition of expansion teams.
Bell, wary of expanding the 12-team league and risking its newfound success, rejected the offer.
On his return flight to Dallas,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  conceived the idea of an entirely new league and decided to contact the others who had shown interest in purchasing the Cardinals.
He contacted  <START:person> Adams <END> ,  <START:person> Howsam <END> , and Winter (as well as Winter's business partner,  <START:person> Bill Boyer <END> ) to gauge their interest in starting a new league.
 <START:person> Hunt <END> 's first meeting with  <START:person> Adams <END>  was held in March 1959.
Hunt, who felt a regional rivalry would be critical for the success of the new league, convinced  <START:person> Adams <END>  to join and found his team in Houston.
Hunt next secured an agreement from  <START:person> Howsam <END>  to bring a team to Denver, Colorado.
After Winter and  <START:person> Boyer <END>  agreed to start a team in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, the new league had its first four teams.
Hunt then approached  <START:person> Willard Rhodes <END> , who hoped to bring pro football to Seattle, Washington.
However, the University of Washington was unwilling to let the fledgling league use Husky Stadium, probably due to the excessive wear and tear that would have caused to the facility's grass surface.
With no place for his team to play,  <START:person> Rhodes <END> ' effort came to nothing.
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  also sought franchises in Los Angeles, California; Buffalo and New York City.
During the summer of 1959 he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a potentially costly rivalry.
Within weeks of the July 1959 announcement of the league's formation,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  received commitments from Barron Hilton and  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END>  to bring teams to Los Angeles and New York, respectively.
His initial efforts for Buffalo, However, were rebuffed, when  <START:person> Hunt <END> 's first choice of owner,  <START:person> Pat McGroder <END> , declined to take part;  <START:person> McGroder <END>  had hoped that the threat of the AFL would be enough to prompt the NFL to expand to Buffalo.
On August 14, 1959, the first league meeting was held in Chicago, Illinois, and charter memberships were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, and  <START:person> Minneapolis-Saint Paul <END> .
On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League.
The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier All-America Football Conference (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league.
AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones.
Only the party from Minneapolis accepted, and the Minnesota group joined the NFL the next year in 1961; the Minneapolis group joined Ole Haugsrud in the new NFL team's ownership group, with Haugsrud dubbing the team the Minnesota Vikings.
The older league also announced on August 29 that it had conveniently reversed its position against expansion, and planned to bring NFL expansion teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961.
(The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team – the Dallas Cowboys – actually started play in 1960, and the  <START:person> Vikings <END>  began play in 1961.)
Finally, the NFL quickly came to terms with the Bidwills and allowed them to relocate the struggling Cardinals to St. Louis, eliminating that city as a potential AFL market.
 <START:person> Ralph Wilson <END> , who owned a minority interest in the NFL's Detroit Lions at the time, initially announced he was placing a team in Miami, Florida, but like the Seattle situation, was also rebuffed by local ownership; given five other choices,  <START:person> Wilson <END>  negotiated with  <START:person> McGroder <END>  and brought the team that would become the Bills to Buffalo.
Buffalo was officially awarded its franchise on October 28.
During a league meeting on November 22, a 10-man ownership group from Boston, Massachusetts (led by  <START:person> Billy Sullivan <END> ) was awarded the AFL's eighth team.
On November 30, 1959,  <START:person> Joe Foss <END> , a World War II Marine fighter ace and former governor of South Dakota, was named the AFL's first commissioner.
 <START:person> Foss <END>  commissioned a friend of  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END> 's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo.
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  was elected President of the AFL on January 26, 1960.
The AFL Draft.
The AFL's first draft took place the same day Boston was awarded its franchise, and lasted 33 rounds.
The league held a second draft on December 2, which lasted for 20 rounds.
Because the Raiders joined after the AFL draft, they inherited Minnesota's selections.
A special "allocation draft" was held in January 1960, to allow the Raiders to stock their team, as some of the other AFL teams had already signed some of Minneapolis' original draft choices.
Crisis and success (1960–61).
In November 1959, Minneapolis owner  <START:person> Max Winter <END>  announced his intent to leave the AFL to accept a franchise offer from the NFL.
In 1961, his team began play in the NFL as the Minnesota Vikings.
Los Angeles Chargers owner  <START:person> Barron Hilton <END>  demanded that a replacement for Minnesota be placed in California, to reduce his team's operating costs and to create a rivalry.
After a brief search, Oakland was chosen and an ownership group led by F. Wayne Valley and local real estate developer  <START:person> Chet Soda <END>  was formed.
After initially being called the Oakland "Señores", the Oakland Raiders officially joined the AFL on January 30, 1960.
The AFL's first major success came when the Houston Oilers signed  <START:person> Billy Cannon <END> , the All-American and 1959 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU.  <START:person> Cannon <END>  signed a $100,000 contract to play for the Oilers, despite having already signed a $50,000 contract with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams.
The Oilers filed suit and claimed that Rams general manager  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  had unduly manipulated Cannon.
The court upheld the Houston contract, and with Cannon the Oilers appeared in the AFL's first three championship games (winning two).
On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with ABC, which brought in revenues of approximately $2,125,000 per year for the entire league.
On June 17, the AFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, which was dismissed in 1962 after a two-month trial.
The AFL began regular-season play (a night game on Friday, September 9, 1960) with eight teams in the league — the Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Dallas Texans, Denver Broncos, Houston Oilers, Los Angeles Chargers, New York Titans, and Oakland Raiders.
Raiders' co-owner  <START:person> Wayne Valley <END>  dubbed the AFL ownership "The Foolish Club," a term  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  subsequently used on team photographs he sent as Christmas gifts.
The Oilers became the first-ever league champions by defeating the Chargers, 24–16, in the AFL Championship on January 1, 1961.
Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable for a new league, but not nearly that of the NFL.
Whereas the more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures in excess of 50,000 per game, AFL attendance generally hovered between 10,000-20,000 per game.
With the low attendance came financial losses.
The Raiders, for instance, lost $500,000 in their first year and only survived after receiving a $400,000 loan from Bills owner  <START:person> Ralph Wilson <END> .
In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation.
In fact, the only major change was the relocation of the Chargers from Los Angeles to nearby San Diego.
On August 8, 1961, the AFL challenged the Canadian Football League to an exhibition game that would feature the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the Buffalo Bills.
Playing at Civic Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario, the Ticats defeated the Bills 38–21 playing a mix of AFL and CFL rules.
Movement and instability (1962–63).
While the Oilers found instant success in the AFL, other teams did not fare as well.
The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans struggled on and off the field during their first few seasons in the league.
Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses their first season.
Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the team playing in the San Francisco Bay Area—which already had an established NFL team (the San Francisco 49ers)—but the product on the field was also to blame.
After winning six games their debut season, the Raiders won a total of three times in the 1961 and 1962 seasons.
Oakland took part in a 1961 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did little good.
They participated in another such draft in 1962.
The Titans fared a little better on the field but had their own financial troubles.
Attendance was so low for home games that team owner  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END>  had fans move to seats closer to the field to give the illusion of a fuller stadium on television.
Eventually  <START:person> Wismer <END>  could no longer afford to meet his payroll, and on November 8, 1962 the AFL took over operations of the team.
The Titans were sold to a five-person ownership group headed by  <START:person> Sonny Werblin <END>  on March 28, 1963, and in April the new owners changed the team's name to the New York Jets.
The Raiders and Titans both finished last in their respective divisions in the 1962 season.
The Texans and Oilers, winners of their divisions, faced each other for the 1962 AFL Championship on December 23.
The Texans dethroned the two-time champion Oilers, 20–17, in a double-overtime contest that was, at the time, professional football's longest-ever game.
In 1963, the Texans became the second AFL team to relocate.
 <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  felt that despite winning the league championship in 1962, the Texans could not succeed financially competing in the same market as the Dallas Cowboys, which entered the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1960.
After meetings with New Orleans, Atlanta, and Miami,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  announced on May 22 that the Texans' new home would be Kansas City, Missouri.
Kansas City mayor  <START:person> Harold Roe Bartle <END>  (nicknamed "Chief") was instrumental in his city's success in attracting the team.
Partly to honor  <START:person> Bartle <END> , the franchise officially became the Kansas City Chiefs on May 26.
The San Diego Chargers, under head coach  <START:person> Sid Gillman <END> , won a decisive 51–10 victory over the Boston Patriots for the 1963 AFL Championship.
Confident that his team was capable of beating the NFL-champion Chicago Bears (he had the Chargers' rings inscribed with the phrase "World Champions"),  <START:person> Gillman <END>  approached NFL Commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  and proposed a final championship game between the two teams.
 <START:person> Rozelle <END>  declined the offer; however, the game would be instituted three seasons later.
Watershed years (1964–65).
A series of events throughout the next few years demonstrated the AFL's ability to achieve a greater level of equality with the NFL.
On January 29, 1964, the AFL signed a lucrative $36 million television contract with NBC (beginning in the 1965 season), which gave the league money it needed to compete with the NFL for players.
An NFL owner was quoted as saying to NFL Commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  that "They don't have to call us 'Mister' anymore".
A single-game attendance record was set on November 8, 1964, when 61,929 fans packed Shea Stadium to watch the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.
The bidding war for players between the AFL and NFL escalated in 1965.
The Chiefs drafted University of Kansas star  <START:person> Gale Sayers <END>  in the first round of the 1965 AFL draft (held November 28, 1964), while the Chicago Bears did the same in the NFL draft.
 <START:person> Sayers <END>  eventually signed with the Bears.
A similar situation occurred when the New York Jets and the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals both drafted University of Alabama quarterback  <START:person> Joe Namath <END> .
In what was viewed as a key victory for the AFL,  <START:person> Namath <END>  signed a $427,000 contract with the Jets on January 2, 1965 (the deal included a new car).
It was the highest amount of money ever paid to a collegiate football player, and is cited as the strongest contributing factor to the eventual merger between the two leagues.
In early 1965, the AFL considered adding its first expansion team, to begin play in Atlanta in 1966.
An AFL franchise was awarded to  <START:person> Rankin Smith <END>  of that city.
The NFL quickly offered  <START:person> Smith <END>  a franchise, which  <START:person> Smith <END>  accepted.
In March 1965,  <START:person> Joe Robbie <END>  had met with Commissioner  <START:person> Foss <END>  to inquire about an expansion franchise for Miami, Florida.
On May 6, after Atlanta's exit,  <START:person> Robbie <END>  secured an agreement with Miami mayor  <START:person> Robert King Higho <END>  to bring a team to Miami.
League expansion was approved at a meeting held on June 7, and on August 16 the AFL's ninth franchise was officially awarded to  <START:person> Robbie <END>  and television star  <START:person> Danny Thomas <END> .
The Miami Dolphins joined the league for a fee of $7.5 million and started play in the AFL's Eastern Division in 1966.
Escalation and merger (1966–67).
In 1966, the rivalry between the AFL and NFL reached an all-time peak.
On April 7,  <START:person> Joe Foss <END>  resigned as AFL commissioner.
His successor was Oakland Raiders head coach and general manager  <START:person> Al Davis <END> , who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise.
No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under  <START:person> Davis <END>  started to recruit players already on NFL squads.
 <START:person> Davis <END> 's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL.
Although  <START:person> Davis <END> 's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues.
Alarmed with the rate of spending in the league, Hilton Hotels forced  <START:person> Barron Hilton <END>  to relinquish his stake in the Chargers as a condition of maintaining his leadership role with the hotel chain.
The same month  <START:person> Davis <END>  was named commissioner, several NFL owners, along with Dallas Cowboys general manager  <START:person> Tex Schramm <END> , secretly approached  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  and other AFL owners and asked the AFL to merge.
They held a series of secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching.
Hunt and  <START:person> Schramm <END>  completed the basic groundwork for a merger of the two leagues by the end of May, and on June 8, 1966, the merger was officially announced.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft.
The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues.
The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, NFL commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  would remain as commissioner of the merged league, and additional expansion teams would eventually be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring it to a 28-team league.
The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years.
In protest,  <START:person> Davis <END>  resigned as AFL commissioner on July 25 rather than remain until the completion of the merger, and  <START:person> Milt Woodard <END>  was named President of the AFL.
On January 15, 1967, the first-ever World Championship Game between the champions of the two separate professional football leagues, the AFL-NFL Championship Game (retroactively referred to as Super Bowl I), was played in Los Angeles.
After a close first half, the NFL champion Green Bay Packers overwhelmed the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs, 35–10.
The loss reinforced for many the notion that the AFL was an inferior league.
Packers head coach  <START:person> Vince Lombardi <END>  stated after the game, "I do not think they are as good as the top teams in the National Football League."
The second AFL-NFL Championship (Super Bowl II) yielded a similar result.
The Oakland Raiders—who had easily beaten the Houston Oilers to win their first AFL championship—were overmatched by the Packers, 33–14.
The more experienced Packers capitalized on a number of Raiders miscues and never trailed.
Green Bay defensive tackle  <START:person> Henry Jordan <END>  offered a compliment to Oakland and the AFL, when he said, "... the AFL is becoming much more sophisticated on offense.
I think the league has always had good personnel, but the blocks were subtler and better conceived in this game."
The AFL added its tenth and final team on May 24, 1967, when it awarded the league's second expansion franchise to an ownership group from Cincinnati, Ohio, headed by NFL legend  <START:person> Paul Brown <END> .
Although  <START:person> Brown <END>  had intended to join the NFL, he agreed to join the AFL when he learned that his team would be included in the NFL once the merger was completed.
The Cincinnati Bengals began play in the 1968 season, finishing last in the Western Division.
Legitimacy and the end of an era (1968–70).
While many AFL players and observers believed their league was the equal of the NFL, their first two Super Bowl performances did nothing to prove it.
However, on November 17, 1968, when NBC cut away from a game between the Jets and Raiders to air the children's movie " <START:person> Heidi <END> ," the ensuing uproar helped disprove the notion that fans still considered the AFL an inferior product.
The perception of AFL inferiority forever changed on January 12, 1969, when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.
The Colts, who entered the contest favored by as many as 18 points, had completed the 1968 NFL season with a 13–1 record, and won the NFL title with a convincing 34–0 win over the Cleveland Browns.
Led by their stalwart defense—which allowed a record-low 144 points—the 1968 Colts were considered one of the best-ever NFL teams.
By contrast, the Jets had allowed 280 points, the highest total for any division winner in the two leagues.
They had also only narrowly beaten the favored Oakland Raiders 27–23 in the AFL championship game.
Jets quarterback  <START:person> Joe Namath <END>  recalled that in the days leading up to the game, he grew increasingly angry when told New York had no chance to beat Baltimore.
Three days before the game, a frustrated  <START:person> Namath <END>  responded to a heckler at the Touchdown Club in Miami by declaring, "We're going to win Sunday, I'll guarantee you."
 <START:person> Namath <END>  and the Jets made good on his guarantee as they held the Colts scoreless until late in the fourth quarter.
The Jets won, 16–7, in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in American sports history.
With the win, the AFL finally achieved parity with the NFL and legitimized the merger of the two leagues.
That notion was reinforced one year later in Super Bowl IV, when the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs upset the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings, 23–7, in the last championship game to be played between the two leagues.
The  <START:person> Vikings <END> , favored by 12½ points, were held to just 67 rushing yards.
The last game in AFL history was the AFL All-Star Game, held in Houston's Astrodome on January 17, 1970.
The Western All-Stars, led by Chargers quarterback  <START:person> John Hadl <END> , defeated the Eastern All-Stars, 26–3.
 <START:person> Hadl <END>  was named the game's Most Valuable Player.
Prior to the start of the 1970 NFL season, the merged league was organized into two conferences of three divisions each.
All ten AFL teams made up the bulk of the new American Football Conference.
To avoid having an inequitable number of teams in each conference, the leagues voted to move three NFL teams to the AFC.
Motivated by the prospect of an intrastate rivalry with the Bengals as well as by personal animosity toward  <START:person> Paul Brown <END> , Cleveland Browns owner  <START:person> Art Modell <END>  quickly offered to include his team in the AFC.
He helped persuade the Pittsburgh Steelers (the Browns' archrivals) and Baltimore Colts (who shared the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. market with the Washington Redskins) to follow suit, and each team received US $3 million to make the switch.
All the other NFL squads became part of the National Football Conference.
Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver  <START:person> Charlie Joiner <END> , who started his career with the Houston Oilers (1969), was the last AFL player active in professional football, retiring after the 1986 season, when he played for the San Diego Chargers.
Legacy.
Overview.
The American Football League stands as the only professional football league to successfully compete against the NFL.
When the two leagues merged in 1970, all ten AFL franchises and their statistics became part of the new NFL.
Every other professional league that had competed against the NFL before the AFL-NFL merger had folded completely: the three previous leagues named "American Football League" and the All-America Football Conference.
From an earlier AFL (1936–1937), only the Cleveland Rams (now the St. Louis Rams) joined the NFL and are currently operating, as are the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers from the AAFC.
A third AAFC team, the Baltimore Colts (not related to the 1953–1983 Baltimore Colts or to the current Indianapolis Colts franchise), played only one year in the NFL, disbanding at the end of the 1950 season.
The league resulting from the merger was a 26-team juggernaut (since expanded to 32) with television rights covering all of the Big Three television networks and teams in close proximity to almost all of the top 40 metropolitan areas, a fact that has precluded any other competing league from gaining traction since the merger; failed attempts to mimic the AFL's success included the World Football League (1974–75), United States Football League (1983–85), XFL (2001) and United Football League (2009–2012).
The AFL was also the most successful of numerous upstart leagues of the 1960s and 1970s that attempted to challenge a major professional league's dominance.
All nine teams that were in the AFL at the time the merger was agreed upon were accepted into the league intact (as was the tenth team added between the time of the merger's agreement and finalization).
For comparison, the World Hockey Association (1972–79) managed to have four of its six remaining teams merged into the National Hockey League, which actually caused the older league to contract a franchise, but WHA teams were forced to disperse the majority of their rosters and restart as expansion teams.
The merged WHA teams were also not financially sound, as three of the four were forced to relocate within 20 years.
The American Basketball Association (1967–76) managed to have only four of its teams merged into the National Basketball Association, and the rest of the league was forced to fold.
The Continental League, a proposed third league for Major League Baseball that was to begin play in 1961, never played a single game.
Rule changes.
The NFL adopted some of the innovations introduced by the AFL immediately and a few others in the years following the merger.
One was including the names on player jerseys.
The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a stopwatch used by the referee.
The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960.
The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it.
The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s).
All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the "AFL" than like the old-line NFL.
The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.
Television.
The NFL also adapted how the AFL used the growing power of televised football games, which were bolstered with the help of major network contracts (first with ABC and later with NBC).
With that first contract with ABC, the AFL adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds were divided equally among member clubs.
It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the Dallas Texans and the defending champion Houston Oilers.
At the time it was the longest professional football championship game ever played.
The AFL also appealed to fans by offering a flashier style of play (just like the ABA in basketball), compared to the more conservative game of the NFL.
Long passes ("bombs") were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as  <START:person> John Hadl <END> ,  <START:person> Daryle Lamonica <END>  and  <START:person> Len Dawson <END> .
Despite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks.
For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL.
It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.
Expanding and reintroducing the sport to more cities.
The AFL took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises.
 <START:person> Hunt <END> 's vision not only brought a new professional football league to California and New York, but introduced the sport to Colorado, restored it to Texas and later to fast-growing Florida, as well as bringing it to New England for the first time in 12 years.
Buffalo, having lost its original NFL franchise in 1929 and turned down by the NFL at least twice (1940 and 1950) for a replacement, returned to the NFL with the merger.
The return of football to Kansas City was the first time that city had seen professional football since the NFL's Kansas City Blues/Cowboys of the 1920s; the arrival of the Chiefs, and the contemporary arrival of the St. Louis Football Cardinals, brought professional football back to Missouri for the first time since the temporary St. Louis Gunners of 1934.
If not for the AFL, at least 17 of today's NFL teams would probably never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and seven clubs that were instigated by the AFL's presence to some degree.
Three NFL franchises were awarded as a direct result of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Minnesota Vikings, who were awarded to  <START:person> Max Winter <END>  in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Atlanta Falcons, whose franchise went to  <START:person> Rankin Smith <END>  to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's Miami Dolphins; and the New Orleans Saints, because of successful anti-trust legislation which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians.
In the case of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL had long sought to return to the Dallas area after the Dallas Texans folded in 1952, but was originally met with strong opposition by Washington Redskins owner  <START:person> George Preston Marshall <END> , who had enjoyed a monopoly as the only NFL team to represent the American South.
 <START:person> Marshall <END>  later changed his position after future-Cowboys owner  <START:person> Clint Murchison <END>  bought the rights to Washington's fight song "Hail to the Redskins" and threatened to prevent  <START:person> Marshall <END>  from playing it at games.
By then, the NFL wanted to quickly award the new Dallas franchise to  <START:person> Murchison <END>  so the team could immediately begin play and complete with the AFL's Texans.
As a result, the Cowboys played its inaugural season in 1960 without the benefit of the NFL draft.
As part of the merger agreement, additional expansion teams would be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring the league to 28 franchises; this requirement was fulfilled when the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began play in 1976.
In addition, had it not been for the existence of the Oilers from 1960 to 1996, the Houston Texans also would likely not exist today; the 2002 expansion team restored professional football in Houston after the original charter AFL member Oilers relocated to become the Tennessee Titans.
 <START:person> Kevin Sherrington <END>  of "The Dallas Morning News" has argued that the presence of AFL and the subsequent merger radically altered the fortunes of the Pittsburgh Steelers, saving the team "from stinking".
Before the merger, the Steelers had long been one of the NFL's worst teams.
Constantly lacking the money to build a quality team, the Steelers had only posted eight winning seasons, and just one playoff appearance, since their first year of existence in 1933.
They also finished with a 1-13 record in 1969, tied with the Chicago Bears for the worst record in the NFL.
The $3 million indemnity that the Steelers received for joining the AFC with the rest of the former AFL teams after the merger helped them rebuild into a contender, drafting eventual-Pro Football Hall of Famers like  <START:person> Terry Bradshaw <END>  and  <START:person> Joe Greene <END> , and ultimately winning four Super Bowls in the 1970s.
Since the 1970 merger, the Steelers have the NFL's highest winning percentage, the most total victories, the most trips to either conference championship game, are tied with the Dallas Cowboys for the most trips to the Super Bowl, and have won an NFL-record six Super Bowl championships.
Effects on players.
Perhaps the greatest social legacy of the AFL was the domino effect of its policy of being more liberal than the entrenched NFL in offering opportunity for black players.
While the NFL was still emerging from thirty years of segregation influenced by Washington Redskins' owner  <START:person> George Preston Marshall <END> , the AFL actively recruited from small and predominantly black colleges.
The AFL's color-blindness led not only to the explosion of black talent on the field, but to the eventual entry of blacks into scouting, coordinating, and ultimately head coaching positions, long after the league ceased to exist.
The AFL's free agents came from several sources.
Some were players who could not find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the Canadian Football League.
In the late 1950s, many players released by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their luck with the CFL, and later returned to the states to play in the AFL.
In the league's first years, players such as Oilers'  <START:person> George Blanda <END> , Chargers/Bills'  <START:person> Jack Kemp <END> , Texans'  <START:person> Len Dawson <END> , the NY Titans'  <START:person> Don Maynard <END> , Raiders/Patriots/Jets'  <START:person> Babe Parilli <END> , Pats'  <START:person> Bob Dee <END>  proved to be AFL standouts.
Other players such as the Broncos'  <START:person> Frank Tripucka <END> , the Pats'  <START:person> Gino Cappelletti <END> , the Bills'  <START:person> Cookie Gilchrist <END>  and the Chargers' Tobin Rote,  <START:person> Sam DeLuca <END>  and  <START:person> Dave Kocourek <END>  also made their mark to give the fledgling league badly needed credibility.
Rounding out this mix of potential talent were the true "free agents", the walk-ons and the "wanna-be's", who tried out in droves for the chance to play professional American football.
After the AFL-NFL merger agreement in 1966, and after the AFL's Jets defeated the "best team in the history of the NFL", the Colts, a popular misconception fostered by the NFL and spread by media reports was that the AFL defeated the NFL because of the Common Draft instituted in 1967.
This apparently was meant to assert that the AFL could not achieve parity as long as it had to compete with the NFL in the draft.
But the 1968 Jets had less than a handful of "common draftees".
Their stars were honed in the AFL, many of them since the Titans days.
As noted below, the AFL got its share of stars long before the "common draft".
Players who chose the AFL to develop their talent included  <START:person> Lance Alworth <END>  and  <START:person> Ron Mix <END>  of the Chargers, who had also been drafted by the NFL's San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts respectively.
Both eventually were elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame after earning recognition during their careers as being among the best at their positions.
Among specific teams, the 1964 Buffalo Bills stood out by holding their opponents to a pro football record 913 yards rushing on 300 attempts, while also recording fifty quarterback sacks in a 14-game schedule.
Another example is cited by the University of Kansas website, which describes the 1961 Bluebonnet Bowl, won by  <START:person> KU <END> , and goes on to say "Two Kansas players, quarterback  <START:person> John Hadl <END>  and fullback  <START:person> Curtis McClinton <END> , signed professional contracts on the field immediately after the conclusion of the game.
 <START:person> Hadl <END>  inked a deal with the "[AFL]" San Diego Chargers, and  <START:person> McClinton <END>  went to the "[AFL]" Dallas Texans."
Between them, in their careers  <START:person> Hadl <END>  and  <START:person> McClinton <END>  combined for an American Football League Rookie of the Year award, seven AFL All-Star selections, two Pro Bowl selections, a team MVP award, two AFL All-Star Game MVP awards, two AFL championships, and a World Championship.
And these were players selected by the AFL long "before" the "Common Draft".
In 2009, a five-part series, "", on the "Showtime Network", refuted many of the long-held misconceptions about the AFL.
In it,  <START:person> Abner Haynes <END>  tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the  <START:person> Haynes <END>  home; the NFL Cowboys'  <START:person> Tex Schramm <END>  is quoted as saying that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's Dallas Texans, they would very likely have lost;  <START:person> George Blanda <END>  makes a case for more AFL players being inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of  <START:person> Famer Willie Brown <END>  was cut by the Houston Oilers because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker  <START:person> Charlie Hennigan <END>  in practice.
Later, when  <START:person> Brown <END>  was with the Broncos,  <START:person> Hennigan <END>  needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break  <START:person> Lionel Taylor <END> 's Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season.
 <START:person> Hennigan <END>  caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by  <START:person> Brown <END> :  <START:person> Blanda <END> 's point being that if  <START:person> Hennigan <END>  could do so well against a Hall of Fame db, he deserves induction, as well.
Influence on professional football coaching.
The AFL also spawned coaches whose style and techniques have profoundly affected the play of professional football to this day.
In addition to AFL greats like  <START:person> Hank Stram <END> ,  <START:person> Lou Saban <END> ,  <START:person> Sid Gillman <END>  and  <START:person> Al Davis <END>  were eventual hall of fame coaches such as  <START:person> Bill Walsh <END> , a protégé of  <START:person> Davis <END>  with the AFL Oakland Raiders for one season; and  <START:person> Chuck Noll <END> , who worked for  <START:person> Gillman <END>  and the AFL LA/San Diego Chargers from 1960 through 1965.
Others include  <START:person> Buddy Ryan <END>  (AFL's New York Jets),  <START:person> Chuck Knox <END>  (Jets),  <START:person> Walt Michaels <END>  (Jets), and  <START:person> John Madden <END>  (AFL's Oakland Raiders).
Additionally, many prominent coaches began their pro football careers as players in the AFL, including  <START:person> Sam Wyche <END>  (Cincinnati Bengals),  <START:person> Marty Schottenheimer <END>  (Buffalo Bills),  <START:person> Wayne Fontes <END>  (Jets), and two-time Super Bowl winner  <START:person> Tom Flores <END>  (Oakland Raiders).
 <START:person> Flores <END>  also has a Super Bowl ring as a player (1969 Kansas City Chiefs).
AFL 50th Anniversary Celebration.
As the influence of the AFL continues through the present, the 50th anniversary of its launch was celebrated during 2009.
The season-long celebration began in August with the 2009 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio between two AFC teams (as opposed to the AFC-vs-NFC format the game first adopted in 1971).
The opponents were two of the original AFL franchises, the Buffalo Bills and Tennessee Titans (the former Houston Oilers).
Bills' owner  <START:person> Ralph C. Wilson Jr. <END>  (a 2009 Hall of Fame inductee) and Titans' owner  <START:person> Bud Adams <END>  were the only surviving members of the Foolish Club, the eight original owners of AFL franchises.
The Hall of Fame Game was the first of several "Legacy Weekends," during which each of the "original eight" AFL teams sported uniforms from their AFL era.
Each of the 8 teams took part in at least two such "legacy" games.
On-field officials also wore red-and-white-striped AFL uniforms during these games.
In the fall of 2009, the Showtime pay-cable network premiered "", a 5-part documentary series produced by NFL Films that features vintage game film and interviews as well as more recent interviews with those associated with the AFL.
The NFL sanctioned a variety of "Legacy" gear to celebrate the AFL anniversary, such as "throwback" jerseys, T-shirts, signs, pennants and banners, including items with the logos and colors of the Dallas Texans, Houston Oilers, and New York Titans, the three of the Original Eight AFL teams which have changed names or venues.
A December 5, 2009 story by  <START:person> Ken Belson <END>  in the "New York Times" quotes league officials as stating that AFL "Legacy" gear made up twenty to thirty percent of the league's annual $3 billion merchandise income.
Fan favorites were the Denver Broncos' vertically striped socks, which could not be re-stocked quickly enough.
AFL franchises.
Today, two of the NFL's eight divisions are composed entirely of former AFL teams, the AFC West (Broncos, Chargers, Chiefs, and Raiders) and the AFC East (Bills, Dolphins, Jets, and Patriots).
Additionally, the Bengals now play in the AFC North and the Tennessee Titans (formerly the Oilers) play in the AFC South.
AFL playoffs.
From 1960 to 1968, the AFL determined its champion via a single-elimination playoff game between the winners of its two divisions.
The home teams alternated each year by division, so in 1968 the Jets hosted the Raiders, even though Oakland had a better record (this was changed in 1969).
In 1963, the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots finished tied with identical records of 7–6–1 in the AFL East Division.
There was no tie-breaker protocol in place, so a one-game playoff was held in War Memorial Stadium in December.
The visiting Patriots defeated the host Bills 26–8.
The Patriots traveled to San Diego as the Chargers completed a three-game season sweep over the weary Patriots with a 51–10 victory.
A similar situation occurred in the 1968 season, when the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs finished the regular season tied with identical records of 12–2 in the AFL West Division.
The Raiders beat the Chiefs 41–6 in a division playoff to qualify for the AFL Championship Game.
In 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, Professional Football's first "wild card" playoffs were conducted.
A four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other division.
The Chiefs upset the Raiders in Oakland 17–7 in the league's Championship, the final AFL game played.
The Kansas City Chiefs were the first Super Bowl champion to win two road playoff games and the first wildcard team to win the Super Bowl, although the term "wildcard" was coined by the media, and not used officially until several years later.
AFL Championship Games.
"Italics" – Super Bowl Appearance, Bold Super Bowl Victory AFL All-Star games.
The AFL did not play an All-Star game after its first season in 1960, but did stage All-Star games for the 1961 through 1969 seasons.
All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions played each other after every season except 1965.
That season, the league champion Buffalo Bills played all-stars from the other teams.
After the 1964 season, the AFL All-Star game had been scheduled for early 1965 in New Orleans' Tulane Stadium.
After numerous black players were refused service by a number of area hotels and businesses, black and white players alike called for a boycott.
Led by Bills players such as  <START:person> Cookie Gilchrist <END> , the players successfully lobbied to have the game moved to Houston's Jeppesen Stadium.
All-Time AFL Team.
As chosen by 1969 AFL Hall of Fame Selection Committee Members: AFL records.
The following is a sample of some records set during the existence of the league.
The NFL considers AFL statistics and records equivalent to its own.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer  Albrecht Dürer <END>  (; ]; 21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528) was a German painter, printmaker, mathematician, and theorist born in Nuremberg.
His high-quality woodcut prints established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, and he has been conventionally regarded as the greatest artist of the Northern Renaissance.
His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books.
The woodcuts, such as the "Apocalypse" series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work.
His well-known engravings include the "Knight, Death, and the Devil" (1513), "Saint  <START:person> Jerome <END>  in his Study" (1514) and "Melencolia I" (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation.
His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.
This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.
Early life (1471–90).
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had between fourteen and eighteen children.
His father,  <START:person> Albrecht Dürer the Elder <END> , was a successful goldsmith, originally  <START:person> Ajtósi <END> , who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from Ajtós, near Gyula in Hungary.
The German name "Dürer" is a translation from the Hungarian, "Ajtósi".
Initially, it was "Türer," meaning doormaker, which is "ajtós" in Hungarian (from "ajtó", meaning door).
A door is featured in the coat-of-arms the family acquired.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer <END>  the Younger later changed "Türer", his father's diction of the family's surname, to "Dürer", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer the Elder <END>  married  <START:person> Barbara Holper <END> , the daughter of his master, when he himself became a master in 1467.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's godfather was  <START:person> Anton Koberger <END> , who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's birth and quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four printing-presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad.
 <START:person> Koberger <END> 's most famous publication was the "Nuremberg Chronicle", published in 1493 in German and Latin editions.
It contained an unprecedented 1,809 woodcut illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the Wolgemut workshop.
Dürer may well have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.
Because  <START:person> Dürer <END>  left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources.
After a few years of school,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father.
Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to  <START:person> Michael Wolgemut <END>  at the age of fifteen in 1486.
A self-portrait, a drawing in silverpoint, is dated 1484 ( <START:person> Albertina <END> , Vienna) "when I was a child," as his later inscription says.
Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books.
Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades.
It had strong links with Italy, especially Venice, a relatively short distance across the Alps.
"Wanderjahre" and marriage (1490–94).
After completing his term of apprenticeship,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  followed the common German custom of taking "Wanderjahre"—in effect gap years —in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Dürer was to spend about four years away.
He left in 1490, possibly to work under  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END> , the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Dürer's arrival at Colmar in 1492.
It is unclear where  <START:person> Dürer <END>  travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to Frankfurt and the Netherlands.
In Colmar,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was welcomed by  <START:person> Schongauer <END> 's brothers, the goldsmiths  <START:person> Caspar <END>  and  <START:person> Paul <END>  and the painter  <START:person> Ludwig <END> .
In 1493 Dürer went to Strasbourg, where he would have experienced the sculpture of  <START:person> Nikolaus Gerhaert <END> .
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's first painted self-portrait (now in the Louvre) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancée in Nuremberg.
In early 1492  <START:person> Dürer <END>  travelled to Basel to stay with another brother of  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END> , the goldsmith  <START:person> Georg <END> .
Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was married to  <START:person> Agnes Frey <END>  following an arrangement made during his absence.
 <START:person> Agnes <END>  was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city.
However, no children resulted from the marriage.
First journey to Italy (1494–95).
Within three months of his marriage,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of plague in Nuremberg.
He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps.
Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving "Nemesis".
In Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world.
Through Wolgemut's tutelage,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had learned how to make prints in drypoint and design woodcuts in the German style, based on the works of  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END>  and the Housebook Master.
He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him.
He wrote that  <START:person> Giovanni Bellini <END>  was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice.
His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably  <START:person> Antonio Pollaiuolo <END>  with his interest in the proportions of the body,  <START:person> Mantegna <END> ,  <START:person> Lorenzo di Credi <END>  and others.
Dürer probably also visited Padua and Mantua on this trip.
Return to Nuremberg (1495–1505).
On his return to Nuremberg in 1495,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this).
Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513.
His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as "The Men's Bath House" (ca.
1496).
These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.
It is now thought unlikely that  <START:person> Dürer <END>  cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman.
However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.
Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block.
Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.
His famous series of sixteen great designs for the "Apocalypse" is dated 1498, as is his engraving of" St. Michael Fighting the Dragon".
He made the first seven scenes of the "Great Passion" in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints.
The "Seven Sorrows Polyptych", commissioned by  <START:person> Frederick III <END>  of Saxony in 1496, was executed by  <START:person> Dürer <END>  and his assistants c. 1500.
Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the "Life of the Virgin", which he did not finish for some years.
Neither these, nor the "Great Passion," were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.
During the same period  <START:person> Dürer <END>  trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings.
It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith.
In 1496 he executed the "Prodigal Son", which the Italian Renaissance art historian  <START:person> Giorgio Vasari <END>  singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality.
He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably "Nemesis" (1502), "The Sea Monster" (1498), and "Saint  <START:person> Eustace <END> " (c.
1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals.
His landscapes of this period, such as "Pond in the Woods" and "Willow Mill", are quite different from his earlier watercolours.
There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography.
He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures.
Prints are highly portable and these works made Dürer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.
The Venetian artist  <START:person> Jacopo <END>  de' Barbari, whom  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and  <START:person> Dürer <END>  said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and proportion from him.
De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so  <START:person> Dürer <END>  began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation.
A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of "Adam and Eve" (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces.
This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.
Dürer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the "Betende Hände" (English: "Praying Hands", c. 1508  <START:person> Albertina <END> , Vienna), a study for an apostle in the  <START:person> Heller <END>  altarpiece.
He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his "Young Hare" (1502) and the "Great Piece of Turf" (1503, both also  <START:person> Albertina <END> ).
Second journey to Italy (1505–1507).
In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in tempera on linen.
These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the Paumgartner altarpiece and the "Adoration of the Magi".
In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507.
By this time  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied.
In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo.
This was the altar-piece known as the "Adoration of the Virgin" or the "Feast of Rose Garlands".
It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence.
It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor  <START:person> Rudolf II <END>  and taken to Prague.
Other paintings  <START:person> Dürer <END>  produced in Venice include "The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch", "Christ Disputing with the Doctors" (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.
Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507–1520).
Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520.
His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including  <START:person> Raphael <END> ,  <START:person> Giovanni Bellini <END>  and — mainly through  <START:person> Lorenzo di Credi <END>  —  <START:person> Leonardo da Vinci <END> .
Between 1507 and 1511  <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: "Adam and Eve" (1507), "The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand" (1508, for  <START:person> Frederick <END>  of Saxony), "Virgin with the Iris" (1508), the altarpiece "Assumption of the Virgin" (1509, for  <START:person> Jacob Heller <END>  of Frankfurt), and "Adoration of the Trinity" (1511, for  <START:person> Matthaeus Landauer <END> ).
During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the  <START:person> Life of the Virgin <END> , both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series.
The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of chiaroscuro modelling effects, creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.
Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512.
Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516.
However, in 1513 and 1514  <START:person> Dürer <END>  created his three most famous engravings: "Knight, Death, and the Devil" (1513, probably based on  <START:person> Erasmus <END> 's treatise "Enchiridion militis Christiani"), "St.
 <START:person> Jerome <END>  in his Study", and the much-debated "Melencolia I" (both 1514).
In 1515, he created his "woodcut of a Rhinoceros" which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself.
An image of the Indian rhinoceros, the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.
In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515 and portraits in tempera on linen in 1516.
Patronage of  <START:person> Maximilian I. From <END>  1512,  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  I became  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's major patron.
His commissions included "The Triumphal Arch", a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by  <START:person> Pirckheimer <END> 's translation of  <START:person> Horapollo <END> 's "Hieroglyphica".
The design program and explanations were devised by  <START:person> Johannes Stabius <END> , the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter  <START:person> Jörg Kölderer <END>  and the woodcutting itself by  <START:person> Hieronymous Andreae <END> , with  <START:person> Dürer <END>  as designer-in-chief.
The Arch was followed by "The Triumphal Procession", the program of which was worked out in 1512 by and includes woodcuts by  <START:person> Albrecht Altdorfer <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Springinklee <END> , as well as Dürer.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in lithography.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including  <START:person> Lucas Cranach the Elder <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Baldung <END> .
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before  <START:person> Maximilian <END> 's death in 1519.
Journey to the Netherlands (1520–21).
 <START:person> Maximilian <END> 's sudden death came at a time when  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was concerned he was losing "my sight and freedom of hand" (perhaps caused by arthritis) and increasingly affected by the writings of  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> .
In July 1520  <START:person> Dürer <END>  made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor,  <START:person> Charles V <END> , who was to be crowned at Aachen.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal.
In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of  <START:person> Stefan Lochner <END> ), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw  <START:person> Michelangelo <END> 's  <START:person> Madonna <END>  of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired  <START:person> van Eyck <END> 's altarpiece), and Zeeland.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much.
This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time.
Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.
While providing valuable documentary evidence, Dürer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one.
For example,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  offered his last portrait of  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  to his daughter,  <START:person> Margaret <END>  of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after  <START:person> Margaret <END>  disliked the portrait and declined to accept it.
During this trip he also met  <START:person> Bernard van Orley <END> ,  <START:person> Jan Provoost <END> ,  <START:person> Gerard Horenbout <END> ,  <START:person> Jean Mone <END> ,  <START:person> Joachim Patinir <END>  and  <START:person> Tommaso Vincidor <END> , though he did not, it seems, meet  <START:person> Quentin Matsys <END> .
At the request of Christian II of Denmark,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait.
There he saw "the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land"—the Aztec treasure that  <START:person> Hernán Cortés <END>  had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor  <START:person> Charles V <END>  following the fall of Mexico.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote that this treasure "was much more beautiful to me than miracles.
These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins".
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies.
Having secured his pension,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps malaria —which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.
Final years in Nuremberg (1521–28).
On his return to Nuremberg,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a  <START:person> Sacra Conversazione <END> , though neither was completed.
This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and fortification.
However, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  produced comparatively little as an artist.
In painting, there was only a portrait of , a , , and two panels showing St.  <START:person> John <END>  with St. Peter in and St. Paul with St. Mark in the .
This last great work, the Four Apostles, was given by  <START:person> Dürer <END>  to the City of Nuremberg—although he was given 100 guilders in return.
As for engravings,  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise.
The portraits include  <START:person> Cardinal-Elector Albert <END>  of Mainz;  <START:person> Frederick <END>  the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar  <START:person> Willibald Pirckheimer <END> ;  <START:person> Philipp Melanchthon <END> , and  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  of Rotterdam.
For those of the Cardinal,  <START:person> Melanchthon <END> , and  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician  <START:person> Ulrich Starck <END> ,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.
Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend  <START:person> Willibald Pirckheimer <END> , whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images.
He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  and other scholars.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime.
"The Four Books on Measurement" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and  <START:person> Kepler <END> .
The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527.
"The Four Books on Human Proportion" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins—a considerable sum.
His large house (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer  <START:person> Bernhard Walther <END> ), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark.
It is now a museum.
He is buried in the "Johannisfriedhof" cemetery.
Dürer and the Reformation.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> 's ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote of his desire to draw  <START:person> Luther <END>  in his diary in 1520: "And God help me that I may go to Dr.  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> ; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties."
In a letter to  <START:person> Nicholas Kratzer <END>  in 1524,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote "because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics."
Most tellingly,  <START:person> Pirckheimer <END>  wrote in a letter to  <START:person> Johann Tscherte <END>  in 1530: "I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our  <START:person> Albert <END>  of blessed memory...but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse."
Dürer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525.
Notably,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had contacts with various reformers, such as  <START:person> Zwingli <END> ,  <START:person> Andreas Karlstadt <END> , Melanchthon,  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  and  <START:person> Cornelius Grapheus <END>  from whom  <START:person> Dürer <END>  received  <START:person> Luther <END> 's 'Babylonian Captivity' in 1520.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's later works have also been claimed to show Protestant sympathies.
For example, his woodcut of "The Last Supper" of 1523 has often been understood to have an evangelical theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the Gospel, as well the inclusion of the Eucharistic cup, an expression of Protestant utraquism, although this interpretation has been questioned.
The delaying of the engraving of St Philip, completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was not an iconoclast, in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.
Legacy and influence.
Dürer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities.
His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as  <START:person> Raphael <END> ,  <START:person> Titian <END> , and  <START:person> Parmigianino <END> , all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.
His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the "Little Masters" who attempted few large engravings but continued  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's themes in small, rather cramped compositions.
 <START:person> Lucas van Leyden <END>  was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century.
The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Dürer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ( <START:person> Giulio Campagnola <END>  and  <START:person> Christofano Robetta <END> ), or whole prints ( <START:person> Marcantonio Raimondi <END>  and  <START:person> Agostino Veneziano <END> ).
However,  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's influence became less dominant after 1515, when  <START:person> Marcantonio <END>  perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.
In painting,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles.
His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the "Dürer Renaissance" of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by  <START:person> D'Arcy Thompson <END>  in his book "On Growth and Form".
The Lutheran Church remembers  <START:person> Dürer <END>  as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with  <START:person> Lucas Cranach the Elder <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Burgkmair <END> .
The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and  <START:person> Matthias Grünewald <END>  on August 5.
Theoretical works.
In all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the German language rather than in Latin, Dürer used graphic expressions based on a vernacular, craftsmen's language.
For example, 'Schneckenlinie' ('snail-line') was his term for a spiral form.
Thus,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  contributed to the expansion in German prose which  <START:person> Martin Luther <END>  had begun with his translation of the Bible.
"Four Books on Measurement".
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on geometry is called the "Four Books on Measurement" ("Underweysung der  <START:person> Messung <END>  mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt" or "Instructions for Measuring with Compass and Ruler").
The first book focuses on linear geometry.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's geometric constructions include helices, conchoids and epicycloids.
He also draws on Apollonius, and  <START:person> Johannes Werner <END> 's 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522.
The second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular polygons.
Here Dürer favours the methods of  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  over Euclid.
The third book applies these principles of geometry to architecture, engineering and typography.
In architecture Dürer cites  <START:person> Vitruvius <END>  but elaborates his own classical designs and columns.
In typography,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent.
However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system.
The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra.
Here Dürer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention.
In all these,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  shows the objects as nets.
Finally,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective.
It was in Bologna that Dürer was taught (possibly by  <START:person> Luca Pacioli <END>  or  <START:person> Bramante <END> ) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della  <START:person> Francesca <END> .
He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by  <START:person> Alberti <END>  and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of  <START:person> Leonardo da Vinci <END> .
Although  <START:person> Dürer <END>  made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles.
In addition to these geometrical constructions,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  discusses in this last book of "Underweysung der Messung" an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.
"Four Books on Human Proportion".
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on human proportions is called the "Four Books on Human Proportion" ("Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion") of 1528.
The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height.
Dürer based these constructions on both  <START:person> Vitruvius <END>  and empirical observations of, "two to three hundred living persons," in his own words.
The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an Albertian system, which Dürer probably learned from  <START:person> Francesco di Giorgio <END> 's 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525.
In the third book, Dürer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of convex and concave mirrors; here  <START:person> Dürer <END>  also deals with human physiognomy.
The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.
Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Dürer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  rejected  <START:person> Alberti <END> 's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety.
Nonetheless,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code.
In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naïve approval (' <START:person> Wohlgefallen <END> ') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass').
However, unlike  <START:person> Alberti <END>  and  <START:person> Leonardo <END> ,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images.
Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Dürer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.
In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that "one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year."
List of works.
For lists of  <START:person> Albrecht Dürer <END> 's works, see:   <START:person> Ann Widdecombe  Ann Noreen Widdecombe <END> , DSG (born 4 October 1947) is a former British Conservative Party politician and has been a novelist since 2000.
She is a Privy Councillor and was the Member of Parliament for Maidstone from 1987 to 1997 and for Maidstone and The Weald from 1997 to 2010.
She was a social conservative and a member of the Conservative Christian Fellowship.

Since 2002 she has also made numerous television and radio appearances, including as a television presenter.
She is a convert from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism.
As an MP,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was known for opposing the legality of abortion, her opposition to various issues of LGBT equality, her support for the re-introduction of the death penalty and the retention of blasphemy laws.
Early life.
Born in Bath, Somerset,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is the daughter of  <START:person> Rita Noreen <END>  (née  <START:person> Plummer <END> ; 1911-2007) and Ministry of Defence civil servant  <START:person> James Murray Widdecombe <END> .
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END> 's maternal grandfather,  <START:person> James Henry Plummer <END> , was born to an Irish Catholic family of English descent in Crosshaven, County Cork in 1874.
She attended the Royal Naval School in Singapore, and La Sainte Union Convent School in Bath.
She then read Latin at the University of Birmingham and later attended Lady  <START:person> Margaret Hall <END> , Oxford, to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE).
She worked for Unilever (1973–75) and then as an administrator at the University of London (1975–87) before entering Parliament.
Councillor.
From 1976 to 1978,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was a councillor on Runnymede District Council in Surrey.
She contested the seat of Burnley in Lancashire in the 1979 general election and then, against  <START:person> David Owen <END> , the Plymouth Devonport seat in the 1983 general election.
Member of Parliament.
She was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1987 general election as member for the constituency of Maidstone (which became Maidstone and The Weald in 1997).
Political views.
As an MP,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  expressed conservative views, including opposition to abortion; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become Health Secretary as long as this involved responsibility for abortions.
Although a committed Christian, she has characterised the issue as one of life and death on which her view had been the same when she was agnostic.
Along with  <START:person> John Gummer <END>  MP, she converted from the Church of England to the Catholic Church following the decision of the Church of England on the Ordination of women as priests.
In her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, she called for a zero tolerance policy of prosecution, albeit with only £100 fines as the punishment, for users of cannabis.
This was well received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  consistently opposed LGBT equality.
On the issue of an equal age of consent, she said in 2000: "I do not believe that issues of equality should override the imperatives of protecting the young."
In 2003,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  proposed an amendment opposing repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act, which banned the promotion of homosexuality by local governments.
Out of the 17 parliamentary votes considered by the Public Whip website to concern equal rights for homosexuals,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  took the opposing position in 15 cases, not being present at the other two votes.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has also expressed her opposition to same-sex marriage, introduced by  <START:person> David Cameron <END> 's government in 2014, claiming that "the state must have a preferred model" and "a union that is generally open to procreation".
She is a committed animal lover and one of the few Conservative MPs to have consistently voted for the ban on fox hunting.
She has expressed a variety of views on climate change but has been opposed to legislation reducing emissions.
Her views on the subject appear to have hardened over time.
In 2007, she wrote that she did not want to belittle the issue but was sceptical of the claims that specific actions would prevent catastrophe, then in 2008 that her doubts had been "crystalised" by  <START:person> Nigel Lawson <END> 's book "An Appeal to Reason", before stating in 2009 that "There is no climate change, hasn’t anybody looked out of their window recently?"
She was one of the five MPs who voted against the Climate Change Act 2008.
In 2011 she expressed the view that "climate change money should go to armed services".
Over the years,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has expressed her support for a reintroduction of the death penalty, which was abolished in the UK in 1965.
She notably spoke of her support for its reintroduction for the worst cases of murder in the aftermath of the murder of two 10-year-old girls from  <START:person> Soham <END> , Cambridgeshire, in August 2002, in the  <START:person> Soham <END>  murders.
She supported the argument that the death penalty would have deterrent value, as within five years of its abolition the national murder rate had more than doubled.
In government.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  joined  <START:person> John Major <END> 's government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security in 1990.
In 1993, she was moved to the Department of Employment, and she was promoted to Minister of State the following year.
In 1995, she joined the Home Office as Minister of State for Prisons and visited every prison in Britain.
Shadow Cabinet.
After the fall of the Conservative government to Labour in 1997, she served as Shadow Health Secretary between 1998 and 1999 and later as Shadow Home Secretary between 1999 and 2001 under  <START:person> William Hague <END> .
Leadership contest and backbenches.
During the 2001 Conservative leadership election, she could not find sufficient support amongst Conservative MPs for her leadership candidacy.
She first supported  <START:person> Michael Ancram <END> , who was eliminated in the first round, and then  <START:person> Kenneth Clarke <END> , who lost in the final round.
She afterwards declined to serve in  <START:person> Iain Duncan Smith <END> 's Shadow Cabinet (although she indicated on the television programme "When Louis Met...", prior to the leadership contest, that she wished to retire to the backbenches anyway).
In the 2005 leadership election, she initially supported  <START:person> Kenneth Clarke <END>  again.
Once he was eliminated, she turned support towards  <START:person> Liam Fox <END> .
Following  <START:person> Fox <END> 's subsequent elimination, she took time to reflect before finally declaring for  <START:person> David Davis <END> .
She expressed reservations over the eventual winner  <START:person> David Cameron <END> , feeling that he did not, like the other candidates, have a proven track record, and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his A-List policy, which she has said is "an insult to women".
At the October 2006 Conservative Conference, she was Chief Dragon in a political version of the television programme "Dragons' Den", in which A-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal, which was then torn apart by her team of  <START:person> Rachel Elnaugh <END> ,  <START:person> Oliver Letwin <END>  and  <START:person> Michael Brown <END> .
In an interview with "Metro" in September 2006 she stated that if Parliament were of a normal length, it was likely she would retire at the next general election.
She confirmed her intention to stand down to "The Observer"'s Pendennis diary in September 2007, and again in October 2007 after Prime Minister  <START:person> Gordon Brown <END>  quashed speculation of an autumn 2007 general election.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.
When the expenses claims were leaked, however,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was described by "The Daily Telegraph" as one of the "saints" amongst all MPs.
In May 2009, following the resignation of  <START:person> Michael Martin <END>  as Speaker of the House of Commons, it was reported that  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election.
On 11 June 2009, she confirmed her bid to be the Speaker.
She made it through to the second ballot but came last and was eliminated.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  retired from politics at the 2010 general election.
It was rumoured that she would be a Conservative candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner in 2012, but she refused.
She has since spoken about her opposition to the Coalition Government and her surprise at not being given a peerage by  <START:person> David Cameron <END> .
Recognition.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was appointed an Honorary Fellow of Canterbury Christ Church University at a ceremony held at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 January 2009.
Personal life and family.
Until her retirement at the 2010 general election,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  divided her time between her two homes – one in London and one in the village of Sutton Valence, Kent, in her constituency.
She sold both of these properties, however, upon deciding to retire at the next general election.
She shared her home in London with her widowed mother,  <START:person> Rita Widdecombe <END> , until  <START:person> Rita <END> 's death, on 25 April 2007, aged 95.
In March 2008, she purchased a house in Haytor, on Dartmoor in Devon, to where she has now retired.
Her brother,  <START:person> Malcolm <END>  (1937–2010), who was an Anglican Canon in Bristol, retired in May 2009 and died of metastatic oesophageal cancer on 12 October 2010.
Her nephew,  <START:person> Rev Roger Widdecombe <END> , is an Anglican priest.
She has never married nor had any children.
In November 2007 on BBC Radio 4 she described how a journalist once produced a profile on her with the assumption that she had had at least "one sexual relationship", to which  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  replied: "Be careful, that's the way you get sued".
When interviewer  <START:person> Jenni Murray <END>  asked if she had ever had a sexual relationship,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  laughed "it's nobody else's business".
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has a fondness for cats and has a section of her website devoted to all the pet cats with which she has shared her life.
In a recent interview,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  talked about her appreciation of music despite describing herself as "pretty well tone-deaf".
Religious views.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is a practising Catholic.
She converted in 1993 after leaving the Church of England.
Her reasons for leaving the latter were many, as she explained to reporters from the "New Statesman": In 2010,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  turned down an offer to be Britain's next ambassador to the Holy See, being prevented from accepting by suffering a detached retina.
She was made a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope  <START:person> Benedict XVI <END>  for services to politics and public life on 31 January 2013.
Controversies.
In 1990, following the assassination of the Conservative politician  <START:person> Ian Gow <END>  by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Eastbourne by-election for his seat in the House of Commons was won by the Liberal Democrat  <START:person> David Bellotti <END> .
Upon the announcement,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  told the voters that the IRA would be "toasting their success".
In 1996,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END> , as prisons minister, defended the Government's policy to shackle pregnant prisoners with handcuffs and chains when in hospital receiving ante-natal care.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  told the Commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping.
"Some MPs may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape.
Unfortunately this is not true.
The fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners, and since 1990, 20 women have escaped from hospitals".
 <START:person> Jack Straw <END> , Labour's Home Affairs spokesman at the time, said it was "degrading and unnecessary" for a woman to be shackled at any stage .
In 1997, during the Conservative leadership election of  <START:person> William Hague <END> ,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  spoke out against  <START:person> Michael Howard <END> , under whom she had served when he was Home Secretary.
She remarked that "there is something of the night about him".
The remark was considered to be extremely damaging to  <START:person> Howard <END> , who was frequently satirised as a vampire thereafter.
He came last in the poll.
 <START:person> Howard <END>  went on to become party leader in 2003, however, and  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  then stated, "I explained fully what my objections were in 1997 and I do not retract anything I said then.
But this is 2005 and we have to look to the future and not the past."
In 2001, when  <START:person> Michael Portillo <END>  was running for leader of the Conservative Party,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  described him and his allies as "backbiters".
She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.

Following her second appearance,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  vowed she would never appear on the show again because of comments made by panellist  <START:person> Jimmy Carr <END> .
She wrote, "His idea of wit is a barrage of filth and the sort of humour most men grow out of in their teens... [T]here's no amount of money for which I would go through those two recording hours again.
At one stage I nearly walked out."
She did, however, stand by her appraisal of regular panellists  <START:person> Ian Hislop <END>  and  <START:person> Paul Merton <END> , whom she has called "the fastest wits in showbusiness".
In 2007, she awarded the "University Challenge" trophy to the winners.

In October 2010, she appeared on BBC One's "Strictly Come Dancing", partnered by  <START:person> Anton du Beke <END> , winning the support of some viewers despite low marks from the judges.
After nine weeks of routines strongly flavoured by comedy the couple had received enough support in the public vote to stay in the contest.

 <START:person> Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie  Antoine Thomson <END>  d'Abbadie d'Arrast (3 January 1810 – 19 March 1897) was a French explorer, geographer, ethnologist, linguist and astronomer notable for his travels in Ethiopia during the first half of the 19th century.
He was the older brother of  <START:person> Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie <END> , with whom he traveled.
Biography.
He was born in the Irish city of Dublin from a partially Basque noble family of the French province of  <START:person> Soule <END> .
His father,  <START:person> Michel Abbadie <END> , was born in Arrast-Larrebieu and his mother was Irish.
His grandfather  <START:person> Jean-Pierre <END>  was an abbot and a notary in Soule.
The family moved to France in 1818 where the brothers received a careful scientific education.
In 1827,  <START:person> Antoine <END>  received a bachelier (bachelor) degree in Toulouse.
Starting in 1829, he began his education in Paris, where he studied law.
He married  <START:person> Virginie Vincent de Saint-Bonnet <END>  on 21 February 1859, and settled in Hendaye where he purchased 250ha to build a castle, and became the mayor of the city from 1871 to 1875.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END>  was a knight of the Legion of Honour, which he received on 27 September 1850, and a member of the French Academy of Sciences.
He died in 1897, and bequeathed the  <START:person> Abbadi <END>  domain and castle in Hendaye, yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences.
Science and explorations.
In 1835 the French Academy sent  <START:person> Antoine <END>  on a scientific mission to Brazil, the results being published at a later date (1873) under the title of "Observations relatives à la physique du globe faites au Brésil et en Éthiopie".
In 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at Massawa in February 1838.
They journeyed throughout Ethiopia, travelling as far south as the Kingdom of Kaffa, sometimes together and sometimes separately.
In addition to his studies in the sciences, he delved into the political fray exerting influence in favor of France and the Roman Catholic missionaries.
While in Ethiopia they returned to France in 1848 with notes on the geography, geology, archaeology, and natural history of the region.
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues.
He was especially attacked by  <START:person> Charles Tilstone Beke <END> , who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to Kana.
But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention—hotly contested by  <START:person> Beke <END> —that the Blue Nile was the main stream.
The topographical results of his explorations were published in Paris between 1860 and 1873 in "Géodésie d'Éthiopie", full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps.
Of the "Géographie de l'Éthiopie" (Paris, 1890) only one volume was published.
In "Un Catalogue raisonné de manuscrits éthiopiens" (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian manuscripts collected by  <START:person> Antoine <END> .
He also compiled various vocabularies, including a "Dictionnaire de la langue amariñña" (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the "Shepherd of Hermas", with the Latin version, in 1860.
He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions.
Under the title of "Reconnaissances magnétiques" he published in 1890 an account of the magnetic observations made by him in the course of several journeys to the Red Sea and the Levant.
The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by  <START:person> Arnaud <END>  in 1868 under the title of " <START:person> Douze <END>  ans dans la Haute Ethiopie".
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  was responsible for streamlining techniques towards geodesy, along with inventing a new theodolite for measuring angles.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END> , a Basque and bascophile.
Basque through his father,  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  developed a particular interest about the Basque Language after meeting the Prince  <START:person> Louis Lucien Bonaparte <END>  in London.
He started his academic work on Basque in 1852.
A speaker of both Souletin and  <START:person> Lapurdian <END> , a resident of Lapurdi,  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  considered himself a Basque from  <START:person> Soule <END> .
The popularity of the motto Zazpiak Bat is attributed to  <START:person> Abbadie <END> .
The castle or château.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END>  gave his castle home the name "Abbadia", which is the name still used in Basque.
However in French it is usually referred to as "Chateau d'Abbadie" or "Domaine d'Abbadia", and locally it is not unusual for it to be called "le Chateau d'Antoine d'Abbadie".
The château was built between 1864 and 1879 on a cliff by the Atlantic Ocean, and was designed by  <START:person> Viollet Le Duc <END>  in the Neo Gothic style, and is considered one of the most important examples of French Gothic Revival Architecture.
It is divided in three parts : the observatory and library, the chapel, and the living quarters.
Nowadays the château still belongs to the Academy of Science to which it was bequeathed in 1895 on condition of its producing a catalogue of half-a-million stars within fifty years' time, with the work to be carried out by members of religious orders.
The château was classified as a protected historical monument by France in 1984.
Most of the château property now belongs to the Coastal Protection Agency, and is managed by the city of Hendaye.
Literary works.
Awards and memberships.
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  received the French Legion of Honor on 27 September 1850 with the order of chevalier or knight.
He was a member of the Bureau des Longitudes and also the French Academy of Sciences.
Both brothers received the grand medal of the Paris Geographical Society in 1850.
Adware  Adware, or advertising-supported software, is any software package that automatically renders advertisements in order to generate revenue for its author.
The advertisements may be in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process.
The functions may be designed to analyze which Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there.
The term is sometimes used to refer to software that displays unwanted advertisements.
Advertising-supported software.
In legitimate software, the advertising functions are integrated into or bundled with the program.
Adware is usually seen by the developer as a way to recover development costs, and in some cases, it may allow the software to be provided to the user free of charge or at a reduced price.
The income derived from presenting advertisements to the user may allow or motivate the developer to continue to develop, maintain and upgrade the software product.
The use of advertising-supported software in business is becoming increasingly popular, with a third of IT and business executives in a 2007 survey by McKinsey & Company planning to be using ad-funded software within the following two years.
Advertisement-funded software is also one of the business models for open-source software.
In application software.
Some software is offered in both an advertising-supported mode and a paid, advertisement-free mode.
The latter is usually available by an online purchase of a license or registration code for the software that unlocks the mode, or the purchase and download of a separate version of the software.
Some software authors offer advertising-supported versions of their software as an alternative option to business organizations seeking to avoid paying large sums for software licenses, funding the development of the software with higher fees for advertisers.
Examples of advertising-supported software include the Windows version of the Internet telephony application Skype, and the Amazon Kindle 3 family of e-book readers, which has versions called "Kindle with Special Offers" that display advertisements on the home page and in sleep mode in exchange for substantially lower pricing.
In 2012, Microsoft and its advertising division, Microsoft Advertising, announced that Windows 8, the forthcoming major release of the Microsoft Windows operating system, would provide built-in methods for software authors to use advertising support as a business model.
The idea had been considered since as early as 2005.
In software as a service.
Support by advertising is a popular business model of software as a service (SaaS) on the Web.
Notable examples include the email service Gmail and other Google Apps products, and the social network Facebook.
Microsoft has also adopted the advertising-supported model for many of its social software SaaS offerings.
The Microsoft Office Live service was also available in an advertising-supported mode.
In the view of Federal Trade Commission staff, there appears to be general agreement that software should be considered "spyware" only if it is downloaded or installed on a computer without the user's knowledge and consent.
However, unresolved issues remain concerning how, what, and when consumers need to be told about software installed on their computers for consent to be adequate.
For instance, distributors often disclose in an end-user license agreement that there is additional software bundled with primary software, but some panelists and commenters did not view such disclosure as sufficient to infer consent to the installation of the bundled software.
As malware.
The term "adware" is frequently used to describe a form of malware (malicious software), usually that which presents unwanted advertisements to the user of a computer.
The advertisements produced by adware are sometimes in the form of a pop-up.
When the term is used in this way, the severity of its implication varies.
While some sources rate adware only as an "irritant", others classify it as an "online threat" or even rate it as seriously as computer viruses and trojans.
The precise definition of the term in this context also varies.
Adware that observes the computer user's activities without their consent and reports it to the software's author is called spyware.
Programs have been developed to detect, quarantine, and remove advertisement-displaying malware, including Ad-Aware, AdwCleaner, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, Spyware Doctor and Spybot Search & Destroy.
In addition, almost all commercial antivirus software currently detect adware and spyware, or offer a separate spyware detection package.
 <START:person> Aedui  Aedui <END> ,  <START:person> Haedui <END>  or Hedui (Ancient Greek: Αἰδούοι), were a Gallic people of  <START:person> Gallia Lugdunensis <END> , who inhabited the country between the Arar (Saône) and  <START:person> Liger <END>  (Loire), in today's France.
Their territory thus included the greater part of the modern departments of Saône-et-Loire, Côte-d'Or and Nièvre.
Geography.
The country of the Aedui is defined by reports of them in ancient writings.
The upper Loire formed their western border, separating them from the Bituriges.
The Saône formed their eastern border, separating them from the Sequani.
The  <START:person> Sequani <END>  did not reside in the region of the confluence of the Doubs into the Saône and of the latter into the Rhône, as  <START:person> Caesar <END>  says that the Helvetii, following the pass between the Jura Mountains and the Rhône southwards, which belonged to the Sequani, plundered the territory of the Aedui.
These circumstances explain an apparent contradiction in  <START:person> Strabo <END> , who in one sentence says that the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  lived between the Saône and the Doubs, and in the next, that the  <START:person> Sequani <END>  lived across the Saône (eastward).
Both statements are true, the first in the south, and the second to the north.
History.
According to  <START:person> Livy <END>  (v.
34), they took part in the expedition of Bellovesus into Italy in the 6th century BC.
Before  <START:person> Caesar <END> 's time, they had attached themselves to the Romans, and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the Roman people.
When the Sequani, their hereditary rivals, with the assistance of a Germanic chieftain named Ariovistus, defeated and massacred the Aedui at the Battle of Magetobriga, the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  sent  <START:person> Diviciacus <END> , the druid, to Rome to appeal to the senate for help.
But his mission was unsuccessful.
On his arrival in  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (58 BC),  <START:person> Caesar <END>  restored their independence.
In spite of this, the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  joined the Gallic coalition against  <START:person> Caesar <END>  ("B.
G." vii.
42), but after the surrender of Vercingetorix at Alesia, were glad to return to their allegiance.
 <START:person> Augustus <END>  dismantled their native capital Bibracte on  <START:person> Mont Beuvray <END> , and substituted a new town with a half-Roman, half-Gaulish name,  <START:person> Augustodunum <END>  (modern Autun).
In 21, during the reign of  <START:person> Tiberius <END> , they revolted under  <START:person> Julius Sacrovir <END> , and seized Augustodunum, but were soon put down by  <START:person> Gaius Silius <END>  (Tacitus "Ann."
iii.
43-46).
The Aedui were the first of the Gauls to receive from the emperor  <START:person> Claudius <END>  the distinction of "jus honorum"; thus being the first Gauls permitted to become senators.
The oration of Eumenius, in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place Augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected.
The chief magistrate of the Aedui in  <START:person> Caesar <END> 's time was called Vergobretus (according to  <START:person> Mommsen <END> , "judgment-worker"), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death, but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier.
Certain clientes, or small communities, were also dependent upon the Aedui.
It is possible that the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  adopted many of the governmental practices of the Romans, such as electing magistrates and other officials.
Or perhaps this was a natural development in their political system.
It is thought that other Celtic tribes, such as the Remi and the Baiocasses, also elected their leaders.
Bibliography.
<br>   <START:person> Aelia Capitolina  Aelia Capitolina <END>  (; Latin in full: "COLONIA ÆLIA CAPITOLINA") was a Roman colony, built under the emperor  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  on the site of Jerusalem, which was in ruins since the siege of 70 AD, leading in part to the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136.
Foundation.
Jerusalem was still in ruins from the First Jewish–Roman War in 70.
 <START:person> Josephus <END>  – a contemporary historian and hagiographer who was born in Jerusalem and fought the Romans in that war – reports that "Jerusalem ... was so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations, that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once been a place of habitation."
When the Roman Emperor  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  vowed to rebuild Jerusalem from the wreckage in 130, he considered reconstructing Jerusalem as a gift to the Jewish people.
The Jews awaited with hope, but then after  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  visited Jerusalem, he was told that rebuilding the Second Temple would encourage sedition.
He then decided to rebuild the city as a Roman colony which would be inhabited by his legionaries.
 <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's new plans included temples to the major regional deities, and certain Roman gods, in particular Jupiter Capitolinus.
The Jewish Bar Kokhba revolt, which took the Romans three years to suppress, enraged  <START:person> Hadrian <END> , and he came to be determined to erase Judaism from the province.
Circumcision was forbidden, Iudaea province was renamed Syria Palaestina and Jews (formally all circumcised men) were banned from entering the city on pain of death.
Christianity.
According to Eusebius, the Jerusalem church was scattered twice, in 70 and 135, with the difference that from 70-130 the bishops of Jerusalem have evidently Jewish names, whereas after 135 the bishops of  <START:person> Aelia Capitolina <END>  appear to be Greeks.
Eusebius' evidence for continuation of a church at Aelia Capitolina is confirmed by the Bordeaux Pilgrim.
Name.
"Aelia" came from  <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's "nomen gentile", "Aelius", while "Capitolina" meant that the new city was dedicated to "Jupiter Capitolinus", to whom a temple was built on the site of the former Jewish temple, the Temple Mount.
The Latin name "Aelia" is the source of the Arabic term  <START:person> Iliyā <END> ' (إلياء), an early Islamic name for Jerusalem.
Plan of the city.
The city was without walls, protected by a light garrison of the Tenth Legion, during the Late Roman Period.
The detachment at Jerusalem, which apparently encamped all over the city’s western hill, was responsible for preventing Jews from returning to the city.
Roman enforcement of this prohibition continued through the 4th century.
The urban plan of  <START:person> Aelia Capitolina <END>  was that of a typical Roman town wherein main thoroughfares crisscrossed the urban grid lengthwise and widthwise.
The urban grid was based on the usual central north-south road ("cardo") and central east-west route ("decumanus").
However, as the main cardo ran up the western hill, and the Temple Mount blocked the eastward route of the main decumanus, a second pair of main roads was added; the secondary cardo ran down the Tyropoeon Valley, and the secondary decumanus ran just to the north of the Temple Mount.
The main Hadrianic cardo terminated not far beyond its junction with the decumanus, where it reached the Roman garrison's encampment, but in the Byzantine era it was extended over the former camp to reach the southern walls of the city.
The two cardines converged near the "Damascus Gate", and a semicircular piazza covered the remaining space; in the piazza a columnar monument was constructed, hence the Arabic name for the gate "Bab el-Amud" ("Gate of the Column").
Tetrapylones were constructed at the other junctions between the main roads.
This street pattern has been preserved in the Old City of Jerusalem to the present.
The original thoroughfare, flanked by rows of columns and shops, was about 73 feet (22 meters) wide, but buildings have extended onto the streets over the centuries, and the modern lanes replacing the ancient grid are now quite narrow.
The substantial remains of the western cardo have now been exposed to view near the junction with Suq el-Bazaar, and remnants of one of the tetrapylones are preserved in the 19th century Franciscan chapel at the junction of the Via Dolorosa and Suq Khan ez-Zeit.
As was standard for new Roman cities,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  placed the city's main Forum at the junction of the main cardo and decumanus, now the location for the (smaller) Muristan.
Adjacent to the Forum, at the junction of the same cardo, and the other decumanus,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  built a large temple to  <START:person> Venus <END> , which later became the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; despite 11th century destruction, which resulted in the modern Church having a much smaller footprint, several boundary walls of  <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's temple have been found among the archaeological remains beneath the Church.
The "Struthion Pool" lay in the path of the northern decumanus, so  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  placed vaulting over it, added a large pavement on top, and turned it into a secondary Forum; the pavement can still be seen under the Convent of the Sisters of Zion.
Afghan Turkestan  Afghan Turkestan is a region in northern Afghanistan, on the border with the former Soviet republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
In the 19th century there was a province in Afghanistan named Turkestan Province until abolished by  <START:person> Abdur Rahman <END> , and was centred on  <START:person> Mazari Sharif <END>  and included territory in the modern provinces of Balkh, Jowzjan, Faryab and Sar-e Pol.
The whole territory, from the junction of the Kokcha river with the Amu Darya on the north-east to the province of Herat on the south-west, was some 500 mi in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the Hindu Kush of 114 miles (183 km).
It thus comprised about 57,000 sqmi or roughly two-ninths of the former Kingdom of Afghanistan.
Geography.
The area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the Karakum Desert.
Population.
The bulk of the people are Uzbek and Turkmen with large concentrations of Tajik, Hazara and Pashtuns.
History.
Ancient Balkh or Bactria was an integral part of Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex, and was occupied by Indo-Iranians.
In the 5th century BCE, it became a province of the Achaemenian Empire and later became part of the Seleucid Empire.
About 250 BC Diodotus (Theodotus), governor of Bactria under the Seleucidae, declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to Parthian and nomadic movements about 126 BC.
After this came a Buddhist era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak.
The district was devastated by  <START:person> Genghis Khan <END> , and has never since fully recovered its prosperity.
For about a century it belonged to the Delhi empire, and then fell into Uzbek hands.
In the 18th century it formed part of the dominion of  <START:person> Ahmad Khan Durrani <END> , and so remained under his son  <START:person> Timur <END> .
But under the fratricidal wars of  <START:person> Timur <END> 's sons the separate khanates fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbek chiefs.
At the beginning of the 19th century they belonged to Bukhara; but under the emir  <START:person> Dost Mahommed <END>  the Afghans recovered Balkh and Tashkurgan in 1850,  <START:person> Akcha <END>  and the four western khanates in 1855, and Kunduz in 1859.
The sovereignty over Andkhui, Shibarghan,  <START:person> Saripul <END>  and Maimana was in dispute between Bukhara and Kabul until settled by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 in favour of the Afghan claim.
Under the strong rule of  <START:person> Abdur Rahman <END>  these outlying territories were closely welded to Kabul; but after the accession of  <START:person> Habibullah <END>  the bonds once more relaxed.
In 1890 the district of Qataghan and Badakhshan was divided from Afghan Turkestan and made into the Qataghan-Badakhshan Province.
Administration of the province was assigned to the Northern Bureau in Kabul.
Afyonkarahisar  Afyonkarahisar (], Turkish: "afyon" "poppy, opium", 'kara' "black", 'hisar' "fortress") is a city in western Turkey, the capital of Afyon Province.
Afyon is in mountainous countryside inland from the Aegean coast, 250 km south-west of Ankara along the Akarçay River.
Elevation 1021 m.
Population (2010 census) 173,100  Etymology.
The name Afyon  <START:person> Kara Hisar <END>  (literally "opium black castle" in Turkish), since opium was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock.
Also known simply as Afyon.
Older spellings include  <START:person> Karahisar-i Sahip <END> , Afium-Kara-hissar and Afyon Karahisar.
The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the Turkish Parliament in 2004.
History.
The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time.
It was known to the Hittites as  <START:person> Hapanuwa <END> , and was later occupied by Phrygians, Lydians and Achaemenid Persians until it was conquered by  <START:person> Alexander the Great <END> .
After the death of  <START:person> Alexander <END>  the city (now known as Akroinοn (Ακροϊνόν) or Nikopolis (Νικόπολις) in Ancient Greek), was ruled by the Seleucids and the kings of Pergamon, then Rome and Byzantium.
The Byzantine emperor  <START:person> Leo III <END>  after his victory over Arab besiegers in 740 renamed the city Nicopolis (Greek for "city of victory").
The Seljuq Turks then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to  <START:person> Kara Hissar <END>  ("black castle") after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201 meters above the town.
Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the Sâhib Ata and then the Germiyanids.
The castle was much fought over during the Crusades and was finally conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Beyazid I in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of  <START:person> Timur Lenk <END>  in 1402.
It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.
The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city with the typical Ottoman urban mixture of Turks and Armenians.
During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock.
During the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) campaign (part of the Turkish War of Independence) Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by French, Italian and then Greek forces.
However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region.
After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.
The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name "Afyon") until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.
Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime.
They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the poppy straw method of extraction.
Afyon was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 50 lira banknote of 1927-1938.
Climate.
Afyonkarahisar has a continental climate (Köppen climate classification: "Dsa" and "Dsb"), with cold and snowy winters and warm to hot and dry summers.
Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn.
Afyon today.
Afyon is the centre of an agricultural area and the city has a country town feel to it.
There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey.
However Afyon Kocatepe University opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.
Nowadays Afyon is known for its marble (in 2005 there were 355 marble quarries in the province of Afyon producing high quality white stone), its "sucuk" (spiced sausages), its "kaymak" (meaning either "cream" or a white Turkish Delight) and various handmade weavings.
There is also a large cement factory.
This is a natural crossroads, the routes from Ankara to İzmir and from Istanbul to Antalya intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys.
There are a number of well-established roadside restaurants for travellers to breakfast on the local cuisine.
Some of these places are modern well-equipped hotels and spas; the mineral waters of Afyon are renowned for their healing qualities.
There is also a long string of roadside kiosks selling the local Turkish delight.
Transport.
Afyon is also an important rail junction between İzmir, Konya, Ankara and Istanbul.
Afyon is on the route of the planned high-speed rail line between Ankara and Izmir.

Atari Jaguar  The Atari Jaguar is a fifth generation home video game console that was developed by Atari Corporation.
The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the Atari brand, originally released in North America in November 1993.
Marketed by  <START:person> Atari <END>  as the first 64-bit video game console, the Jaguar was designed to compete with the 16-bit Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform.
Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 90s, and was designed by Flare Technology, who were tasked by Atari to create two consoles; the Atari Panther, which would compete with the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo, and a successor, the Jaguar, which would surpass the capabilities of any other console on the market at the time.
With development of the Jaguar running ahead of schedule, the Panther was cancelled, and the release of the Jaguar was pushed forward.
It was originally released to test markets in New York City and San Francisco in November 1993, and to the general public in 1994.
Upon release, it was initially criticized for its complex controller design and the console's failure to distinguish itself from its 16-bit competitors.
It was also criticized for its low quality game library, with poorly received games such as "Cybermorph" and "Kasumi Ninja" gaining more publicity than other titles on the system.
The console's multi-chip architecture, making game development for the console difficult, and underwhelming sales contributed to the console's lack of third party support.
This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a limited game library, comprising only 67 licensed titles.
Some games for the system, however, such as "Alien vs Predator", "Tempest 2000" and ports of id Software's "Wolfenstein 3D" and "Doom", are well received by contemporary critics.
Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the Jaguar with a CD-ROM add-on known as the Atari Jaguar CD, though, with the release of the Sega Saturn and Sony's PlayStation in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was eventually discontinued in 1996.
The Jaguar was deemed a commercial failure, and prompted Atari to leave the home video game console market.
After Hasbro Interactive bought out Atari in the late 1990s, the rights to the Jaguar were released into the public domain, with the console being declared an open platform.
Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces homebrew games for the console.
Notable homebrew titles for the Jaguar include "Skyhammer" and "BattleSphere".
Development.
The Jaguar was developed by the members of Flare Technology, a company formed by  <START:person> Martin Brennan <END>  and  <START:person> John Mathieson <END> .
The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the Sega Genesis or the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but they could also be cost-effective.
Impressed by their work on the Konix Multisystem, Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called Flare II, with Atari providing the funding.
Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari Corp.
One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed "Panther"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed "Jaguar"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari Corp. canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.
Reception.
The Jaguar was introduced in 1993 at a price of $249.99,
under a $500 million manufacturing deal with IBM.
The system was initially marketed only in the New York City and the San Francisco Bay areas, under the slogan "Do the Math", claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems.
A US-wide release followed in early 1994.
The Atari Jaguar struggled to attain a substantial user base.
In 1993, Atari reported that they had shipped 17,000 units as part of the system's initial test market.
By the end of 1994, Atari reported that they had sold approximately 100,000 systems and had reduced the price to improve the competitive nature of the console.
By the end of 1995, Sony and Sega had entered the marketplace with competing consoles and Atari's sales declined rapidly.
In Atari's 1995 annual report, they noted: "Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit.
Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively."
Jaguar did earn praise with titles such as "Tempest 2000", "Doom", and "Wolfenstein 3D".
The most successful title during the Jaguar's first year was "Alien vs. Predator".
Both it and "Tempest 2000" were named among the system's defining titles by "GamePro" in 2007.
With such a small library of games to challenge the incumbent 16-bit game consoles, Jaguar's appeal never grew beyond a small gaming audience.
In 2006 IGN editor  <START:person> Craig Harris <END>  rated the Jaguar controller as the worst ever, criticizing the complexity of the "phone keypad".
A version that has six action buttons, the Pro Controller, is suggested for certain games.
Lack of titles was attributable to two main factors: the Jaguar's questionable long-term prospects among third-party game-publishers and the problematic nature of developing games for the Jaguar.
Atari had one opportunity to convince third-party developers, vital for the diversity of Jaguar's game library, with a solid retail-performance, but as things played out, post-holiday sales figures questioned the viability of Atari's business; Atari failed to attract many third-party developers already committed to other game platforms.
In addition, the Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's memory controller, which prevented code execution out of system RAM.
Less severe, but still annoying defects included a buggy UART.
The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code.
Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete.
Writing game-code was often an endurance exercise in the tedious assembler.
In a July 1995 interview with "Next Generation", then-CEO  <START:person> Sam Tramiel <END>  declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the Sega Saturn, and slightly weaker than the PlayStation.
By the end of 1995, Atari's revenues declined by more than half, from US$38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995.<ref name="10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996"></ref> In late 1995, Atari Corp. ran early-morning infomercial advertisements with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system.
The infomercials ran most of the year, but did not significantly sell the remaining stock of Jaguar systems.
In its 10-K405 SEC Filing, filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders of the truly dire nature of the Jaguar business: From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar.
As of December 31, 1995, Atari had approximately 100,000 units of Jaguar in inventory.
Atari had already suffered an ill-fated crash in the mid-1980s as a result of the oversaturation of the video game market by third-party developers.
Production of the Jaguar ceased after Atari Corp. merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover.
In a last-ditch effort to revive the Jaguar, Atari Corp. tried to play down the other two consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only "64-bit" system.
This claim is questioned by some, because the CPU (68000) and GPU executed a 32-bit instruction-set, but sent control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors (or "graphics accelerators").
Atari Corp.'s reasoning that the 32-bit "Tom" and " <START:person> Jerry <END> " chips work in tandem to add up to a 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by "Electronic Gaming Monthly", which commented that "If Sega did the math for the Sega Saturn the way Atari did the math for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine."
Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs.
In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic.
Over the short life of the console, several add-on peripherals were announced.
Even prior to the console's test market launch, Atari had promised a CD-based add-on console, a dial-up internet link with support for online gaming, a virtual reality headset, and an MPEG-2 video card.
However, only the ProController, the Atari Jaguar CD drive, and the JagLink (a simple two-console networking device) reached retail shelves.
A voice modem and virtual reality headset (with infrared head-tracking) existed in prototype form, but were never commercialized (see  <START:person> Loki <END>  and Konix Multisystem for early development).
Reviewing the Jaguar just a few weeks prior to its launch, "GamePro" gave it a "thumbs sideways".
They praised the power of the hardware but criticized the controller, and were dubious of how the software lineup would turn out, commenting that Atari's failure to secure support from key third party publishers such as Capcom was a bad sign.
They concluded that "Like the 3DO, the Jaguar is a risky investment just not quite as expensive."
Legacy.
After the Atari Corporation properties were bought out by Hasbro Interactive in the late 1990s, Hasbro released the rights to the Jaguar, declaring the console an open platform and opening the doors for homebrew development.
A few developers, including Telegames and Songbird Productions, have not only released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past, but also several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following.
In the United Kingdom in 2001, a deal was struck between Telegames and retailer Game to bring the Jaguar to Game's retail outlets.
The machine was initially sold for £29.99 brand new and the software was ranged between £9.99 for more common games such as "Doom" and "Ruiner Pinball", and up to £39.99 for more sought-after releases such as "Defender 2000" and "Checkered Flag".
The machine had a presence in the stores until 2007 when remaining consoles were sold off for £9.99 and games were sold for as low as 97p.
This deal was seen as a move to remain competitive with Game's rival at the time, Gamestation, who were well known for stocking retro formats.
Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, has since purchased the molding plates for the Jaguar's casing as with minor modification they were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera.
The game cartridge molds were reused to create an optional memory expansion card.
In 2015, the molds for the console and cartridges were purchased from Imagin Systems by  <START:person> Mike Kennedy <END> , owner of the "Game Gavel" video game auction website and "Retro Magazine", a Kickstarter funded print and digital retro video game magazine, to manufacture shells for a brand new,  <START:person> Kickstarter <END>  funded, cartridge-based video game console, called the "Retro VGS" (Retro Video Game System).
The purchase of the molds from Imagin Systems was far cheaper than designing and manufacturing entirely new molds, and  <START:person> Kennedy <END>  described their acquisition as "the entire reason [the Retro VGS] is possible".
The Jaguar continues to have a small and dedicated game development circle.
Technical specifications.
From the Jaguar Software Reference manual, page 1: Jaguar is a custom chip set primarily intended to be the heart of a very high-performance games/leisure computer.
It may also be used as a graphics accelerator in more complex systems, and applied to workstation and business uses.
As well as a general purpose CPU, Jaguar contains four processing units.
These are the Object Processor, Graphics Processor,  <START:person> Blitter <END> , and Digital Sound Processor.
Jaguar provides these blocks with a 64-bit data path to external memory devices, and is capable of a very high data transfer rate into external dynamic RAM.
Accessories.
Atari Jaguar CD.
The Atari Jaguar CD or Jag CD is a CD-ROM peripheral that sat on top the Atari Jaguar video game console and plugged in through the cartridge slot.
Memory Track.
Released in 1995, the Atari Jaguar CD "Memory Track" is a cartridge that contains a 128 K EEPROM, allowing Atari Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and saved games.
The Memory Track Program Manager is accessed by pushing the option button while the system is starting, and exited by pushing the * and # keys simultaneously.
Team Tap.
The Atari Jaguar "Team Tap" is a multi-player adapter for use on certain Jaguar games.
It was available by itself, or as a pack-in with the four player game "White Men Can't Jump".
Each Team Tap supports up to 4 players; by plugging Team Taps into both Jaguar controller ports, up to 8 players are supported.
The only games compatible with the Team Tap are "White Men Can't Jump" and "NBA Jam Tournament Edition".
Jaglink Interface.
The Atari Jaguar "Jaglink Interface" enables players to hook two Atari Jaguars connected to two TVs together with a phone cable, allowing multiplayer gaming on two separate screens.
The only games to support this add-on are "DOOM", "BattleSphere", and "AirCars".
The Jaglink is also used to connect the Jaguar to a PC for game development using the JUGS DD (Jaguar Unmodified Game Server Dev Disc) dev system disk for Jaguar CD that was included in "BattleSphere Gold", which also came with the "JUGS Device" (a DB9 to phone cord adapter) to connect a PC to a Jaguar via Jaglink.
Jaglink is also compatible with ICD's CatBox.
 <START:person> Jaglink <END>  came in sets of two.
Atari Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge.
The Atari Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge from B&C Computervisions allows players to boot unencrypted discs on an Atari Jaguar CD system.
CatBox by ICD.
The "CatBox" is an unofficial expansion peripheral for the Atari Jaguar released by the Rockford, Illinois company ICD.
It was originally slated to be released early in the Jaguar's life, in the second quarter of 1994, but was not actually released until 1996.
The ICD CatBox plugs directly into the AV/DSP connectors located in the rear of the Jaguar console and provides three main functions.
These are audio, video, and communications.
It features six output formats, three for audio (line level stereo, RGB monitor, headphone jack with volume control) and three for video (composite, S-Video, and RGB analog component video) making the Jaguar compatible with multiple high quality monitor systems and multiple monitors at the same time.
It is capable of communications methods known as CatNet and RS-232 as well as DSP pass through, allowing the user to connect two or more Jaguars together for multi player games either directly or with modems.
The ICD CatBox features a polished steel casing and red LEDs in the jaguar's eyes on the logo that indicate communications activity.
An IBM AT type null modem cable may be used to connect two Jaguars together.
The CatBox is also compatible with Atari's Jaglink Interface peripheral.
Atari Jaguar VR Headset Prototype.
Atari developed several Virtual Reality headset prototypes for the Jaguar.
There were two models, a blue and grey high resolution unit, and a red and grey low resolution unit.
After Atari merged with JTS in 1996, most of the headsets were reportedly destroyed, but not all of them.
Supposedly, there are only two working units known to be left in existence.
The only game released that was compatible with the Atari Jaguar VR Headset was Missile Command 3D.
Atari Jaguar Cortina Web TV Adapter Prototype.
An adaptor for the Jaguar that allows for WebTV access was revealed in 1998, one prototype is known to exist.

In 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it partnered up with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator.
The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled all together, but not before an estimated 100 or so were made.
The JVM as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers.
Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play.
The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is  <START:person> Ultra Vortek <END> , the modem is initialized in the Ultra Vortek start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.
COJAG Arcade Games.
Atari Games licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games.
The system, named COJAG (for "Coin-Op Jaguar"), replaced the 68000 with a 68020 or MIPS R3000-based CPU (depending on the board version), and added a hard drive and more RAM.
It ran the lightgun games "Area 51" and "Maximum Force", which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine.
Other games ("3 On 3 Basketball"; "Fishin' Frenzy"; "Freeze"; "Vicious Circle") were developed but never released.
Atari Jaguar Duo.
The Atari Jaguar Duo was a proposed console similar to the Sega Neptune.
It was an attempt by Atari to combine the Atari Jaguar and Atari Jaguar CD to make a new console.
It was never completed and was thus never released.
After cancelling the console, Atari was bought by Hasbro and ceased all console development.
Australian Army  The Australian Army is Australia's military land force.
It is part of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) along with the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force.
While the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) commands the ADF, the Army is commanded by the Chief of Army (CA).
The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the Minister for Defence.
Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, only in World War II has Australian territory come under direct attack.
History.
The history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods: During its history the Australian Army has fought in a number of major wars, including: Second Boer War (1899–1902), First World War (1914–18), the Second World War (1939–45), Korea War (1950–53), Malayan Emergency (1950–60), Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation (1962–66), Vietnam War (1962–73), and more recently in Afghanistan (2001 – present) and Iraq (2003–2009).
Since 1947 the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations, however the non United Nations sponsored Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai is a notable exception.
Australia's largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 in East Timor, while other ongoing operations include peacekeeping on Bougainville, in the Sinai, and in the Solomon Islands.
Humanitarian relief after 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake in Aceh Province, Indonesia, Operation Sumatra Assist, ended on 24 March 2005.
Current organisation.
The 1st Division comprises a deployable headquarters, while 2nd Division under the command of Forces Command is the main home-defence formation, containing Army Reserve units.
2nd Division's headquarters only performs administrative functions.
The Australian Army has not deployed a divisional-sized formation since 1945 and does not expect to do so in the future.
1st Division.
1st Division carries out high-level training activities and deploys to command large-scale ground operations.
It does not have any combat units permanently assigned.
Forces Command.
Forces Command controls for administrative purposes all non-special-forces assets of the Australian Army.
It is neither an operational nor a deployable command.
Additionally, Forces Command includes the following training establishments: Special Forces.
Special Operations Command comprises a command formation of equal status to the other commands in the ADF.
It is a brigade-sized formation responsible for all of Australia's special-forces assets.
Planned restructuring.
Under a restructuring program known as Plan Beersheba announced in late 2011, the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades will be re-formed as combined-arms multi-role manoeuvre brigades with the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (part of the 3rd Brigade) forming the core of a future amphibious force The force will be known as an Amphibious Ready Element and will utilise the former Royal Navy 16,000-tonne auxiliary Bay class landing ship RFA Largs Bay (L3006), bought for $100 million to become HMAS Choules.
Colours, standards and guidons.
Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as "the Colours".
Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units.
The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units.
Artillery units' guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect.
Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units.
As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners.
Units awarded battle honours have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons.
They are a link to the unit's past and a memorial to the fallen.
Artillery do not have Battle Honours – their single Honour is "Ubique" which means "Everywhere" – although they can received Honour Titles.
The Army is the guardian of the National Flag and as such, unlike the Royal Australian Air Force, does not have a flag or Colours.
The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner.
To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General Sir  <START:person> William Deane <END> , presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the Australian War Memorial on 10 March 2001.
The Banner was presented to the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A), Warrant Officer  <START:person> Peter Rosemond <END> .
The Army Banner bears the Australian Coat of Arms on the obverse, with the dates "1901–2001" in gold in the upper hoist.
The reverse bears the "rising sun" badge of the Australian Army, flanked by seven campaign honours on small gold-edged scrolls: South Africa, World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya-Borneo, South Vietnam, and Peacekeeping.
The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.
Personnel.
Strength.
In the 2010–11 financial year the Army had an average strength of 47,135 personnel: 30,235 permanent (regular) and 16,900 active reservists (part-time).
In addition there are another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.
The regular Army is targeted to expand to 31,000 personnel by 2014–15.
Personnel numbers have trended downwards since a peak in 2010–11 with an actual strength of 28,568 full-time personnel.
Army Reserve numbers are 14,662, which does not include Standby Reserves.
This gives the Army a combined strength of 43,230 active personnel for the year 2013–14.
Rank and insignia.
The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the British Army, and carry mostly the same actual insignia.
For officers the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title "Australia".
The Non-Commissioned Officer insignia are the same up until Warrant Officer ranks, where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).
The ranks of the Australian Army are as follows: Bases.
The Army's operational headquarters, Forces Command, is located at Victoria Barracks in Sydney.
The Australian Army's three regular brigades are based at Robertson Barracks near Darwin, Lavarack Barracks in Townsville and Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane.
The Deployable Joint Force Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks.
Other important Army bases include the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey, Queensland, Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney, Lone Pine Barracks in Singleton, New South Wales and Woodside Barracks near Adelaide, South Australia.
The SASR is based at Campbell Barracks Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.
Puckapunyal north of Melbourne houses the Australian Army's Combined Arms Training Centre, Land Warfare Development Centre, and three of the five principal Combat Arms schools.
Further barracks include Steele Barracks in Sydney, Keswick Barracks in Adelaide, and Irwin Barracks at Karrakatta in Perth.
Dozens of Australian Army Reserve depots are located across Australia.

</dl>  Antiderivative  In calculus, an antiderivative, primitive integral or indefinite integral of a function "f" is a differentiable function "F" whose derivative is equal to the original function "f".
This can be stated mathematically as "F"′ "f".
The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration) and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative.
Antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through the fundamental theorem of calculus: the definite integral of a function over an interval is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.
The discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is antidifference.
Example.
The function "F"("x") = "x"3/3 is an antiderivative of "f"("x") = "x"2.
As the derivative of a constant is zero, "x"2 will have an infinite number of antiderivatives; such as "x"3/3, "x"3/3 + 1, "x"3/3 - 2, etc.
Thus, all the antiderivatives of "x"2 can be obtained by changing the value of C in "F"("x") = "x"3/3 + "C"; where "C" is an arbitrary constant known as the constant of integration.
Essentially, the graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are vertical translations of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the value of "C".
In physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant.
The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity because the derivative of a constant term is zero.
This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on).
Uses and properties.
Antiderivatives are important because they can be used to compute definite integrals, using the fundamental theorem of calculus: if "F" is an antiderivative of the integrable function "f" and "f" is continuous over the interval ["a", "b"], then: Because of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function "f" is sometimes called the "general integral" or "indefinite integral" of "f" and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds: If "F" is an antiderivative of "f", and the function "f" is defined on some interval, then every other antiderivative "G" of "f" differs from "F" by a constant: there exists a number "C" such that "G"("x") = "F"("x") + "C" for all "x".
"C" is called the arbitrary constant of integration.
If the domain of "F" is a disjoint union of two or more intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals.
For instance is the most general antiderivative of formula_4 on its natural domain formula_5 Every continuous function "f" has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative "F" is given by the definite integral of "f" with variable upper boundary: Varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives).
This is another formulation of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
There are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions (like polynomials, exponential functions, logarithms, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions and their combinations).
Examples of these are  "From left to right, the first four are the error function, the Fresnel function, the trigonometric integral, and the logarithmic integral function."
See also Differential  <START:person> Galois <END>  theory for a more detailed discussion.
Techniques of integration.
Finding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives.
For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions.
See the article on elementary functions for further information.
There are various methods available: Antiderivatives of non-continuous functions.
Non-continuous functions can have antiderivatives.
While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that: Assuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals: on the closed interval ["a", "b"].
Then "g" must have either a maximum or minimum "c" in the open interval ("a", "b") and so   Antigonid dynasty  The Antigonid dynasty (; Greek: Ἀντιγονίδαι) was a dynasty of Hellenistic kings descended from  <START:person> Alexander the Great <END> 's general  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  I Monophthalmus ("the One-eyed").
History.
Succeeding the Antipatrid dynasty in much of Macedonia,  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria.
His attempts to take control of the whole of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's empire led to his defeat and death at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC.
 <START:person> Antigonus <END> 's son  <START:person> Demetrius <END>  I Poliorcetes survived the battle, and managed to seize control of Macedon itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying as a prisoner of Seleucus I Nicator.
After a period of confusion,  <START:person> Demetrius <END> 's son  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  II Gonatas was able to establish the family's control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states, by 276 BC.
Legacy.
It was one of four dynasties established by  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's successors, the others being the Seleucid dynasty, Ptolemaic dynasty and Attalid dynasty.
The last scion of the dynasty,  <START:person> Perseus <END>  of  <START:person> Macedon <END> , who reigned between 179-168 BC, proved unable to stop the advancing Roman legions and  <START:person> Macedon <END> 's defeat at the Battle of Pydna signaled the end of the dynasty.

The ruling members of the Antigonid dynasty were: The Greek rebel against Rome and last King of Macedonia,  <START:person> Andriscus <END> , claimed to be the son of Perseus.
File archiver  A file archiver is a computer program that combines a number of files together into one archive file, or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage.
File archivers may employ lossless data compression in their archive formats to reduce the size of the archive.
Basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives.
The archive files need to store metadata, at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible.
More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the original timestamps, file attributes or access control lists.
The process of making an archive file is called "archiving" or "packing".
Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed "unarchiving", "unpacking" or "extracting".
Unix archivers.
The Unix tools "ar", "tar", "cpio" act as archivers but not compressors.
Users of the Unix tools use additional compression tools, such as gzip, bzip2, or xz, to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file.
The filename extensions are successively added at each step of this process.
For example, archiving a collection of files with "tar" and then compressing the resulting archive file with "gzip" results a file with codice_1 extension.
This approach has two goals: This approach, however, has disadvantages too: Windows archives.
The built-in archiver of Microsoft Windows as well as third-party archiving software, such as WinZip, WinRAR and 7-zip, often use a graphical user interface.
The last three also offer an optional command-line interface but Windows itself does not.
Windows archivers perform both archiving and compression.
Solid compression may or may not be offered, depending on the product: Windows itself does not support it; WinRAR and 7-zip offer it as an option that can be turned on or off.
Artemis  Artemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities.
Her Roman equivalent is  <START:person> Diana <END> .
Some scholars believe that the name, and indeed the goddess herself, was originally pre-Greek.
Homer refers to her as "Artemis Agrotera, Potnia Theron": "Artemis of the wildland, Mistress of Animals".
The Arcadians believed she was the daughter of Demeter.
In the classical period of Greek mythology, Artemis (Ancient Greek: Ἄρτεμις, ] in Classical Attic) was often described as the daughter of Zeus and  <START:person> Leto <END> , and the twin sister of Apollo.
She was the Hellenic goddess of the hunt, wild animals, wilderness, childbirth, virginity and protector of young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows.
The deer and the cypress were sacred to her.
In later Hellenistic times, she even assumed the ancient role of Eileithyia in aiding childbirth.
Etymology.
The name Artemis ("noun", "feminine") is of unknown or uncertain origin and etymology although various ones have been proposed.
For example according to  <START:person> Jablonski <END> , the name is also Phrygian and could be "compared with the royal appellation "Artemas" of  <START:person> Xenophon <END> .
According to  <START:person> Charles Anthon <END>  the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from *"arta", *"art", *"arte", all meaning "great, excellent, holy," thus Artemis "becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus".
 <START:person> Anton Goebel <END>  "suggests the root στρατ or ῥατ, "to shake," and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter".
 <START:person> Babiniotis <END>  while accepting that the etymology is unknown, states that the name is already attested in Mycenean Greek and is possibly of pre-Hellenic origin.
The name could also be possibly related to Greek "árktos" "bear" (from PIE *"h₂ŕ̥tḱos"), supported by the bear cult that the goddess had in Attica (Brauronia) and the Neolithic remains at the Arkoudiotissa Cave, as well as the story about  <START:person> Callisto <END> , which was originally about Artemis (Arcadian epithet "kallisto"); this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger bear cult found further afield in other Indo-European cultures (e.g.,  <START:person> Gaulish Artio <END> ).
It is believed that a precursor of Artemis was worshiped in Minoan Crete as the goddess of mountains and hunting, Britomartis.
While connection with Anatolian names has been suggested, the earliest attested forms of the name "Artemis" are the Mycenaean Greek 𐀀𐀳𐀖𐀵, "a-te-mi-to" /Artemitos/ and 𐀀𐀴𐀖𐀳, "a-ti-mi-te" /Artimitei/, written in Linear B at Pylos.
 <START:person> R. S. P. Beekes <END>  suggested that the "e"/"i" interchange points to a Pre-Greek origin.
Artemis was venerated in  <START:person> Lydia <END>  as "Artimus".
Ancient Greek writers, by way of folk etymology, and some modern scholars, have linked Artemis (Doric "Artamis") to ἄρταμος, "artamos", i.e. "butcher" or, like  <START:person> Plato <END>  did in "Cratylus", to ἀρτεμής, "artemḗs", i.e. "safe", "unharmed", "uninjured", "pure", "the stainless maiden".
Artemis in mythology.
<poem>  <START:person> Leto <END>  bore Apollon and Artemis, delighting in arrows, Both of lovely shape like none of the heavenly gods, As she joined in love to the Aegis-bearing ruler.
</poem>  <START:person> — Hesiod <END>  ,  "Theogony", lines 918–920 (written in the 7th century BCE) Birth.
Various conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology of the birth of Artemis and her twin brother, Apollo.
All accounts agree, however, that she was the daughter of  <START:person> Zeus <END>  and  <START:person> Leto <END>  and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.
An account by  <START:person> Callimachus <END>  has it that Hera forbade  <START:person> Leto <END>  to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island.
Hera was angry with Zeus, her husband, because he had impregnated  <START:person> Leto <END> .
But the island of  <START:person> Delos <END>  (or Ortygia in the Homeric Hymn to Artemis) disobeyed Hera, and  <START:person> Leto <END>  gave birth there.
In ancient Cretan history  <START:person> Leto <END>  was worshipped at Phaistos and in Cretan mythology  <START:person> Leto <END>  gave birth to Apollo and Artemis at the islands known today as the Paximadia.
A "scholium" of Servius on "Aeneid" iii.
72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia by asserting that  <START:person> Zeus <END>  transformed  <START:person> Leto <END>  into a quail ("ortux") in order to prevent Hera from finding out his infidelity, and  <START:person> Kenneth McLeish <END>  suggested further that in quail form  <START:person> Leto <END>  would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.
The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo.
Most stories depict  <START:person> Artemis <END>  as born first, becoming her mother's mid-wife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.
Childhood.
The childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth.
The "Iliad" reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by Hera, climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.
A poem of Callimachus to the goddess "who amuses herself on mountains with archery" imagines some charming vignettes: according to  <START:person> Callimachus <END> , at three years old, Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her six wishes: to remain always a virgin; to have many names to set her apart from her brother Apollo; to be the Phaesporia or Light Bringer; to have a bow and arrow and a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt; to have sixty "daughters of Okeanos", all nine years of age, to be her choir; and for twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested.
She wished for no city dedicated to her, but to rule the mountains, and for the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.
Artemis believed that she had been chosen by the Fates to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo.
All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity.
Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon.
 <START:person> Callimachus <END>  tells how  <START:person> Artemis <END>  spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of Lipara, where Hephaestus and the Cyclops worked.
Okeanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows.
 <START:person> Callimachus <END>  then tells how Artemis visited Pan, the god of the forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs.
She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot.
Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.
Intimacy.
As a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, Orion, won her heart.
Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.
 <START:person> Alpheus <END> , a river god, was in love with Artemis, but he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart.
So he decides to capture her.
 <START:person> Artemis <END> , who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to  <START:person> Alpheus <END> , but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her.
In another story,  <START:person> Alphaeus <END>  tries to rape Artemis' attendant Arethusa.
Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, Artemis Alphaea in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.
 <START:person> Bouphagos <END> , the son of the Titan Iapetos, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her.
Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.
Sipriotes is a boy, who, either because he accidentally sees Artemis bathing or because he attempts to rape her, is turned into a girl by the goddess.
Actaeon.
Multiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary.
The details vary but at the core they involve a great hunter, Actaeon who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs.
Usually the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master.
Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.
According to the standard modern text on the work,  <START:person> Lamar Ronald Lacey <END> 's "The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies", the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her.
For this hubris he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds.
However, in some surviving versions Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her.
Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she, or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of Semele.
Adonis.
In some versions of the story of  <START:person> Adonis <END> , who was a late addition to Greek mythology during the Hellenistic period, Artemis sent a wild boar to kill  <START:person> Adonis <END>  as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than she.
In other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge.
In later myths,  <START:person> Adonis <END>  had been related as a favorite of Aphrodite, and  <START:person> Aphrodite <END>  was responsible for the death of  <START:person> Hippolytus <END> , who had been a favorite of Artemis.
Therefore, Artemis killed  <START:person> Adonis <END>  to avenge Hippolytus’s death.
In yet another version, Adonis was not killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> , but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.
Orion.
Orion was Artemis' hunting companion.
In some versions, he is killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> , while in others he is killed by a scorpion sent by  <START:person> Gaia <END> .
In some versions, Orion tries to seduce Opis, one of Artemis' followers, and she kills him.
In a version by  <START:person> Aratus <END> , Orion takes hold of Artemis' robe and she kills him in self-defense.
In yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion.
According to  <START:person> Hyginus Artemis <END>  once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as Eos did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END> , who was "protective" of his sister's maidenhood.
The Aloadae.
These twin sons of Iphidemia and Poseidon,  <START:person> Otos <END>  and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age.
They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other.
The growth of the Aloadae never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and Hera and take them as wives.
The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them.
The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.
 <START:person> Callisto <END> .
 <START:person> Callisto <END>  was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants.
As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity.
Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo, gained her confidence, then took advantage of her (or raped her, according to Ovid).
As a result of this encounter she conceived a son,  <START:person> Arcas <END> .
Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear.
Arcas almost killed the bear, but  <START:person> Zeus <END>  stopped him just in time.
Out of pity,  <START:person> Zeus <END>  placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of  <START:person> Callisto <END>  the Bear as a constellation.
Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and  <START:person> Callisto <END>  into the heavens as bears, forming the Ursa Minor and Ursa Major constellations.
Iphigenia and the Taurian Artemis.
Artemis punished Agamemnon after he killed a sacred stag in a sacred grove and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess.
When the Greek fleet was preparing at Aulis to depart for Troy to begin the Trojan War, Artemis becalmed the winds.
The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia.
Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer.
Various myths have been told around what happened after Artemis took her.
Either she was brought to  <START:person> Tauros <END>  and led the priests there, or became Artemis' immortal companion.
 <START:person> Niobe <END> .
A Queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion,  <START:person> Niobe <END>  boasted of her superiority to  <START:person> Leto <END>  because while she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven boys and seven girls,  <START:person> Leto <END>  had only one of each.
When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and  <START:person> Artemis <END>  shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound.
Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl.
Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself.
A devastated  <START:person> Niobe <END>  and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept.
The gods themselves entombed them.
Chione.
 <START:person> Chione <END>  was a princess of Pokis.
She was beloved by two gods, Hermes and Apollo, and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once.
Artemis was furious and killed  <START:person> Chione <END>  with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue.
However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.
Atalanta,  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  and the Meleagrids.
Artemis saved the infant Atalanta from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her.
She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters.
But she later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because people said Atalanta was a better hunter.
This is in some stories.
Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, which Artemis had sent to destroy Calydon because King  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices.
In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood, and was awarded the prize of the skin.
She hung it in a sacred grove at Tegea as a dedication to Artemis.
 <START:person> Meleager <END>  was a hero of Aetolia.
King  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the Calydonian Boar.
After the death of  <START:person> Meleager <END> ,  <START:person> Artemis <END>  turned his grieving sisters, the Meleagrids into guineafowl that Artemis loved very much.

In Nonnus "Dionysiaca", Aura was Greek goddess of breezes and cool air, daughter of Lelantos and Periboia.
She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood.
One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity.
Artemis asked  <START:person> Nemesis <END>  for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by Dionysus.
Aura became a mad and dangerous killer.
When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, Iakhos, was saved by Artemis.
 <START:person> Iakhos <END>  later became an attendant of Demeter and the leader of Eleusinian Mysteries.
Polyphonte.
 <START:person> Polyphonte <END>  was a young woman who fled home preferring the idea of a virginal life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite.
As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear.
The resulting offspring,  <START:person> Agrius <END>  and  <START:person> Oreius <END> , were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus.
Ultimately the whole family were transformed into birds and more specifically ill portents for mankind.
Trojan War.
Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END>  was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times.
In the "Iliad" she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict.
Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out.
As Artemis fled crying to Zeus,  <START:person> Leto <END>  gathered up the bow and arrows.
Artemis played quite a large part in this war.
Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshiped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans.
At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter.
Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke the promise.
Other sources said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger.
Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery.
In some versions of the myth, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into Hecate, goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.
 <START:person> Aeneas <END>  was helped by Artemis,  <START:person> Leto <END> , and Apollo.
Apollo found him wounded by  <START:person> Diomedes <END>  and lifted him to heaven.
There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.
Worship of Artemis.
Artemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout ancient Greece.
Her best known cults were on the island of  <START:person> Delos <END>  (her birthplace), in Attica at Brauron and Mounikhia (near Piraeus), and in Sparta.
She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows, and accompanied by a deer.
The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new military campaign.
Athenian festivals in honor of Artemis included Elaphebolia, Mounikhia, Kharisteria, and Brauronia.
The festival of Artemis Orthia was observed in Sparta.
Pre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron to serve the Goddess for one year.
During this time, the girls were known as "arktoi", or little she-bears.
A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame.
A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes.
Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged.
She demanded that young girls "act the bear" at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.
Virginal  <START:person> Artemis <END>  was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating Ilithyia, since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin.
During the Classical period in Athens, she was identified with  <START:person> Hecate <END> .
Artemis also assimilated Caryatis (Carya).
Epithets.
As  <START:person> Aeginaea <END> , she was worshiped in Sparta; the name means either huntress of chamois, or the wielder of the javelin (αἰγανέα).
She was worshipped at Naupactus as Aetole; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin.
This "Aetolian Artemis" would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of Ozolian Locris, until it was awarded to the Aetolians by  <START:person> Philip II <END>  of Macedon.
 <START:person> Strabo <END>  records another precinct of "Aetolian Artemos" at the head of the Adriatic.
As Agoraea she was the protector of the agora.
As Agrotera, she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters.
In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local Aeginian goddess, Aphaea.
As  <START:person> Potnia Theron <END> , she was the patron of wild animals; Homer used this title.
As  <START:person> Kourotrophos <END> , she was the nurse of youths.
As Locheia, she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives.
She was sometimes known as  <START:person> Cynthia <END> , from her birthplace on Mount Cynthus on  <START:person> Delos <END> , or Amarynthia from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in Euboea.
She was sometimes identified by the name  <START:person> Phoebe <END> , the feminine form of her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END> 's solar epithet Phoebus.
In Sparta the Artemis "Lygodesma" was worshipped.
This epithet means "willow-bound" from the Gr.
"lygos" (λυγός, willow) and "desmos" (δεσμός, bond).
The willow tree appears in several ancient Greek myths and rituals.
Alphaea, Alpheaea, or Alpheiusa (Gr.
Ἀλφαῖα, Ἀλφεαία, or Ἀλφειοῦσα) was an epithet that Artemis derived from the river god  <START:person> Alpheius <END> , who was said to have been in love with her.
It was under this name that she was worshiped at Letrini in Elis, and in Ortygia.
 <START:person> Artemis Alphaea <END>  was associated with the wearing of masks, largely because of the legend that while fleeing the advances of  <START:person> Alpheius <END> , she and her nymphs escaped him by covering their faces.
Festivals.
 <START:person> Artemis <END>  was born at the sixth day, the reason why it was sacred for her.
Artemis in art.
The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as "Potnia Theron" ("Queen of the Beasts"): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard in her hands, or sometimes a leopard and a lion.
This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as Artemis Orthia, with a sanctuary close by Sparta.
In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt, with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow and arrows.
Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a hunting dog or stag.
When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head.
Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of  <START:person> Niobe <END> .
Artemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the crescent moon, such as also found on  <START:person> Luna <END>  and others.
On June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of "Artemis and the Stag" was sold at Sotheby's auction house in New York state by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery for $25.5 million.
Attributes.
According to the Homeric Hymn to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was  <START:person> Khryselakatos <END> , "of the Golden Shaft", and  <START:person> Iokheira <END>  (Showered by Arrows).
The arrows of Artemis could also bring sudden death and disease to girls and women.
Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father.
The bow of Artemis also became the witness of  <START:person> Callisto <END> 's oath of her virginity.
In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.
Artemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer ( <START:person> Elaphoi Khrysokeroi <END> ).
The bridles of her chariot were also made of gold.
Although quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear.
Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear.
The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis, while Artemis with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing.
As a goddess of maiden dances and songs, Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre.
Fauna.
Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself.
On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred.
Deer were also the first animals she captured.
She caught five golden horned deer called  <START:person> Elaphoi Khrysokeroi <END>  and harnessed them to her chariot.
The third labour of Heracles, commanded by  <START:person> Eurystheus <END> , consisted in catching the Cerynitian Hind alive.
Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive.
Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath.
Artemis got her hunting dogs from Pan in the forest of Arcadia.
Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one these dogs were able to hunt even lions.
Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race.
However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.
The sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started with the  <START:person> Brauron <END>  cult.
Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron.
The Byzantine writer  <START:person> Suidos <END>  relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois.
A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens.
They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them.
A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge.
The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague.
The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').
The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame.
In honor of Artemis' skill, they sacrificed it to her.
Oineus and Adonis were both killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> ' boar.
Artemis felt pity for the Meleagrids as they mourned for their lost brother,  <START:person> Meleagor <END> , so she transformed them into Guinea Fowl to be her favorite animals.
Hawks were the favored birds of many of the gods, Artemis included.
Flora.
Palm and Cypress were issued to be her birthplace.
Other plants sacred to Artemis are Amaranth and Asphodel.
Artemis as "the Lady of Ephesus".
At Ephesus in Ionia, Turkey, her temple became one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
It was probably the best known center of her worship except for  <START:person> Delos <END> .
There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through "interpretatio graeca" was worshiped primarily as a mother goddess, akin to the Phrygian goddess  <START:person> Cybele <END> , in an ancient sanctuary where her cult image depicted the "Lady of Ephesus" adorned with multiple rounded breast-like protuberances on her chest.
They have been variously interpreted as multiple accessory breasts, as eggs, grapes, acorns, or even bull testes.
Excavation at the site of the "Artemision" in 1987-88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped amber beads that had adorned the ancient wooden "xoanon".
In Acts of the Apostles, Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint  <START:person> Paul <END> 's preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"”
Of the 121 columns of her temple, only one composite, made up of fragments, still stands as a marker of the temple's location.
The rest were used for making churches, roads, and forts.
Artemis in astronomy.
A minor planet, 105 Artemis; a lunar crater; the Artemis Chasma and the  <START:person> Artemis Corona <END>  have all been named for her.
Artemis is the acronym for "Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol", a large bolometer camera in the submillimeter range that was installed in 2010 at the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.
Alcopop  Alcopop (or cooler in Canadian English or spirit cooler in South Africa) is a colloquial term describing certain flavored alcoholic beverages, including: The term "alcopop" (a portmanteau of the words "alcohol" and "sodapop") is used by advocates of tighter restrictions on alcoholic beverage sales, who argue that the beverages are especially appealing to underage drinkers.
Other terms include FAB (flavored alcoholic beverage), FMB (flavored malt beverage), PPS (pre-packaged spirit or premium packaged spirits), and RTD (ready to drink – Australia and New Zealand).
The alcoholic beverage industry does not use the term "alcopop" using terms like wine cooler.
Description.
There is a large variety of beverages produced and marketed around the world as well as within each market which are described as alcopops.
They tend to be sweet and served in small bottles (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in North America, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Europe), and between 4% and 7% ABV.
In Europe, Canada, and South Africa alcopops tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g.
Smirnoff Ice) or rum (e.g.
Bacardi Breezer).
In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as un-hopped beers, depending on the state in which they are sold.
Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring.
Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks.
There are, however, stronger ones that "are" simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g.
Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.
In the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, although some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model, which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.
According to the US Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB): In some Continental European countries, such as Austria and Germany, bottled beer cocktails and shandies are available, which are being marketed the same way like alcopops.
However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.
History.
Wine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when  <START:person> Bartles <END>  and  <START:person> Jaymes <END>  began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when Bacardi introduced the Breezer.
A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with Two Dogs, DNA Alcoholic Spring Water,  <START:person> Hooper <END> 's Hooch and Zima, which was marketed under the title of "malternative beverage".
Wine coolers were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard.
Later,  <START:person> Mike <END> 's Hard Lemonade was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called "violence against lemons".
Smirnoff also came out with another citrus-flavored malt beverage in the United States in the late 1990s called Smirnoff Ice, which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places.
(In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by Diageo as a PPS.)
Some have expressed concern that such drinks might appeal to children as they tend to be sweet and brightly colored.
Many alcopop advertising campaigns have been criticized as trying to make alcopops appeal to young drinkers.
In the United Kingdom, that led to a media outcry during the mid-1990s as the tabloid press associated alcopops with under-age drinking which damaged sales and would lead to off-licences withdrawing them from their stores.
In response to a complaint from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001.
The agency "found no evidence of intent to target minors with the FMB products, packaging, or advertising.
Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data."
The Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, product placement, and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.
"The Commission’s investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs.
Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing" and found that "the majority of FMB drinkers are over the age of 27."
In December 2003, Ireland raised the tax on alcopops to equal that of spirits, the second highest in Europe.
Germany has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 euro per bottle effective August 1, 2004.
To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to wine coolers, which are being marketed the same way.
Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States).
On May 11, 2008, the Australian Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it inline with the tax on spirits.
There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves, possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives.
This tax was revoked during March 2009 meaning the government had to pay back the 290 million collected on the tax.
The Federal Trade Commission report states, "Further, industry-conducted research on consumers over the age of 21 who use FMBs shows that these consumers generally view the FMBs as substitutes for beer, ... This research also concludes that consumers are not likely to consume more than two or three FMBs on any occasion because of the products’ sweetness.
Alcopop brands.
Alcopop brands are numerous and their alcoholic base vary greatly.
Some notable brands include: Smirnoff Ice,  <START:person> Mike <END> 's Hard Lemonade, Bacardi Breezer, Skyy Blue,  <START:person> Jack Daniel <END> 's Hard Cola and in the UK WKD Original Vodka.
Attempts to discourage "alcopops".
Australia.
The Australian government increased the tax on these drinks under the 2008 budget to the same rate as spirits, volumetrically, in an effort to stop binge drinking.
The tax was criticized by the opposition as a tax grab, and voted down in the Senate on March 18, 2009.
Before its rejection, the tax had already raised at least A$290 million after April 2008.
In April 2009, some Labor party MPs planned to resubmit the tax to the Senate, and it was finally approved in August 2009, increasing the cost of the drinks from $39 to $66 a litre.
A 2013 study concluded that the tax had no impact on binge drinking of the drinks by teenagers.
California.
In 2008 AB 346 was signed into law, a bill which requires manufacturers of "alcopops" to carry a 'warning' label stating "ATTENTION: THIS DRINK CONTAINS ALCOHOL."
This bill was praised by groups advocating against alcohol use by minors and younger adults, since these drinks are sometimes favored by young people due to their flavor.
Germany.
On 1 July 2004 the German government increased the tax on mixed drinks based on spirits (e.g.
vodka, rum) by roughly one Euro per 275-ml-bottle in order to stop teenagers drinking excessively, although those drinks were already prohibited to minors under the age of 18.
This had two implications: The most common alcopops, such as Smirnoff Ice or Bacardi Breezer, were nearly taken off the market.
Other manufacturers changed the recipes of their drinks, replacing spirit alcohols by wine or beer, but with the same ABV, enabling these mixed drinks (which are not "alcopops" under German law) to be sold legally to minors 16 and 17 years of age.
South Africa.
In South Africa, "Spirit Coolers" cannot be sold to persons under the age of 18.
They are only sold at liquor stores.
United Kingdom.
In the UK Secretary of State for Health,  <START:person> Patricia Hewitt <END>  called for a tax increase on such products, although this had not yet happened as of October 2013.
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty or ABMT) was a treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems used in defending areas against ballistic missile-delivered nuclear weapons.
Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.
Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years.
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1997 the United States and four former Soviet republics agreed to succeed to the treaty.
In June 2002 the United States withdrew from the treaty, leading to its termination.
Background.
Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming ICBM warheads.
During this period, the US considered the defense of the US as part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange.
As part of this defense, Canada and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called North American Aerospace Defense Command).
By the early 1950s, US research on the Nike Zeus missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of an operational ABM system.
Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as Sprint to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves.
By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed Sentinel.
In 1967, the US announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive Safeguard.
Soviet doctrine called for development of its own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US.
This was achieved with the operational deployment of the A-35 ABM system and its successors, which remain operational to this day.
The development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time.
An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads.
Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would be economically unfeasible: The defenders required one rocket per incoming warhead, whereas the attackers could place 10 warheads on a single missile at a reasonable cost.
To further protect against ABM systems, the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with decoys; R-36M heavy missiles carried as many as 40.
These decoys would appear as warheads to an ABM, effectively requiring engagement of five times as many targets and rendering defense even less effective.
ABM Treaty.
The United States first proposed an anti-ballistic missile treaty at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference during discussions between U.S. Secretary of Defense  <START:person> Robert McNamara <END>  and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union  <START:person> Alexei Kosygin <END> .
 <START:person> McNamara <END>  argued both that ballistic missile defense could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a first-strike against the nation fielding the defense.
 <START:person> Kosygin <END>  rejected this reasoning.
Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks began in November 1969 (SALT I).
By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems.
Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos.
The treaty was signed during the 1972 Moscow Summit on May 26 by the President of the United States,  <START:person> Richard Nixon <END>  and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,  <START:person> Leonid Brezhnev <END> ; and ratified by the US Senate on August 3, 1972.
The 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site.
The sites were Moscow for the USSR and the North Dakota Safeguard Complex for the US, which was already under construction.
Missiles limited by the treaty.
The Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against "strategic ballistic missiles", without attempting to define "strategic".
It was understood that both ICBMs and SLBMs are obviously "strategic".
Both countries did not intend to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs.
The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.
After the SDI announcement.
On March 23, 1983  <START:person> Ronald Reagan <END>  announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, a research program into ballistic missile defense which would be, "consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty".
The project was a blow to  <START:person> Yuri Andropov <END> 's so-called "peace offensive".
 <START:person> Andropov <END>  said that "It is time they [Washington] stopped... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible.
It is insane".
Regardless of the opposition,  <START:person> Reagan <END>  gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system.
The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible.
In "The Nuclear Predicament,"  <START:person> Beckman <END>  claims that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI.
A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a “ragged” Soviet retaliatory response.
Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy.
The Soviets could not afford to ignore  <START:person> Reagan <END> ’s new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans.
By 1987, however, the USSR withdrew its opposition, concluding the SDI posed no threat and scientifically "would never work."
SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result.
SDI research was cut back following the end of  <START:person> Reagan <END> 's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that "missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability."
This was reaffirmed in 1997.
US withdrawal.
Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, in the view of the U.S. Department of State, the treaty continued in force.
An additional memorandum of understanding was prepared in 1997, establishing Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine as successor states to the Soviet Union, for the purposes of the treaty.
On December 13, 2001,  <START:person> George W. Bush <END>  gave Russia notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact—the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.
This led to the eventual creation of the American Missile Defense Agency.
Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited National Missile Defense to protect the United States from nuclear blackmail by a rogue state.
The withdrawal had many critics as well as supporters.
 <START:person> John Rhinelander <END> , a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a "fatal blow" to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and would lead to a "world without effective legal constraints on nuclear proliferation."
The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear first strike.
Russia and the United States signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty in Moscow on May 24, 2002.
This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.

Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  1974 Protocol   Acts of Union 1707  The Acts of Union were two Acts of Parliament: the Union with Scotland Act 1706 passed by the Parliament of England, and the Union with England Act passed in 1707 by the Parliament of Scotland.
They put into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries.
The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate states with separate legislatures, but with the same monarch) into a single, united kingdom named "Great Britain".
The two countries had shared a monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King  <START:person> James VI <END>  of Scotland inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, Queen  <START:person> Elizabeth I. <END> 
Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later Kingdom of Great Britain).
There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.
The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707.
On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the Parliament of Great Britain, based in the Palace of Westminster in London, the home of the English Parliament.
Hence, the Acts are referred to as the Union of the Parliaments.
On the Union, the historian  <START:person> Simon Schama <END>  said "What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."
Historical background.
Previous attempts at union.
England and Scotland were separate states for several centuries before eventual union, and English attempts to take over Scotland by military force in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were ultimately unsuccessful (see the Wars of Scottish Independence).
The first attempts at Union surrounded the foreseen unification of the Royal lines of Scotland and England.
In pursuing the Scottish throne in the 1560s,  <START:person> Mary <END> , Queen of Scots pledged herself to a peaceful union between the two kingdoms.
England and Scotland were ruled by the same king for the first time in 1603 when  <START:person> James VI <END>  of Scotland also became the king of England.
However they remained two separate states until 1 May 1707.
Early  <START:person> Stuart <END>  union.
The first attempt to unite the parliaments of England and Scotland was by  <START:person> Mary <END> 's son, King  <START:person> James VI <END>  and I. On his accession to the English throne in 1603 King  <START:person> James <END>  announced his intention to unite his two realms so that he would not be "guilty of bigamy".
 <START:person> James <END>  used his Royal prerogative powers to take the style of 'King of Great Britain' and to give an explicitly British character to his court and person.
Whilst  <START:person> James <END>  assumed the creation of a full union was a foregone conclusion, the Parliament of England was concerned that the formation of a new state would deprive England of its ancient liberties, taking on the more absolutist monarchical structure  <START:person> James <END>  had previously enjoyed in Scotland.
In the meantime,  <START:person> James <END>  declared that Great Britain be viewed 'as presently united, and as one realm and kingdom, and the subjects of both realms as one people'.
The Scottish and English parliaments established a commission to negotiate a union, formulating an instrument of union between the two countries.
However, the idea of political union was unpopular, and when  <START:person> James <END>  dropped his policy of a speedy union, the topic quietly disappeared from the legislative agenda.
When the House of Commons attempted to revive the proposal in 1610, it was met with a more open hostility.
Union during the interregnum.
The Solemn League and Covenant 1643 sought a forced union of the Church of England into the Church of Scotland, and although the covenant referred repeatedly to union between the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a political union was not spelled out.
In the aftermath of the Civil War, in which the Covenanters had fought for the King,  <START:person> Oliver Cromwell <END>  occupied Scotland and began a process of creating a 'Godly Britannic' Union between the former Kingdoms.
In 1651, the Parliament of England issued the Tender of Union declaration supporting Scotland's incorporation into the Commonwealth and sent Commissioners to Scotland with the express purpose of securing support for Union, which was assented to by the Commissioners (Members of Parliament) in Scotland.
On 12 April 1654,  <START:person> Cromwell <END>  – styling himself Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland – enacted "An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland," which created 'one Commonwealth and under one Government' to be known as the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.
The ordinance was ratified by the Second Protectorate Parliament, as an Act of Union, on 26 June 1657.
One united Parliament sat in Westminster, with 30 representatives from Scotland and 30 from Ireland joining the existing members from England.
Whilst free trade was brought about amongst the new Commonwealth, the economic benefits were generally not felt as a result of heavy taxation used to fund  <START:person> Cromwell <END> 's New Model Army.
This republican union was dissolved automatically with the restoration of King  <START:person> Charles II <END>  to the thrones of England and Scotland.
Scottish members expelled from the Commonwealth Parliament petitioned unsuccessfully for a continuance of the union.
 <START:person> Cromwell <END> 's union had simultaneously raised interest in and suspicion of the concept of union and when  <START:person> Charles II <END>  attempted to recreate the union and fulfil the work of his grandfather in 1669, negotiations between Commissioners ground to a halt.
Later attempts.
An abortive scheme for union occurred in Scotland in 1670.
Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the records of the Parliament of Scotland show much discussion of possible union.
 <START:person> William <END>  and  <START:person> Mary <END> , whilst supportive of the idea, had no interest in allowing it to delay their enthronement.
Impetus for this incorporating union came almost entirely from King  <START:person> William <END> , who feared leaving Scotland open to a French invasion.
In the 1690s, the economic position of Scotland worsened, and relations between Scotland and England became strained.
In the following decade, however, union again became a significant topic of political debate.
Treaty and passage of the Acts of 1707.
Deeper political integration had been a key policy of Queen  <START:person> Anne <END>  from the time she acceded to the throne in 1702.
Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.
Both countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations.
Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials.
At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Seafield.
The English commissioners included the Lord High Treasurer, the Earl of Godolphin, the Lord Keeper,  <START:person> Baron Cowper <END> , and a large number of Whigs who supported union.
Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.
Negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the Cockpit in London.
Each side had its own particular concerns.
Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the Hanoverian dynasty would succeed  <START:person> Queen Anne <END>  to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.
After negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments.
In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the Parliament of Scotland were supportive of the Court Party.
For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the  <START:person> Squadrone Volante <END> , led by the Marquess of Montrose and the Duke of Roxburghe.
Opponents of the court were generally known as the Country party, and included various factions and individuals such as the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Belhaven and  <START:person> Andrew Fletcher <END>  of  <START:person> Saltoun <END> , who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union.
The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the Darien Disaster.
In Scotland, the Duke of Queensberry was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the Scottish Parliament.
In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action.
He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself.
In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road.
From Barnet, the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed.
On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at Kensington Palace.
Political motivations.
English perspective.
The English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne.
The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England.
The English succession was provided for by the English Act of Settlement 1701, which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the House of Hanover.
Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after Queen  <START:person> Anne <END> : the Scottish Act of Security 1704 granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation.
Many people in England were unhappy about the prospect, however.
English overseas possessions made England very wealthy in comparison to Scotland, a poor country with few roads, very little industry and almost no Navy.
This made some view unification as a markedly unequal relationship.
Scottish perspective.
In Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the Darien scheme through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the Alien Act to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.
The combined votes of the Court party with a majority of the  <START:person> Squadrone Volante <END>  were sufficient to ensure the final passage of the treaty through the House.
Personal financial interests were also allegedly involved.
Many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien Scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 15 granted £398,085 10s sterling to Scotland, a sum known as The Equivalent, to offset future liability towards the English national debt.
In essence it was also used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien Scheme, as 58.6% was allocated to its shareholders and creditors.
Even more direct bribery was also said to be a factor.
£20,000 (£240,000 Scots) was dispatched to Scotland for distribution by the Earl of Glasgow.
 <START:person> James Douglas <END> , 2nd  <START:person> Duke of Queensberry <END> , the Queen's Commissioner in Parliament, received £12,325, more than 60% of the funding.
(Some contend that all of this money was properly accounted for as compensation for loss of office, pensions and so forth not outwith the usual run of government.
It is perhaps a debate that will never be set to rest.
However, modern research has shown that payments were made to supporters of union that appear not to have been overdue salaries.
At least four payments were made to people who were not even members of the Scottish Parliament.)
 <START:person> Robert Burns <END>  referred to this: <poem>We're bought and sold for English Gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.</poem>
Some of the money was used to hire spies, such as  <START:person> Daniel Defoe <END> ; his first reports were of vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union.
"A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind," he reported, "for every Scot in favour there is 99 against".
Years later Sir  <START:person> John Clerk of Penicuik <END> , originally a leading Unionist, wrote in his memoirs that, ( <START:person> Defoe <END> ) was a spy among us, but not known as such, otherwise the Mob of Edinburgh would pull him to pieces.
 <START:person> Defoe <END>  recalls that he was hired by  <START:person> Robert Harley <END> .
The Treaty could be considered unpopular in Scotland: Sir  <START:person> George Lockhart <END>  of Carnwath, the only member of the Scottish negotiating team against union, noted that "The whole nation appears against the Union" and even Sir  <START:person> John Clerk of Penicuik <END> , an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was "contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom".
Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes.
The Convention of Royal Burghs also petitioned against the Union as proposed: That it is our indispensable duty to signify to your grace that, as we are not against an honourable and safe union with England far less can we expect to have the condition of the people of Scotland, with relation to these great concerns, made better and improved without a Scots Parliament.
Not one petition in favour of an incorporating union was received by Parliament.
On the day the treaty was signed, the carilloner in St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune "Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?" Threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing martial law.
Irish perspective.
Ireland, the third of the "sister kingdoms", was not included in the union.
The effective government of Ireland was in the hands of the 'Protestant Ascendancy', a minority elite (about 10% of the population).
The Roman Catholic majority were systematically excluded from political and military discourse through a series of post-Cromwellian Penal Laws, limiting their rights to property, education, and the franchise.
In July 1707 each House of the Parliament of Ireland passed a congratulatory address to  <START:person> Queen Anne <END> , praying that "May God put it in your royal heart to add greater strength and lustre to your crown, by a still more comprehensive Union".
The British government did not respond to the invitation and an equal union between Great Britain and Ireland was out of consideration until the 1790s.
Ireland's benefits from the Union of 1707 were therefore few.
Its preferential status in trade with England now extended to Scotland.
However, Ireland was left unequal and unrepresented in the Parliament of Great Britain.
The Kingdom of Ireland was to remain separate, and legally subordinate to Great Britain until 1784.
The union with Ireland finally came about on 1 January 1801.
Provisions of the Acts.
The Treaty of Union, agreed between representatives of the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature.
In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees.
Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706.
To minimise the opposition of the Church of Scotland, an Act was also passed to secure the Presbyterian establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy.
The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.
The two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send representative peers from the Peerage of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords.
It guaranteed that the Church of Scotland would remain the established church in Scotland, that the Court of Session would "remain in all time coming within Scotland", and that Scots law would "remain in the same force as before".
Other provisions included the restatement of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the ban on Roman Catholics from taking the throne.
It also created a customs union and monetary union.
The Act provided that any "laws and statutes" that were "contrary to or inconsistent with the terms" of the Act would "cease and become void."
Soon after the Union, the Act 6  <START:person> Anne <END>  c.40 (later infelicitously named the Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707) united the English and Scottish Privy Councils and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration.
In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the College of Justice.
Criticisms.
The English and Scottish parliaments had evolved along different lines; especially, the Parliament of Scotland had been unicameral while that of England had been bicameral.
Following Union, the parliament at Westminster followed the English model.
 <START:person> Defoe <END>  drew upon his Scottish experience to write his "Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Britain", published in 1726, where he admitted that the increase of trade and population in Scotland, which he had predicted as a consequence of the Union, was "not the case, but rather the contrary".
However, by the time  <START:person> Samuel Johnson <END>  and  <START:person> James Boswell <END>  made their tour in 1773, recorded in "A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland",  <START:person> Johnson <END>  noted that Scotland was "a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing" and in particular that Glasgow had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.
300th anniversary.
A commemorative two-pound coin was issued to mark the tercentennial—300th anniversary—of the Union, which occurred two days before the Scottish Parliament general election on 3 May 2007.
The Scottish Executive held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the National Museums of Scotland and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the National Galleries of Scotland.
Scottish voting records.
<noinclude>   <START:person> Arthur Jensen  Arthur Robert Jensen <END>  (August 24, 1923 – October 22, 2012) was a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was known for his work in psychometrics and differential psychology, which is concerned with how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.
He was a major proponent of the hereditarian position in the nature and nurture debate, the position that genetics play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as intelligence and personality.
He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals and sat on the editorial boards of the scientific journals "Intelligence" and "Personality and Individual Differences".
He was rated as one of the 50 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century.
He was also a controversial figure, largely for his conclusions regarding the causes of race-based differences in intelligence.
Early life.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was born August 24, 1923, in San Diego, California, the son of  <START:person> Linda Mary <END>  (née Schachtmayer) and  <START:person> Arthur Alfred Jensen <END> , who operated and owned a lumber and building materials company.
His paternal grandparents were Danish immigrants and his mother was of half Polish Jewish and half German descent.
He studied at University of California, Berkeley (B.A. 1945), San Diego State College (M.A., 1952) and Columbia University (Ph.D., 1956), and did his doctoral thesis with  <START:person> Percival Symonds <END>  on the Thematic Apperception Test: He published this work.
From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the University of London, Institute of Psychiatry with  <START:person> Hans Eysenck <END> .
Upon returning to the United States, he became a researcher and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of culture, development, and genetics on intelligence and learning.
He received tenure at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first sabbatical in 1964.
He has concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students.
In 2003, he was awarded the Kistler Prize for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human genome and human society.
In 2006, the International Society for Intelligence Research awarded  <START:person> Jensen <END>  its Lifetime Achievement Award.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  has had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a conductor himself.
At 14, he conducted a band that won a nationwide contest held in San Francisco.
Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a seminar given by  <START:person> Nikolai Sokoloff <END> .
Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to New York, mainly to be near the conductor  <START:person> Arturo Toscanini <END> .
He was also deeply interested in the life and example of  <START:person> Gandhi <END> , producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life.
During  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's period in San Diego he spent time working as a social worker with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.
IQ and academic achievement.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children.
The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability.
"Level I", or associative learning, may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills.
"Level II", or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.
Later,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the general factor of intelligence, a concept which was essentially synonymous with his "Level II" conceptual learning.
The general factor, or "g", is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  claimed, on the basis of his research, that general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait, determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions.
He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.
He suggested that from the data one might conclude that, on average, European Americans are more intelligent than African Americans.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the "Harvard Educational Review", was titled "How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?"
It concluded, among other things, that Head Start programs designed to boost African-American IQ scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.
The work became one of—if not the most—cited papers in the history of psychological testing and intelligence research.
After the paper was released, students and faculty staged large protests outside  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's U.C. Berkeley office.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was denied reprints of his work by his publisher and was not permitted to reply in response to letters of criticism—both extremely unusual policies for their day.
In a later article,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  argued that his claims had been misunderstood: ...nowhere have I "claimed" an "innate deficiency" of intelligence in blacks.
My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: "The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations.
The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question."
( <START:person> Jensen <END> , 1981a, p. 213).
 <START:person> Thomas Sowell <END>  wrote: Professor  <START:person> Jensen <END>  pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him.
He did this because "I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate."
What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor  <START:person> Jensen <END>  has had.
However,  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's 1998 "" gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ.
In Chapter 12: Population Differences in "g": Causal Hypotheses,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  writes: The relationship of the g factor to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e.,  <START:person> Spearman <END> 's hypothesis) suggests that the average white-black difference in "g" has a biological component.
Human races are viewed not as discrete, or Platonic, categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes.
The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies.
Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly "g".
In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on "Mainstream Science on Intelligence, " an editorial written by  <START:person> Linda Gottfredson <END>  and published in the "Wall Street Journal", which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the meaning and significance of IQ following the publication of the book "The Bell Curve".
In 2005,  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's article, co-written with  <START:person> J. Philippe Rushton <END> , named "Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability", was published in the APA journal "Psychology, Public Policy and Law".
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  and  <START:person> Rushton <END>  present ten categories of evidence in support of the notion that IQ differences between whites and blacks are partly genetic in origin.
Death.
He died on October 22, 2012 at his home in Kelseyville, California at age 89.
Criticism.
 <START:person> Melvin Konner <END>  wrote in the notes to his book "The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit": Statements made by  <START:person> Arthur Jensen <END> ,  <START:person> William Shockley <END> , and other investigators in the late 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions.
Many of these statements were proved wrong, but they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence is very difficult to recant.
Many studies that purport to be both science-based and attempt to influence public policy have been accused of scientific racism.
 <START:person> Konner <END>  wrote: What of the latest currents of thought?
Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy?
The indications are not all encouraging.
 <START:person> Richard Herrnstein <END>  and  <START:person> Charles Murray <END>  published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as  <START:person> Jensen <END>  and others had in the 1960s and 1970s.
"The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life" (New York: Free Press 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the racial divide in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.
Their general assertions about genes and IQ were not very controversial, but their speculations on race were something else again.
By 1994, the time of The Bell Curve's publishing,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  had received $1.1 million from the Pioneer Fund, an organization frequently described as racist and "white supremacist" in nature.
The fund contributed a total of $3.5 million to researchers cited in The Bell Curve's most controversial chapter "that suggests some races are naturally smarter than others" with  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's works being cited twenty-three times in the book's bibliography.
 <START:person> Lisa Suzuki <END>  and  <START:person> Joshua Aronson <END>  of New York University claimed in 2005 that  <START:person> Jensen <END>  has largely ignored evidence that fails to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent a genetic racial hierarchy unwaveringly for over 30 years.
Paleontologist and evolutionary biologist  <START:person> Stephen Jay Gould <END>  attacked  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's work in his 1981 book "The Mismeasure of Man".
 <START:person> Gould <END>  writes that  <START:person> Jensen <END>  misapplies the concept of "heritability", which is defined as a measure of the variation of a trait due to inheritance "within" a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156-157).
According to  <START:person> Gould <END> ,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  uses heritability to measure differences "between" populations.
 <START:person> Gould <END>  also disagrees with  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, "g", or "the general factor common to a large number of cognitive abilities" which can be measured along a unilinear scale.
This is a claim most closely identified with  <START:person> Charles Spearman <END> .
According to  <START:person> Gould <END> ,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  misunderstood the research of  <START:person> L. L. Thurstone <END>  to ultimately support this claim;  <START:person> Gould <END> , however, argues that  <START:person> Thurstone <END> 's factor analysis of intelligence revealed "g" to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314).
 <START:person> Gould <END>  criticizes  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's sources including his use of  <START:person> Catharine Cox <END> 's 1926 "Genetic Studies of Genius", which examines historiometrically the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths ( <START:person> Gould <END>  1981: 153-154).
In 1980  <START:person> Jensen <END>  published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled "Bias in Mental Testing".
Reviewing this book, psychologist  <START:person> Kenneth Kaye <END>  endorsed  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's distinction between bias and discrimination.
The purpose of tests is to discriminate (that is, reveal actual differences) on the basis of ability; bias constitutes error.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  defined any test as biased for a particular group if that group differs significantly from the majority group in the slopes, intercepts, or standard error of the estimates of their regression lines.
Most studies found no difference in the regression lines between black and white groups, but those differences that had been found to be biased had overpredicted rather than underpredicted the minority group's performance (for example, grades in Officer Candidate courses).
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's conclusion: Until we find out what the relevant psychological predictors are for which racial classification per se is merely a 'stand-in' variable, we have no choice but to include race (or other group membership) as a predictive variable along with the test scores or other predictive measures.
On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.
Pointing out that "many of  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's opponents allowed their scientific conclusions to be far more biased by their political views than he did,  <START:person> Kaye <END>  quoted 18th-century  <START:person> David Hume <END> : "There is no Method of Reasoning more Common, and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical Debates, to endeavor the Refutation of any Hypothesis, by a Pretext of its dangerous Consequences to Religion and Morality."
In a 1982 review of "The Mismeasure of Man",  <START:person> Jensen <END>  gives point-by-point rebuttals to much of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's critique, including  <START:person> Gould <END> 's treatment of heritability, the "reification" of "g", and the use of Thurstone's analysis.
 <START:person> Gould <END>  responded to  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's rebuttals in a revised edition of the book, published in 1996.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's response and criticism.
In  <START:person> Arthur Jensen <END> 's response to  <START:person> Gould <END> 's criticisms, in the paper titled "The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons".,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  begins his paper with this observation  <START:person> Stephen Jay Gould <END>  is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, "Biology as a Social Weapon."
Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book.
Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of  <START:person> Gould <END>  when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist  <START:person> Edward O. Wilson <END> , a leader in the development of sociobiology...
While  <START:person> Jensen <END>  recognizes the validity of some of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's claims, in many places, he criticizes  <START:person> Gould <END> 's general approach This charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth.
In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the Marxist interpretation of the history of science.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  adds that  <START:person> Gould <END>  made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's own positions In his references to my own work,  <START:person> Gould <END>  includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's opinion; in these citations  <START:person> Gould <END>  purportedly paraphrases my views.
Yet in eight of the nine cases,  <START:person> Gould <END> 's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured.
Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources.
While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears  <START:person> Gould <END> 's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner,  <START:person> James R. Flynn <END> : Now and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue?
The name  <START:person> James R. Flynn <END>  is by far the first that comes to mind.
His book, "Race, IQ and  <START:person> Jensen <END> " (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.
Books.
The "g" Factor.
"" (1998) is a book on the general intelligence factor ("g").
The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.
Clocking the Mind.
"Clocking the Mind : Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences" (2006) deals with mental chronometry (MC), and covers a variety of techniques for measuring the speed with which the brain processes information.
Whereas IQ merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability.
Amyl nitrite  Amyl nitrite is the chemical compound with the formula C5H11ONO.
A variety of isomers are known, but they all feature an amyl group attached to the nitrite functional group.
The alkyl group is unreactive and the chemical and biological properties are mainly due to the nitrite group.
Like other alkyl nitrites, amyl nitrite is bioactive in mammals, being a vasodilator, which is the basis of its use as a prescription medicine.
As an inhalant, it also has a psychoactive effect, which has led to its recreational use.
Nomenclature.
The term "amyl nitrite" encompasses several isomers.
For example, a common form of amyl nitrite with the formula (CH3)2CHCH2CH2ONO may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite.
When the amyl group is a linear or normal (n) alkyl group, the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH3(CH2)4ONO.
Despite a very similar name to amyl nitrite, amyl nitrate has a different chemical composition and different properties.
Synthesis and reactions.
Alkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of alcohols with nitrous acid: The reaction is called esterification.
Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories.
A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol.
The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrous and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily decanted from the reaction mixture.
Isoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the isoamyl alcohol: Amyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with carbanions to give oximes.
Amyl nitrites are also useful as reagents in a modification of the  <START:person> Sandmeyer <END>  reaction.
The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic amine in a halogenated solvent produces a radical aromatic species, this then abstracts a halogen atom from the solvent.
For the synthesis of aryl iodides diiodomethane is used, whereas bromoform is the solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl bromides.
Physiological effects.
Amyl nitrite, in common with other alkyl nitrites, is a potent vasodilator; it expands blood vessels, resulting in lowering of the blood pressure.
Alkyl nitrites are a source of nitric oxide, which signals for relaxation of the involuntary muscles.
Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the blood vessel walls and the internal and external anal sphincter.
There are no withdrawal symptoms.
Overdose symptoms include nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypoventilation, shortness of breath, and fainting.
The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear within a few minutes.
Amyl nitrate may also intensify the experience of synesthesia.
Applications.
Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat heart diseases such as angina.
It is also used as an inhalant drug that induces a brief euphoric state, and when combined with other intoxicant stimulant drugs such as cocaine or ecstasy (see MDMA), the euphoric state intensifies and is prolonged.
Once some stimulative drugs wear off, a common side effect is a period of depression or anxiety, colloquially called a "come down"; amyl nitrite is sometimes used to combat these negative after-effects.
This effect, combined with its dissociative effects, has led to its use as a recreational drug (see poppers).
Amyl nitrite is also sometimes used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning.
It can act as an oxidant, to induce the formation of methemoglobin.
Methemoglobin in turn can sequester cyanide as cyanomethemoglobin.
Alexandria Troas  Alexandria Troas ("Alexandria of the Troad"; Greek: Αλεξάνδρεια Τρωάς; Turkish: "Eski Stambul") is the site of an ancient Greek city situated on the Aegean Sea near the northern tip of Turkey's western coast, a little south of Tenedos (modern Bozcaada).
It is located southeast of modern Dalyan, a village in the Ezine district of Çanakkale Province.
The site sprawls over an estimated 400 ha; among the few structures remaining today are a ruined bath, an odeon, a theatre, gymnasium complex and a recently uncovered stadion.
The circuit of the old walls can still be traced.
History.
Hellenistic.
According to  <START:person> Strabo <END> , this site was first called Sigeia; around 306 BC Antigonus refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia, including the once influential city of Neandreia.
It did not receive its name until its name was changed by  <START:person> Lysimachus <END>  to Alexandria Troas, in 301 BC, in memory of  <START:person> Alexander III of Macedon <END>  ( <START:person> Pliny <END>  merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria).
As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a "free and autonomous city" as early as 188 BC, and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance.
In its heyday the city may have had a population of about 100,000.
 <START:person> Strabo <END>  mentions that a Roman colony was created at the location in the reign of Augustus, named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period).
 <START:person> Augustus <END> ,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  and the rich grammarian  <START:person> Herodes Atticus <END>  contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter.
 <START:person> Constantine <END>  considered making Troas the capital of the Roman Empire.
Roman.
In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between Anatolia and Europe.
 <START:person> Paul <END>  of Tarsus sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of Eutychus later occurred).
 <START:person> Ignatius <END>  of Antioch also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.
Byzantine.
Several of its later bishops are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344;  <START:person> Sylvanus <END>  at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451;  <START:person> Leo <END>  in 787;  <START:person> Peter <END> , friend of the Patriarch  <START:person> Ignatius <END> , and adversary to  <START:person> Michael <END> , in the ninth century.
In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of Cyzicus and distinct from the famous Troy ( <START:person> Heinrich Gelzer <END> , "Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum", 552; "Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani", 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared.
The bishopric remains a titular see of the Catholic Church under the name Troas, vacant since 1971.
Troas is also a titular see of the Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
Bishop  <START:person> Savas <END>  ( <START:person> Zembillas <END> ) of  <START:person> Troas <END>  served as hierarch from 2002 to 2011, and then became Metropolitan  <START:person> Savas <END>  ( <START:person> Zembillas <END> ) of Pittsburgh in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.
Ottoman.
Karasid Turkomans settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century.
Their "beylik" was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336.
The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as " <START:person> Eski Stambul <END> ", the "Old City".
The site's stones were much plundered for building material (for example  <START:person> Mehmed IV <END>  took columns to adorn his Yeni Valide Mosque in Istanbul).
As of the mid-18th century the site served as "a lurking place for bandetti".
Modern.
By 1911, the site had been overgrown with vallonea oaks and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved.
They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals.
Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as "Bal Saray" (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by  <START:person> Herodes Atticus <END>  in the year 135.
 <START:person> Trajan <END>  built an aqueduct which can still be traced.
The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand.
It is the subject of an early twenty-first century study by German archaeologists digging and surveying at the site.
Their excavation uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100 BC.
Epsilon Ursae Majoris  Epsilon Ursae Majoris (Epsilon UMa, ε Ursae Majoris, ε UMa) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Major (despite its Bayer designation being merely "epsilon"), and at magnitude 1.76 is the thirty-first brightest star in the sky.
It has the traditional name Alioth.
It is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body, and thus the star in the handle of the Big Dipper (Plough) closest to the bowl.
It is also a member of the large and diffuse Ursa Major moving group.
Historically, the star was frequently used in celestial navigation in the maritime trade, because it is listed as one of the 57 navigational stars.[1]
Peculiarities.
According to "Hipparcos",  <START:person> Alioth <END>  is 81 light years (25 parsecs) from Earth.
Its spectral type is A0p; the "p" stands for "peculiar", as the spectrum of its light is characteristic of an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable.
 <START:person> Alioth <END> , as a representative of this type, may harbor two interacting processes.
First, the star's strong magnetic field separating different elements in the star's hydrogen 'fuel'.
In addition, a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis may be spinning different bands of magnetically sorted elements into the line of sight between Alioth and the Earth.
The intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of light as they whip in and out of view, causing Alioth to have very strange spectral lines that fluctuate over a period of 5.1 days.
With  <START:person> Alioth <END> , the rotational and magnetic axes are at almost 90 degrees to one another.
Darker (denser) regions of chromium form a band at right angles to the equator.
A recent study suggests  <START:person> Alioth <END> 's 5.1-day variation may be due to a substellar object of about 14.7 Jupiter masses in an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) with an average separation of 0.055 astronomical units.
 <START:person> Alioth <END>  has a relatively weak magnetic field, 15 times weaker than α CVn, but it is still 100 times stronger than that of the Earth.
Namesakes.
USS Allioth (AK-109) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.
Arianespace  Arianespace SA is a European multinational company founded in 1980 as the world's first commercial launch service provider.
Seated in France, it undertakes the production, operation, and marketing of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle as part of the Ariane programme.
Two other launch systems are offered by the company, the Soyuz-2 as a medium-lift alternative to Ariane 5, and the Vega as a lighter one.
s of 2004[ [update]], Arianespace held more than 50 percent of the world market for boosting satellites to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).
More than 240 commercial launches have occurred since May 22, 1984, and Arianespace states that the total number of launch contracts signed since Ariane launches commenced operations in 1984 is 285.
Arianespace uses the Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guiana as a launch site.
It has its headquarters in Courcouronnes, Essonne, France, near Évry.
On 21 October 2011 Arianespace launched the first Soyuz rocket ever from outside former Soviet territory.
The payload was two Galileo navigation satellites.
The company and its infrastructure.
Arianespace primary shareholders are its suppliers, in the various nations of the European Union.
Arianespace currently has 21 shareholders: Competition and pricing.
The disruptive force represented in new sector entrant SpaceX, forced Arianespace to cut workforce, and focus on cost-cutting, to decrease costs to remain competitive against the new low-cost entrant in the launch sector.
According to one Arianespace managing director, ""It's quite clear there's a very significant challenge coming from SpaceX," he said.
"Therefore things have to change … and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined."
In the midst of pricing pressure from U.S. company SpaceX, Arianespace made a November 2013 announcement of pricing flexibility for the "lighter satellites" it carries to Geostationary orbits aboard its Ariane 5.
In early 2014, Arianespace requested additional subsidies from European governments to face the competition from SpaceX and unfavorable changes in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate.
Reducing pricing allowed Arianespace to sign four additional contracts in September 2014 for a lower slots on an Ariane 5 SYLDA dispenser for the satellites that otherwise could be flown on SpaceX launch vehicle.
Overall Arianespace signed 11 contracts in 2014 until September with two additional being in a late stage of negotiations.
s of September 2014[ [update]] Arianespace has a backlog of launches worth € billion with 38 satellites to be launched on Ariane 5, 7 on Soyuz and 9 on  <START:person> Vega <END> , claiming 60% of global satellite launch market.
By November 2014, SpaceX had "already begun to take market share" from Arianespace, and Eutelsat CEO  <START:person> Michel de Rosen <END> —a major customer of Arianespace—said that "Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through economies of scale."
Launch Vehicles.
Currently Arianespace operates 3 launch vehicles, including two versions of Ariane 5: Additionally Arianespace offers optional back-up launch service on H-IIA through Launch Services Alliance.
Ariane launch vehicles.
Since the first launch in 1979, there have been several versions of the Ariane launch vehicle:  Advanced Power Management  Advanced power management (APM) is an API developed by Intel and Microsoft and released in 1992 which enables an operating system running an IBM-compatible personal computer to work with the BIOS (part of the computer's firmware) to achieve power management.
Revision 1.2 was the last version of the APM specification, released in 1996.
ACPI is intended as the successor to APM.
Microsoft dropped support for APM in Windows Vista.
The Linux kernel still mostly supports APM, with the last fully functional APM support shipping in 3.3.
Overview.
APM uses a layered approach to manage devices.
APM-aware applications (which include device drivers) talk to an OS-specific APM driver.
This driver communicates to the APM-aware BIOS, which controls the hardware.
There is the ability to opt out of APM control on a device-by-device basis, which can be used if a driver wants to communicate directly with a hardware device.
Communication occurs both ways; power management events are sent from the BIOS to the APM driver, and the APM driver sends information and requests to the BIOS via function calls.
In this way the APM driver is an intermediary between the BIOS and the operating system.
Power management happens in two ways; through the above-mentioned function calls from the APM driver to the BIOS requesting power state changes, and automatically based on device activity.
Power management events.
There are 12 power events (such as standby, suspend and resume requests, and low battery notifications), plus OEM-defined events, that can be sent from the APM BIOS to the operating system.
The APM driver regularly polls for event change notifications.
Power Management Events: Power management functions: APM functions.
There are 21 APM function calls defined that the APM driver can use to query power management statuses, or request power state transitions.
Example function calls include letting the BIOS know about current CPU usage (the BIOS may respond to such a call by placing the CPU in a low-power state, or returning it to its full-power state), retrieving the current power state of a device, or requesting a power state change.
Power states.
The APM specification defines system power states and device power states.
System power states.
APM defines five power states for the computer system: Device power states.
APM also defines power states that APM-aware hardware can implement.
There is no requirement that an APM-aware device implement all states.
The four states are: CPU.
The CPU core (defined in APM as the CPU clock, cache, system bus and system timers) is treated specially in APM, as it is the last device to be powered down, and the first device to be powered back up.
The CPU core is always controlled through the APM BIOS (there is no option to control it through a driver).
Drivers can use APM function calls to notify the BIOS about CPU usage, but it is up to the BIOS to act on this information; a driver cannot directly tell the CPU to go into a power saving state.
Anarchism  Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self-governed voluntary institutions, but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations.
Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.
While anti-statism is central, anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.
As an anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy.
Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.
There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.
Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.
Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.
Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.
Etymology and terminology.
The term "anarchism" is a compound word composed from the word "anarchy" and the suffix "-ism", themselves derived respectively from the Greek ἀναρχία, i.e. "anarchy" (from ἄναρχος, "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the privative prefix ἀν("an-", i.e. "without") and ἀρχός, "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf.
"archon" or ἀρχή, "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix -ισμός or -ισμα ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal infinitive suffix -ίζειν, "-izein").
The first known use of this word was in 1539.
Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as  <START:person> Robespierre <END>  did the Hébertists) although few shared many views of later anarchists.
There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  and  <START:person> Wilhelm Weitling <END> , but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.
The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END> , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century.
Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.
On the other hand, some use "libertarianism" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "libertarian anarchism".
History.
Origins.
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of Taoist philosopher  <START:person> Laozi <END> , and in later centuries by  <START:person> Zhuangzi <END>  and  <START:person> Bao Jingyan <END> .
 <START:person> Zhuangzi <END> 's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist.
 <START:person> Zhuangzi <END>  wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail.
A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation."
 <START:person> Diogenes <END>  of Sinope and the Cynics, their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics.
 <START:person> Jesus <END>  is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition.
 <START:person> Georges Lechartier <END>  wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles."
In early Islamic history, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate, where the  <START:person> Kharijites <END>  insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.
Later, some Muslim scholars, such as  <START:person> Amer al-Basri <END>  and  <START:person> Abu Hanifa <END> , led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the waqf (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs.
But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible.
This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry.
The French renaissance political philosopher  <START:person> Étienne de La Boétie <END>  wrote in his most famous work the "Discourse on Voluntary Servitude" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.
The radical Protestant Christian  <START:person> Gerrard Winstanley <END>  and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.
The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the English Civil War, as a term of abuse, used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents.
By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the "Enragés", began to use the term positively, in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as oxymoronic.
By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly  <START:person> Jean-Jacques Rousseau <END> 's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution,  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  was, according to  <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END> , "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while  <START:person> Godwin <END>  attached his anarchist ideas to an early  <START:person> Edmund Burke <END> .
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'.
He argued in "Political Justice" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance.
He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force.
Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power.
Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.
His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage.
He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation.
In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.
The French  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END>  is regarded as the first "self-proclaimed" anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, "What is Property?,"
published in 1840.
It is for this reason that some claim  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  as the founder of modern anarchist theory.
He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order."
In "What is Property?"
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  answers with the famous accusation "Property is theft."
In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish.
He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use.
Later, however,  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  added that "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.
His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.
The anarcho-communist  <START:person> Joseph Déjacque <END>  was the first person to describe himself as "libertarian".
Unlike  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END> , he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature."
In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher  <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  published the book, "The Ego and Its Own," which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism.
French anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included  <START:person> Anselme Bellegarrigue <END> ,  <START:person> Ernest Coeurderoy <END> ,  <START:person> Joseph Déjacque <END>  and  <START:person> Pierre Joseph Proudhon <END> .
First International and the Paris Commune.
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.
After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.
In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal "El Porvenir" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by  <START:person> Proudhon <END> ´s ideas.
The Catalan politician  <START:person> Francesc Pi i Margall <END>  became the principal translator of  <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party.
According to  <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's."
According to the "Encyclopedia Britannica" "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y  <START:person> Margall <END>  attempted to establish a decentralized, or "cantonalist," political system on Proudhonian lines."
In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of  <START:person> Proudhon <END> , Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats.
Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation.
 <START:person> Karl Marx <END>  became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's followers, the mutualists, opposed  <START:person> Marx <END> 's state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.
 <START:person> Woodcock <END>  also reports that the American individualist anarchists  <START:person> Lysander Spooner <END>  and  <START:person> William B. Greene <END>  had been members of the First International.
In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary  <START:person> Mikhail Bakunin <END>  and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).
They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.
At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction.
Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with  <START:person> Marx <END>  and  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  as their respective figureheads.
 <START:person> Bakunin <END>  characterised  <START:person> Marx <END> 's ideas as centralist and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against.
Anarchist historian  <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London.
One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's Swiss supporters.
Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously.
Most of them were clearly directed against  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  and his followers."
In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where  <START:person> Bakunin <END>  and  <START:person> James Guillaume <END>  were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York.
In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.
The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871.
The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War.
Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune.
They included  <START:person> Louise Michel <END> , the Reclus brothers, and  <START:person> Eugene Varlin <END>  (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards).
As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised ...
Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  on French radical ideas.
Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's and  <START:person> Proudhon <END> 's ideas ( <START:person> Proudhon <END> , like  <START:person> Bakunin <END> , had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 ... and for federation of communes).
Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.
 <START:person> George Woodcock <END>  states: a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organisation of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists  <START:person> Courbet <END> ,  <START:person> Longuet <END> , and  <START:person> Vermorel <END> , the libertarian collectivists Varlin,  <START:person> Malon <END> , and  <START:person> Lefrangais <END> , and the bakuninists  <START:person> Elie <END>  and  <START:person> Elisée Reclus <END>  and  <START:person> Louise Michel <END> .
Organised labour.
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organisation of labour."
In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.
In response, unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event.
On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.
The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.
A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.
In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.
Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.
Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer.
The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement.
Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution.
The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day.
In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made.
The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.
Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.
In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including  <START:person> Errico Malatesta <END> ,  <START:person> Pierre Monatte <END> ,  <START:person> Luigi Fabbri <END> ,  <START:person> Benoît Broutchoux <END> ,  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> ,  <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END> , and  <START:person> Christiaan Cornelissen <END> .
Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism.
A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism).
 <START:person> Malatesta <END>  and  <START:person> Monatte <END>  were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while  <START:person> Malatesta <END>  did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.
He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials.
 <START:person> Malatesta <END>  warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain.
The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.
Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War.
The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America.
In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation.
The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions."
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism.
Some anarchists, such as  <START:person> Johann Most <END> , advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda."
By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, regicides, and tyrannicides.
From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal 'expropriations'."
Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society.
Moreover, they were clearly meant to be "exemplary" invitations to revolt.".
France's  <START:person> Bonnot Gang <END>  was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts.
 <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END>  thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite".
A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement.
The anarcho-syndicalist,  <START:person> Fernand Pelloutier <END> , argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."
State repression (including the infamous 1894 French "lois scélérates") of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts.
The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many "communards" to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including  <START:person> Tsar Alexander II <END>  of Russia, President  <START:person> Sadi Carnot <END>  of France, Empress  <START:person> Elisabeth <END>  of Austria, King Umberto I of Italy, President  <START:person> William McKinley <END>  of the United States, King  <START:person> Carlos <END>  I of Portugal and King  <START:person> George <END>  I of Greece.
 <START:person> McKinley <END> 's assassin  <START:person> Leon Czolgosz <END>  claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> .
Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the 1917 October Revolution.
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s.
Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.
However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, which the new government repressed.
Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine.
There, in the Free Territory, they fought in the civil war against the Whites (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END> , who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
Expelled American anarchists  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END>  and  <START:person> Alexander Berkman <END>  were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia.
Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised.
For them,  <START:person> Bakunin <END> 's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally.
Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.
In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International.
The revolutionary wave of 1917–23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism.
In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists  <START:person> Gustav Landauer <END> ,  <START:person> Silvio Gesell <END>  and  <START:person> Erich Mühsam <END>  had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures.
In the Italian events known as the "biennio rosso" the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "Umanita Nova", its daily paper) grew accordingly ... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces.
In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist  <START:person> Ricardo Flores Magón <END> .
In Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END> , concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.
Their 1926 manifesto, called the "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)", was supported.
Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America.
Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.
In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents  <START:person> Volin <END>  and  <START:person> Sebastien Faure <END> .
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Conflicts with European fascist regimes.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state.
Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists.
Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation "Arditi del Popolo", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922.
The veteran Italian anarchist,  <START:person> Luigi Fabbri <END> , was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution."
In France, where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy.
Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II.
In Germany the anarchist  <START:person> Erich Mühsam <END>  was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin.
 <START:person> Joseph Goebbels <END> , the Nazi propaganda minister, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives."
Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg, Brandenburg and finally, Oranienburg.
On 2 February 1934,  <START:person> Mühsam <END>  was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934,  <START:person> Mühsam <END>  was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
Spanish Revolution.
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory.
But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power.
Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).
In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land.
But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union.
The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante.
Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment.
Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes.
Anarchist historian  <START:person> Sam Dolgoff <END>  estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists.
The prominent Italian anarchist  <START:person> Camillo Berneri <END> , who volunteered to fight against  <START:person> Franco <END>  was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party.
Post-war years.
Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France.
The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District.
In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association).
From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.
In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist  <START:person> Federazione Anarchica Italiana <END>  was founded in Italy.
Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded.
An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948.
After World War II, an appeal in the "Fraye Arbeter Shtime" detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them.
By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation.
The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and  <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END>  wrote for its organ, "Die Freie Gesellschaft", which survived until 1953.
In 1956 the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded.
In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation.
The Syndicalist Workers' Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of Solidarity Federation's earliest predecessors.
It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain.
Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as  <START:person> Albert Camus <END> ,  <START:person> Herbert Read <END> ,  <START:person> Paul Goodman <END> ,  <START:person> Dwight Macdonald <END> ,  <START:person> Allen Ginsberg <END> ,  <START:person> George Woodcock <END> ,  <START:person> Leopold Kohr <END> ,  <START:person> Julian Beck <END> ,  <START:person> John Cage <END>  and the French Surrealist group led by  <START:person> André Breton <END> , which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.
Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists  <START:person> Ammon Hennacy <END>  and  <START:person> Dorothy Day <END> .
Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War."
The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in  <START:person> Robert Graham <END> 's , "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".
Contemporary anarchism.
A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s.
Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts.
In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the Fédération Anarchiste), the  <START:person> Federazione Anarchica Italiana <END>  of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.
In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols.
The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain.
In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.
Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged.
Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s.
Anarchist anthropologist  <START:person> David Graeber <END>  and anarchist historian  <START:person> Andrej Grubacic <END>  have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous, feminist, ecological and cultural-critical ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.
Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.
Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight, and the World Economic Forum.
Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police.
These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as "black blocs"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.
A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999.
According to anarchist scholar  <START:person> Simon Critchley <END> , "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism ...
One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."
International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity.
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT.
CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.
Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation; the CNT-AIT in France; the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy; in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation.
The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World, claiming 2,000 paying members, and the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.
Anarchist schools of thought.
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist anarchism and social anarchism, which have some different origins, values and evolution.
The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty, i.e. opposition to state or social control over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, "recognizing equality of entitlement".
In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.
A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.
One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "anarchism without adjectives", a call for toleration first adopted by  <START:person> Fernando Tarrida del Mármol <END>  in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time.
In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e.
collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
Classical anarchist schools of thought.
Mutualism.
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with  <START:person> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon <END>  in France and others in the United States.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order."
It is important to recognize that  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance.
For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance,  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform.
According to the American mutualist  <START:person> William Batchelder Greene <END> , each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount."
Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.
 <START:person> Proudhon <END>  first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."
Individualist anarchism.
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.
Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.
In 1793,  <START:person> William Godwin <END> , who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote "Political Justice", which some consider the first expression of anarchism.
 <START:person> Godwin <END> , a philosophical anarchist, from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.
An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German  <START:person> Max Stirner <END> .
 <START:person> Stirner <END> 's "The Ego and Its Own", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.
According to  <START:person> Stirner <END> , the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality.
To Stirner, rights were "spooks" in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality".
 <START:person> Stirner <END>  advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which  <START:person> Stirner <END>  proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state.
Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.
"Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of  <START:person> Stirner <END> 's philosophy.
It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist  <START:person> John Henry Mackay <END> .
 <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical published.
For American anarchist historian  <START:person> Eunice Minette Schuster <END>  "It is apparent ... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  and  <START:person> Stephen Pearl Andrews <END>  ...  <START:person> William B. Greene <END>  presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.".  <START:person> Henry David Thoreau <END>  (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe.
 <START:person> Thoreau <END>  was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist.
He is best known for his books "Walden", a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, "Civil Disobedience", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.
Later  <START:person> Benjamin Tucker <END>  fused  <START:person> Stirner <END> 's egoism with the economics of  <START:person> Warren <END>  and  <START:person> Proudhon <END>  in his eclectic influential publication "Liberty".
From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, free love and birth control advocates (see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex), individualist naturists nudists (see anarcho-naturism), freethought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation (see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France).
These authors and activists included  <START:person> Oscar Wilde <END> ,  <START:person> Emile Armand <END> ,  <START:person> Han Ryner <END> ,  <START:person> Henri Zisly <END> ,  <START:person> Renzo Novatore <END> ,  <START:person> Miguel Gimenez Igualada <END> ,  <START:person> Adolf Brand <END>  and  <START:person> Lev Chernyi <END>  among others.
Social anarchism.
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or coercion.
It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.
Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for personal property), and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid.
Collectivist anarchism.
Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with  <START:person> Mikhail Bakunin <END>  and  <START:person> Johann Most <END> .
Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised.
This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "propaganda by the deed", which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.
However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism.
This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system".
Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.
Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
Anarcho-communism.
Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, markets, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".
Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.
Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.
Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International.
The theoretical work of  <START:person> Peter Kropotkin <END>  took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections.
To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution.
Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war,  <START:person> Hitler <END> ,  <START:person> Mussolini <END> , Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself.
During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as  <START:person> Nestor Makhno <END>  worked to create and defend – through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine – anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.
Anarcho-syndicalism. Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement.
Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.
The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' solidarity, Direct action and Workers' self-management Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.
Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing.
They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.
 <START:person> Rudolf Rocker <END>  was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.
He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-Syndicalism".
The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries.
The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement.
It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.
Post-classical schools of thought.
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.
Green anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism, and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology.
Anarcha-feminism (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism.
It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association.
Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state.
In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa.
 <START:person> L. Susan Brown <END>  claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".
Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END>  and  <START:person> Voltairine de Cleyre <END> .
Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see non-violence).
It developed "mostly in the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War".
Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity.
Its main proponents included  <START:person> Leo Tolstoy <END> ,  <START:person> Dorothy Day <END> ,  <START:person> Ammon Hennacy <END> , and  <START:person> Jacques Ellul <END> .
Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of  <START:person> Dielo Truda <END> 's "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)".
The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups.
The "Platform" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.
Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.
In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists Voline and  <START:person> Sébastien Faure <END> .
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional Left-wing politics.
Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality.
Influenced by the work of  <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  and by the Marxist Situationist International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice.
It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses.
Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation.
Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.
Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism, autonomist marxism, post-left anarchy, Situationist International, and postcolonialism.
Left-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.
Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market.
Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics, study of law and economics, and public choice theory.
There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.
Internal issues and debates.
Anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common.
The compatibility of capitalism, nationalism, and religion with anarchism is widely disputed.
Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism, communism and capitalism.
Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.
Phenomena such as civilization, technology (e.g.
within anarcho-primitivism and insurrectionary anarchism), and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.
On a tactical level, while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the Nihilist movement), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence, counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society.
About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.
The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory.
Topics of interest.
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
Free love.
An important current within anarchism is free love.
Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty.
Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.
The most important American free love journal was "Lucifer the Lightbearer" (1883–1907) edited by  <START:person> Moses Harman <END>  and  <START:person> Lois Waisbrooker <END> , but also there existed  <START:person> Ezra Heywood <END>  and  <START:person> Angela Heywood <END> 's "The Word" (1872–1890, 1892–1893).
"Free Society" (1895–1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897–1904 as "Free Society") was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.
The publication advocated free love and women's rights, and critiqued "Comstockery" – censorship of sexual information.
Also  <START:person> M. E. Lazarus <END>  was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.
In New York City's Greenwich Village, bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now.
They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical  <START:person> Edna St. Vincent Millay <END>  and the lesbian anarchist  <START:person> Margaret Anderson <END>  were prominent among them.
Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by  <START:person> Emma Goldman <END> , among others.
 <START:person> Magnus Hirschfeld <END>  noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights.
Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public."
In fact, before Goldman, heterosexual anarchist  <START:person> Robert Reitzel <END>  (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal "Der arme  <START:person> Teufel <END> ".
In Argentina anarcha-feminist  <START:person> Virginia Bolten <END>  published the newspaper called "La Voz de la Mujer" (English: The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in  <START:person> Rosario <END>  between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.
In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was  <START:person> Emile Armand <END> .
He proposed the concept of "la camaraderie amoureuse" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults.
He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory.
In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and  <START:person> John Henry Mackay <END>  were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.
 <START:person> Mujeres Libres <END>  was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women.
It was founded in 1936 by  <START:person> Lucía Sánchez Saornil <END> , Mercedes Comaposada and  <START:person> Amparo Poch <END>  y Gascón and had approximately 30,000 members.
The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for women's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel.
In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.
 <START:person> Lucía Sánchez Saornil <END>  was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation  <START:person> Mujeres Libres <END>  who was open about her lesbianism.
She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment.
More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual "The Joy of Sex".
The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-hedonist philosopher  <START:person> Michel Onfray <END>  in such works as "Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire" (2000) and "L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques" (2002).
Libertarian education and freethought.
For English anarchist  <START:person> William Godwin <END>  education was "the main means by which change would be achieved."
 <START:person> Godwin <END>  saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.
For  <START:person> Godwin <END>  education had to have "A respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion," "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives," and "A concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school."
In his "Political Justice" he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government".
Early American anarchist  <START:person> Josiah Warren <END>  advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established.
 <START:person> Max Stirner <END>  wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called "The False Principle of our Education".
In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation.
Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".
In the United States "freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters.
A number of contributors to "Liberty" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism.
The individualist anarchist  <START:person> George MacDonald <END>  was a co-editor of "Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker".
 <START:person> E.C. Walker <END>  was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer"".
"Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer", "Freethought" and "The Truth Seeker" appeared in "Liberty"...
The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".
In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker  <START:person> Francesc Ferrer <END>  i Guàrdia established "modern" or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.
The schools' stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting".
Fiercely anti-clerical,  <START:person> Ferrer <END>  believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.
 <START:person> Murray Bookchin <END>  wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence.
Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was  <START:person> Francisco Ferrer <END> 's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally."
 <START:person> La Escuela Moderna <END> , and  <START:person> Ferrer <END> 's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of "Modern Schools" in the United States, Cuba, South America and London.
The first of these was started in New York City in 1911.
It also inspired the Italian newspaper "Università popolare", founded in 1901.
Russian christian anarchist  <START:person> Leo Tolstoy <END>  established a school for peasant children on his estate.
 <START:person> Tolstoy <END> 's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.
 <START:person> Tolstoy <END>  established a conceptual difference between education and culture.
He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free.
[Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".
For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".
A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches.
Experiments in Germany led to  <START:person> A. S. Neill <END>  founding what became Summerhill School in 1921.
Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.
However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of  <START:person> Ferrer <END>  by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se.
The term deschooling was popularised by  <START:person> Ivan Illich <END> , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms.
Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics.
European history professor  <START:person> Carl Landauer <END> , in his book "European Socialism" argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force."
He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity."
Acid  An acid (from the Latin "acidus/acēre" meaning "sour") is a chemical substance whose aqueous solutions are characterized by a sour taste, the ability to turn blue litmus red, and the ability to react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. Aqueous solutions of acids have a pH of less than 7. Non-aqueous acids are usually formed when an anion reacts with one or more positively charged hydrogen cations.
A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution.
Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic.
There are three common definitions for acids: the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition, and the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  definition.
The  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+), or more accurately, hydronium ions (H3O+), when dissolved in water.
The Brønsted-Lowry definition is an expansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor.
By this definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid.
Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or N-H fragments.
A  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid is a substance that can accept a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond.
Examples of  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids include all metal cations, and electron-deficient molecules such as boron trifluoride and aluminium trichloride.
Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and tartaric acid (a solid used in baking).
As these examples show, acids can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from solids, liquids, or gases.
Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.
Definitions and concepts.
Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.
Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions, or can be dissolved in water, so the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant.
The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified, acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H+) from an acid to a base.
Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions.
Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as  <START:person> Lewis <END>  bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
 <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acids.
The Swedish chemist  <START:person> Svante Arrhenius <END>  attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions (H+) or protons in 1884.
An  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water.
Note that chemists often write H+("aq") and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a proton, does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H3O+.
Thus, an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water.
This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and hydroxide (OH−) ions: In pure water the majority of molecules are H2O, but the molecules are constantly dissociating and re-associating, and at any time a small number of the molecules are hydronium and an equal number are hydroxide.
Because the numbers are equal, pure water is neutral (not acidic or basic).
An  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  base, on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water, hence decreasing the concentration of hydronium.
The constant association and disassociation of H2O molecules forms an equilibrium in which any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide, thus an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, with an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  base increasing it.
In an acid, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10−7 moles per liter.
Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have a pH of less than 7. Brønsted-Lowry acids.
While the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope.
In 1923 chemists  <START:person> Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Martin Lowry <END>  independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton.
A Brønsted-Lowry acid (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base.
Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  theory.
Consider the following reactions of acetic acid (CH3COOH), the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste: Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CH3COOH acts as an  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acid because it acts as a source of H3O+ when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water.
In the second example CH3COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH3), but cannot be described using the  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium.
Brønsted-Lowry theory can also be used to describe molecular compounds, whereas  <START:person> Arrhenius <END>  acids must be ionic compounds.
Hydrogen chloride (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride, NH4Cl.
In aqueous solution HCl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions.
The following reactions illustrate the limitations of  <START:person> Arrhenius <END> 's definition: As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute.
The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions.
In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in benzene) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH3 combine to form the solid.
 <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids.
A third concept was proposed in 1923 by  <START:person> Gilbert N. Lewis <END>  which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer.
A  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.
Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers.
All Brønsted acids are also  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids, but not all  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acids are Brønsted acids.
Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry.
In the first reaction a fluoride ion, F−, gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate.
Fluoride "loses" a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion.
BF3 is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride.
This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer.
The second reaction can be described using either theory.
A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a  <START:person> Lewis <END>  base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion.
The species that gains the electron pair is the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H3O+ gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen.
Depending on the context, a  <START:person> Lewis <END>  acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile.
Dissociation and equilibrium.
Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA H+ + A−, where HA represents the acid and A− is the conjugate base.
Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton (protonation and deprotonation, respectively).
Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA+ H+ + A. In solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base.
The equilibrium constant "K" is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution.
Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H2O] means "the concentration of H2O".
The acid dissociation constant "K"a is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions.
The numerical value of "K"a is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H+.
The stronger of two acids will have a higher "K"a than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton.
Because the range of possible values for "K"a spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p"K"a is more frequently used, where p"K"a = -log10 "K"a.
Stronger acids have a smaller p"K"a than weaker acids.
Experimentally determined p"K"a at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.
Nomenclature.
In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their anions.
That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.
For example, HCl has chloride as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid.
In the IUPAC naming system, "aqueous" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound.
Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride.
The prefix "hydro-" is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.
Classical naming system: Acid strength.
The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton.
A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA.
In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution.
Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%.
The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+.
Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond.
Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.
Stronger acids have a larger "K"a and a more negative p"K"a than weaker acids.
Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids.
A common example is toluenesulfonic acid (tosylic acid).
Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids.
In fact, polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.
Superacids are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid.
Examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid, magic acid and perchloric acid.
Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline hydronium "salts".
They can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations.
While "K"a measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.
The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's "K"a.
Chemical characteristics.
Monoprotic acids.
Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA): Common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO3).
On the other hand, for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid.
Examples in organic acids include formic acid (HCOOH), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and benzoic acid (C6H5COOH).
Polyprotic acids.
Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule.
Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).
A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H2A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH.
Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, Ka1 and Ka2.
The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., "K"a1 > "K"a2.
For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion (HSO4−), for which "K"a1 is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion (SO42−), wherein the "K"a2 is intermediate strength.
The large "K"a1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid.
In a similar manner, the weak unstable carbonic acid (H2CO3) can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) and lose a second to form carbonate anion (CO32−).
Both "K"a values are small, but "K"a1 > "K"a2 .
A triprotic acid (H3A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where "K"a1 > "K"a2 > "K"a3.
An inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4), usually just called phosphoric acid.
All three protons can be successively lost to yield H2PO4−, then HPO42−, and finally PO43−, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called phosphate.
Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive "K"a values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged.
An organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid, which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion.
Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution.
The fractional concentration, "α" (alpha), for each species can be calculated.
For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H2A, HA−, and A2−.
The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H+]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases: A plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given "K"1 and "K"2, is known as a Bjerrum plot.
A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general "n" -protic acid that has been deprotonated "i" -times: where K0 = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.
Neutralization.
Neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a salt and neutralized base; for example, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water: Neutralization is the basis of titration, where a pH indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid.
It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.
Neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt.
An example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride, which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia.
Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g.
sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide.
Weak acid–weak base equilibrium.
In order for a protonated acid to lose a proton, the pH of the system must rise above the p"K"a of the acid.
The decreased concentration of H+ in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid).
In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H+ concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form.
Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions.
Applications of acids.
There are numerous uses for acids.
Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling.
They may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery, such as sulfuric acid in a car battery.
Strong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing.
For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.
In the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts.
For example, nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer.
Additionally, carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols, to produce esters.
Acids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives.
Phosphoric acid, for example, is a component of cola drinks.
Acetic acid is used in day-to-day life as vinegar.
Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.
Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.
Tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind.
Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids.
Citric acid is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits.
Oxalic acid is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in carambola and rhubarb; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.
Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla (Indian gooseberry), lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.
Certain acids are used as drugs.
Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.
Acids play important roles in the human body.
The hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules.
Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues.
Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues.
Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA and RNA and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes.
Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.
Acid catalysis.
Acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline.
Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions.
In biochemistry, many enzymes employ acid catalysis.
Biological occurrence.
Many biologically important molecules are acids.
Nucleic acids, which contain acidic phosphate groups, include DNA and RNA.
Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring.
DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits.
Cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids.
An α-amino acid has a central carbon (the α or "alpha" carbon) which is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group (thus they are carboxylic acids), an amino group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group.
The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid.
In glycine, the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen.
With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the .
Peptidoglycan, found in some bacterial cell walls contains some -amino acids.
At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO−) and the basic amine group (-NH2) gains a proton (-NH3+).
The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion, with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains.
Aspartic acid, for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of −1 at physiological pH.
Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology.
These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end.
The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer, a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic phosphate "head" groups.
Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.
In humans and many other animals, hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, pepsinogen into the enzyme, pepsin.
Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce formic acid.
Acid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing.
Oxygen gas (O2) drives cellular respiration, the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food, producing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs, and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation.
For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat, releasing CO2 into the blood stream.
In aqueous solutions such as blood CO2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion.
It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO2 and resupplying the cells with O2.  Cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior.
Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base).
For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods.
The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and cytosol, both aqueous environments.
When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer.
Acids that lose a proton at the intracellular pH will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target.
Ibuprofen, aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids.
Common acids.
Sulfonic acids.
A sulfonic acid has the general formula RS(=O)2–OH, where R is an organic radical.
Carboxylic acids.
A carboxylic acid has the general formula R-C(O)OH, where R is an organic radical.
The carboxyl group -C(O)OH contains a carbonyl group, C=O, and a hydroxyl group, O-H.
Halogenated carboxylic acids.
Halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength, so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid.
Vinylogous carboxylic acids.
Normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group.
In vinylogous carboxylic acids, a carbon-carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.
Adventure  An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.
It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.
Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.
The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.
Motivation.
Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g.
fear) or positive (e.g.
flow), and which can be detrimental as stated by the Yerkes-Dodson law.
For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself.
According to adventurer  <START:person> André Malraux <END> , in his "La Condition Humaine" (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".
Similarly,  <START:person> Helen Keller <END>  stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."
Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism.
Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer  <START:person> Jason Lewis <END> , for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren.
Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.
Adventure in mythology.
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's "The Odyssey".
Mythologist  <START:person> Joseph Campbell <END>  discussed his notion of the monomyth in his book, "The Hero with a Thousand Faces".
 <START:person> Campbell <END>  proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.
The knight errant was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.
The adventure novel exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as "Star Wars" and "The Raiders of the Lost Ark".
Articles of Confederation  The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was a document signed amongst the thirteen original colonies that established the United States of America as a confederation of sovereign states and served as its first constitution.
Its drafting by a committee appointed by the Second Continental Congress began on July 12, 1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for ratification in late 1777.
The formal ratification by all thirteen states was completed in early 1781.
Even when not yet ratified, the Articles provided domestic and international legitimacy for the Continental Congress to direct the American Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with Europe and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations.
Nevertheless, the weakness of the government created by the Articles became a matter of concern for key nationalists.
On March 4, 1789, the general government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the United States Constitution.
The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government with a chief executive (the president), courts, and taxing powers.
Background and context.
The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and  <START:person> Benjamin Franklin <END> 's proposed Albany Plan of Union, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems.
The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it.
Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown.
With civil disobedience resulting in coercive and intolerable acts, and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it.
In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government to run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence.
It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not.
During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority.
It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.
To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it.
In early 1776,  <START:person> Thomas Paine <END>  argued in the closing pages of the first edition of "Common Sense" that the “custom of nations” demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain.
The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch.
Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a “manifesto” which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners.
Without such a declaration,  <START:person> Paine <END>  concluded, “[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.”
Beyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations.
On June 7, 1776,  <START:person> Richard Henry Lee <END>  introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve “to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances” and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states.
Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation.
The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established “a firm league” among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.
Drafting.
On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.
The committee met repeatedly, and chairman  <START:person> John Dickinson <END>  presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776.
There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures.
The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.
In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777; the final draft of the Articles served as the de facto system of government used by the Congress ("the United States in Congress assembled") until it became de jure by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the Congress of the Confederation.
Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government.
The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government.
It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories.
Article XIII stipulated that "their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state" and "the Union shall be perpetual".
 <START:person> John Dickinson <END> 's and  <START:person> Benjamin Franklin <END> 's handwritten drafts of the Articles of Confederation are housed at the National Archives in Washington, DC.
Operation.
The Articles were created by delegates from the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a need to have "a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States."
After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government.
There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base.
The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.
In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the United States Constitution and the new government began operations in 1789.
Ratification.
Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777: "Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states.
Let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties..." The document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all 13 states.
The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777; the thirteenth state to ratify was Maryland on February 2, 1781.
A ceremonial confirmation of this thirteenth, final ratification took place in the Congress on March 1, 1781 at high noon.
Dates of ratification are: The ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by the refusal of some states to rescind their claims to land in the West.
Maryland was the last holdout; it refused to go along until Virginia and New York agreed to cede their claims in the Ohio River Valley.
It took a little over three years for all states to ratify.
The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of Province of Quebec (referred to as "Canada" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so.
It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission.
Article summaries.
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people, the two documents are very different.
Stylistically, the Articles are more wordy, less straightforward and less quotable than the Constitution.
Functionally, they lay out very different forms of government.
The original five-page Articles contained a preamble, 13 articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.
The preamble states that the signatory states "agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union" between the 13 states.
The following list contains short summaries of each of the 13 articles.
While still at war with Britain, the Founding Fathers were divided between those seeking a powerful, centralized national government (the "federalists"), and those seeking a loosely structured one (the "anti federalists").
Jealously guarding their new independence, members of the Continental Congress arrived at a compromise solution dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states.
While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism with which to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or revenue.
At times, this left the military without adequate funding, supplies or even food.
The end of the Revolutionary War.
The Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it.
Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance.
In September 1783,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  complained that Congress was paralyzed.
Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.
Function.
The Army.
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the Continental Army, and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers.
As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian  <START:person> Bruce Chadwick <END>  wrote:  <START:person> George Washington <END>  had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government.
The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress.
... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states.
Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.
The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life.
However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor.
No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783–84.
General  <START:person> Henry Knox <END> , who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army.
The army had long been supportive of a strong union.
 <START:person> Knox <END>  wrote: The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies.
Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign.
... It is a favorite toast in the army, "A hoop to the barrel" or "Cement to the Union".
As Congress failed to act on the petitions,  <START:person> Knox <END>  wrote to  <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END> , four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, "As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution."
Once the war had been won, the Continental Army was largely disbanded.
A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks.
Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies.
The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met.
In 1783,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  defused the Newburgh conspiracy, but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.
The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states.
Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests.
The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs.
 <START:person> Dougherty <END>  (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis.
This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.
Foreign policy.
Even after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy.
In 1789,  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> , concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates, wrote to  <START:person> James Monroe <END> , "It will be said there is no money in the treasury.
There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth.
The states must see the rod.”
Furthermore, the  <START:person> Jay <END> –Gardoqui Treaty with Spain in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy.
In this treaty — which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity — the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains.
Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil — forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation.
This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris (1783) was superseded by the implementation of  <START:person> Jay <END> 's Treaty in 1795 under the new U.S. Constitution.
Taxation and Commerce.
Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited.
The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers.
Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.
Congress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states.
The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money.
As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated.
In 1779,  <START:person> George Washington <END>  wrote to  <START:person> John Jay <END> , who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, "that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions."
Mr.  <START:person> Jay <END>  and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the States.
In an appeal to the States to comply,  <START:person> Jay <END>  wrote that the taxes were "the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity."
He argued that Americans should avoid having it said "that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent" or that "her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith."
The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.
Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies.
The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War.
Some States paid off their war debts and others did not.
Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.
Accomplishments of the Confederation.
Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact.
The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states, the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use.
This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.
The Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River.
Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the township (36 square miles), the section (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 acres).
This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire).
Then, when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims, organized the Northwest Territory and thus cleared the way for the entry of five new states and part of a sixth to the Union.
To be specific, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia gave up all of their claims to land north of the Ohio River and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania.
Over several decades a number of new states were formed from this land: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River.
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery.
New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.
The United States of America under the Articles.
The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure.
The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced.
There was no president and no national court.
Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.
By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity.
However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires.
The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships.
France and Spain established similar policies.
Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again.
Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution.
The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation.
In 1786–87,  <START:person> Shays <END> ' Rebellion, an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.
The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression "not worth a continental".
Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States.
Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.
When  <START:person> John Adams <END>  went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce.
Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty.
 <START:person> Adams <END>  stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain.
Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws.
Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect.
When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.
By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping.
State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit.
Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.
The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor.
 <START:person> Alexander Hamilton <END>  realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress.
 <START:person> Hamilton <END>  led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.
Signatures.
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777.
A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress.
On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of  <START:person> Henry Laurens <END>  and  <START:person> Charles Thomson <END> , who were the President and Secretary to the Congress.
The "Articles", however, were unsigned, and the date was blank.
Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the "Articles" on June 27, 1778.
They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.
On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready.
They dated it, and began to sign.
They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed.
On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified.
New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified.
North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.
After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended.
For example,  <START:person> John Wentworth <END>  of New Hampshire added his name on August 8.
 <START:person> John Penn <END>  was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the "Articles" on July 21, 1778.
The other states had to wait until they ratified the "Articles" and notified their Congressional delegation.
Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779.
Maryland refused to ratify the "Articles" until every state had ceded its western land claims.
On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis.
As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, "among engrossed Bills" was "signed and sealed by Governor  <START:person> Thomas Sim Lee <END>  in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation" and perpetual union among the states.
The Senate then adjourned "to the first Monday in August next."
The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12.
The confirmation signing of the "Articles" by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon.
With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.
Congress had debated the "Articles" for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years.
Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived.
The "Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union" were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.
Signers.
The signers and the states they represented were:  <START:person> Roger Sherman <END>  (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
 <START:person> Robert Morris <END>  (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
 <START:person> John Dickinson <END>  (Delaware),  <START:person> Daniel Carroll <END>  (Maryland) and  <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END>  (New York), along with  <START:person> Sherman <END>  and  <START:person> Robert Morris <END> , were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution ( <START:person> Gouverneur Morris <END>  represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).
Presidents of the Congress.
The following list is of those who led the Congress of the Confederation under the "Articles of Confederation" as the Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled.
Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions.
He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor President of the United States is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.
"For a full list of Presidents of the Congress Assembled and Presidents under the two Continental Congresses before the Articles, see President of the Continental Congress."
Revision and replacement.
On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following  <START:person> James Madison <END> 's recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict.
At what came to be known as the Annapolis Convention, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a "Grand Convention."
Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution.
The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed.
The general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships.
Historian  <START:person> Forrest McDonald <END> , using the ideas of  <START:person> James Madison <END>  from "Federalist 39", describes the change this way: The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun.
Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states.
The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.
In May 1786,  <START:person> Charles Pinckney <END>  of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation.
Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries.
Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus.
The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after  <START:person> Shays <END> ' Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.
Historian  <START:person> Ralph Ketcham <END>  comments on the opinions of  <START:person> Patrick Henry <END> ,  <START:person> George Mason <END> , and other antifederalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution: Antifederalists feared what  <START:person> Patrick Henry <END>  termed the "consolidated government" proposed by the new Constitution.
They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a "splendid empire" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns.
Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.
Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787.
 <START:person> Jillson <END>  and  <START:person> Wilson <END>  (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.
 <START:person> Rakove <END>  (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation.
The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power.
It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island.
 <START:person> Rakove <END>  concludes that their failure to implement national measures "stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace."
The second group of factors  <START:person> Rakove <END>  identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy.
Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.
When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new "merchant state," much like the British state people had rebelled against.
In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims.
Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.
Legitimacy of closing down.
Political scientist  <START:person> David C. Hendrickson <END>  writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation,  <START:person> John Jay <END>  of New York and  <START:person> Thomas Burke <END>  of North Carolina believed that "the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges."
According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously:  [T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.
On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity: The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.
The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.
In 1788,  <START:person> James Madison <END>  remarked (in "Federalist No. 40") that the issue had become moot: "As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation."
Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.
At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.
Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.
Modern scholars such as  <START:person> Francisco Forrest Martin <END>  agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus "other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule".
In contrast, law professor  <START:person> Akhil Amar <END>  suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.
Final months.
According to their terms for modification (Article XIII), the Articles would still have been in effect until 1790, the year in which the last of the 13 states, Rhode Island, ratified the new Constitution.
The Congress under the Articles continued to convene with a quorum until October 1788, overseeing the adoption of the new Constitution by the states, setting elections and attending to other business.
By July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.
On Saturday, September 13, 1788, the Confederation Congress voted the resolve to implement the new Constitution, and on Monday, September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.
On that same September 13, it determined that New York would remain the national capital.

Aikido  Aikido (Japanese: 合気道,  <START:person> Hepburn <END> : Aikidō) ] is a Japanese martial art developed by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and religious beliefs.
Aikido is often translated as "the way of unifying (with) life energy" or as "the way of harmonious spirit."
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury.
Aikido techniques consist of entering and turning movements that redirect the momentum of an opponent's attack, and a throw or joint lock that terminates the technique.
Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's involvement with the Ōmoto-kyō religion.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's early students' documents bear the term "aiki-jūjutsu".
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him.
Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis.
However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.
Etymology and basic philosophy.
The word "aikido" is formed of three kanji: The term "aiki" does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of  <START:person> Budo <END> .
This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.
合 is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being 合同 (combined/united), 合成 (composition), 結合 (unite/combine/join together), 連合 (union/alliance/association), 統合 (combine/unify), and 合意 (mutual agreement).
There is an idea of reciprocity, 知り合う (to get to know one another), 話し合い (talk/discussion/negotiation), and 待ち合わせる (meet by appointment).
気 is often used to describe a feeling, as in なになに気がする ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and 気持ち (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in 電気 (electricity) and 磁気 (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in 気質 (spirit/trait/temperament).
The term dō is also found in martial arts such as judo and kendo, and in various non-martial arts, such as Japanese calligraphy (shodō), flower arranging (kadō) and tea ceremony (chadō or sadō).
Therefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the "Way of combining forces", in that the term aiki refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.
One applies aiki by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.
History.
Aikido was created by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  (植芝 盛平 "Ueshiba Morihei", 14 December 1883 – 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as "Ōsensei" ("Great Teacher").
The term 'aikido' was coined in the twentieth century.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation.
During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the Aiki that  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.
Initial development.
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.
The core martial art from which aikido derives is Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu, which  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  studied directly with  <START:person> Takeda Sōkaku <END> , the reviver of that art.
Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied  <START:person> Tenjin Shin <END> 'yō-ryū with  <START:person> Tozawa Tokusaburō <END>  in Tokyo in 1901, Gotōha Yagyū Shingan-ryū under  <START:person> Nakai Masakatsu <END>  in Sakai from 1903 to 1908, and judo with  <START:person> Kiyoichi Takagi <END>  (高木 喜代子 "Takagi Kiyoichi", 1894–1972) in Tanabe in 1911.
The art of Daitō-ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido.
Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the spear ("yari"), short staff ("jō"), and perhaps the bayonet (銃剣, jūken).
However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ("kenjutsu").
 <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  moved to Hokkaidō in 1912, and began studying under  <START:person> Takeda Sokaku <END>  in 1915.
His official association with Daitō-ryū continued until 1937.
However, during the latter part of that period,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  had already begun to distance himself from  <START:person> Takeda <END>  and the Daitō-ryū.
At that time  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  was referring to his martial art as "Aiki Budō".
It is unclear exactly when  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  began using the name "aikido", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ("Dai Nippon Butoku Kai") was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.
Religious influences.
After  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  left  <START:person> Hokkaidō <END>  in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by  <START:person> Onisaburo Deguchi <END> , the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in  <START:person> Ayabe <END> .
One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life.
This was a great influence on  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others.
Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it.
In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.
In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with  <START:person> Deguchi <END>  gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.
As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students.
Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.
International dissemination.
Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by  <START:person> Minoru Mochizuki <END>  with a visit to France where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students.
He was followed by  <START:person> Tadashi Abe <END>  in 1952 who came as the official Aikikai Hombu representative, remaining in France for seven years.
 <START:person> Kenji Tomiki <END>  toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953.
Later in that year,  <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END>  was sent by  <START:person> Aikikai Hombu <END>  to Hawaii, for a full year, where he set up several dojo.
This was followed up by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States.
The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by  <START:person> Hiroshi Tada <END> ; and Germany 1965 by  <START:person> Katsuaki Asai <END> .
Designated "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa" by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> ,  <START:person> Masamichi Noro <END>  arrived in France in September 1961.
 <START:person> Seiichi Sugano <END>  was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965.
Today there are aikido dojo available throughout the world.
Proliferation of independent organizations.
The largest aikido organization is the Aikikai Foundation, which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family.
However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> 's major students.
The earliest independent styles to emerge were Yoseikan Aikido, begun by  <START:person> Minoru Mochizuki <END>  in 1931, Yoshinkan Aikido founded by  <START:person> Gozo Shioda <END>  in 1955, and Shodokan Aikido, founded by  <START:person> Kenji Tomiki <END>  in 1967.
The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized.
Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.
After  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged.
Significant controversy arose with the departure of the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief instructor  <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END> , in 1974.
 <START:person> Tohei <END>  left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder,  <START:person> Kisshomaru Ueshiba <END> , who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation.
The disagreement was over the proper role of "ki" development in regular aikido training.
After  <START:person> Tohei <END>  left, he formed his own style, called  <START:person> Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido <END> , and the organization which governs it, the Ki Society ("Ki no Kenkyūkai").
A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in Iwama, Ibaraki, and the teaching methodology of long term student  <START:person> Morihiro Saito <END> .
It is unofficially referred to as the "Iwama style", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called  <START:person> Iwama Ryu <END> .
Although  <START:person> Iwama <END>  style practitioners remained part of the  <START:person> Aikikai <END>  until  <START:person> Saito <END> 's death in 2002, followers of  <START:person> Saito <END>  subsequently split into two groups; one remaining with the  <START:person> Aikikai <END>  and the other forming the independent Shinshin Aikishuren Kai in 2004 around  <START:person> Saito <END> 's son  <START:person> Hitohiro Saito <END> .
Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own headquarters (本部道場, honbu dōjō) in Japan, and have an international breadth.
Ki.
The study of "ki" is a critical component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses both.
The original "kanji" for "ki" was 氣, and is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice; the "nourishing vapors" contained within are "ki".
The character for "ki" is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as "health" (元気, genki), or "shyness" (内気, uchiki).
"Ki" is most often understood as unified physical and mental intention, however in traditional martial arts it is often discussed as "life energy".
 <START:person> Gōzō Shioda <END> 's Yoshinkan Aikido, considered one of the "hard styles," largely follows  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to "ki" lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.
In later years,  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> 's application of "ki" in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel.
This was his  <START:person> Takemusu Aiki <END>  and many of his later students teach about "ki" from this perspective.
 <START:person> Koichi Tohei <END> 's Ki Society centers almost exclusively around the study of the empirical (albeit subjective) experience of "ki" with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and "ki" development.
Training.
In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training.
The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques.
Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll.
The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins.
After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.
Fitness.
Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training.
In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements.
This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.
In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power.
Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates.
For example, many dojos begin each class with warm-up exercises (準備体操, "junbi taisō"), which may include stretching and ukemi (break falls).
Roles of "uke" and "tori".
Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms ("kata") rather than freestyle practice.
The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique ("uke") to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the 取り "tori", or "shite" 仕手 (depending on aikido style), also referred to as 投げ "nage" (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.
Both halves of the technique, that of "uke" and that of "nage", are considered essential to aikido training.
Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation.
"Nage" learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while "uke" learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which "nage" places them.
This "receiving" of the technique is called "ukemi".
"Uke" continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while "nage" uses position and timing to keep "uke" off-balance and vulnerable.
In more advanced training, "uke" will sometimes apply reversal techniques (返し技, kaeshi-waza) to regain balance and pin or throw "nage".
"Ukemi" (受身) refers to the act of receiving a technique.
Good "ukemi" involves attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment—it is an active rather than a passive receiving of aikido.
The fall itself is part of aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, what would otherwise be a devastating strike or throw.
Initial attacks.
Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner.
Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.
Many of the strikes (打ち, uchi) of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for armed combat.
Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches ("tsuki"), are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword.
Kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.
Some basic strikes include: Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike.
Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.
The following are examples of some basic grabs: Basic techniques.
The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins.
Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> .
The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation.
Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.
Implementations.
Aikido makes use of body movement ("tai sabaki") to blend with "uke".
For example, an "entering" ("irimi") technique consists of movements inward towards "uke", while a "turning" (転換, tenkan) technique uses a pivoting motion.
Additionally, an "inside" (内, uchi) technique takes place in front of "uke", whereas an "outside" (外, soto) technique takes place to his side; a "front" (表, omote) technique is applied with motion to the front of "uke", and a "rear" (裏, ura) version is applied with motion towards the rear of "uke", usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion.
Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture ("seiza").
Techniques where both "uke" and "nage" are standing are called "tachi-waza", techniques where both start off in "seiza" are called "suwari-waza", and techniques performed with "uke" standing and "nage" sitting are called "hanmi handachi".
Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations.
For instance, "ikkyō" can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an "ura" type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an "omote-waza" version).
Specific aikido "kata" are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)".
For instance, "katate-dori ikkyō" refers to any "ikkyō" technique executed when "uke" is holding one wrist.
This could be further specified as "katate-dori ikkyō omote", referring to any forward-moving "ikkyō" technique from that grab.
"Atemi" (当て身) are strikes (or feints) employed during an aikido technique.
Some view "atemi" as attacks against "vital points" meant to cause damage in and of themselves.
For instance,  <START:person> Gōzō Shioda <END>  described using "atemi" in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.
Others consider "atemi", especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques.
A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration.
The target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.
Many sayings about "atemi" are attributed to  <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END> , who considered them an essential element of technique.
Weapons.
Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff ("jō"), wooden sword ("bokken"), and knife ("tantō").
Some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques.
Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught.
Some schools, such as the  <START:person> Iwama <END>  style of  <START:person> Morihiro Saito <END> , usually spend substantial time with "bokken" and "jō", practised under the names "aiki-ken", and "aiki-jō", respectively.
The founder developed much of empty-handed aikido from traditional sword and spear movements.
Consequently, the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).
Multiple attackers and "randori".
One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called "taninzudori", or "taninzugake".
Freestyle ("randori", or "jiyūwaza") practice with multiple attackers is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks.
"Randori", literally "chaos", exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.
Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in "randori" training.
For instance, an "ura" technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.
In Shodokan Aikido, "randori" differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will.
In this respect it resembles judo "randori".

In applying a technique during training, it is the responsibility of "nage" to prevent injury to "uke" by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in "ukemi".
Injuries (especially those to the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of "nage" misjudging the ability of "uke" to receive the throw or pin.
A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other.
Soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido, as well as joint strain and stubbed fingers and toes.
Several deaths from aggressive "shihōnage", resulting from head and neck injury, in a Japanese-style hazing context have been reported.
Mental training.
Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.
This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness.
 <START:person> Morihei Ueshiba <END>  once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute techniques without hesitation.
As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.
Uniforms and ranking.
Aikido practitioners (commonly called "aikidōka" outside of Japan) generally progress by promotion through a series of "grades" ("kyū"), followed by a series of "degrees" ("dan"), pursuant to formal testing procedures.
Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and black belts to distinguish lower and higher grades, though some use various belt colors.
Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.
Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a "dan" rank unless they are 16 or older.
The uniform worn for practicing aikido ("aikidōgi") is similar to the training uniform ("keikogi") used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.
Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used.
Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.
Most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called a "hakama" (used also in kendo and iaido.)
In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with ("dan") ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a "hakama" regardless of rank.
Criticisms.
The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training.
The attacks initiated by "uke" (and which "nage" must defend against) have been criticized as being "weak," "sloppy," and "little more than caricatures of an attack."
Weak attacks from "uke" allow for a conditioned response from "nage", and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.
To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners.
Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format.
Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.
Another criticism pertains to the shift toward ki as the focus of training.
After the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in  <START:person> Iwama <END>  from 1942 to the mid-1950s, he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido.
As a result, strikes to vital points by "nage", entering ("irimi") and initiation of techniques by "nage", the distinction between "omote" (front side) and "ura" (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.
Lack of training in these areas is thought to lead to an overall loss of effectiveness by some aikido practitioners.
Conversely, some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by  <START:person> Ueshiba <END> .
The premise of this criticism is that "O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts."
That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional "jujutsu" or "kenjutsu" are diverging from what  <START:person> Ueshiba <END>  taught.
Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that "[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals ["sic"] of the paradigm that he demonstrated."
Aquarius (constellation)  Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces.
Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its symbol is (Unicode ♒), a representation of water.
Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the sun's apparent path).
It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer  <START:person> Ptolemy <END> , and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.
It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish, and Eridanus the river.
History and mythology.
Aquarius is identified as GU.LA "The Great One" in the Babylonian star catalogues and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase.
The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium.
It contained the winter solstice in the Early Bronze Age.
In Old Babylonian astronomy,  <START:person> Ea <END>  was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun's path, the "Way of Ea", corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice.
Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negatively connoted.
In Ancient Egypt, Aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the Nile; the banks were said to flood when  <START:person> Aquarius <END>  put his jar into the river, beginning spring.
In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to  <START:person> Piscis Austrinus <END> .
The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise "kumbha" "water-pitcher", showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek intermediaries.
In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with  <START:person> Troy <END> .
The myth has is that a young boy named Ganymede was out tending to his fathers sheep when  <START:person> Zeus <END>  took interest in this young beautiful boy.
 <START:person> Zeus <END>  then turned himself into an eagle and carried Ganymede to Mount Ide where Ganymede would have to serve drinks to Zeus.
But one day, Ganymede didn't want to serve drinks anymore, so he poured out Zeus wine and water which caused a great flood.
It was then said instead of Zeus getting mad he gave Ganymede immortality and gave him the constellation Aquarius.
In non-Western astronomy.
In Chinese astronomy, the stream of water flowing from the Water Jar was depicted as the "Army of Yu-Lin" ("Yu-lin-kiun" or "Yulinjun").
The name "Yu-lin" means "feathers and forests", referring to the numerous light-footed soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars.
The constellation's stars were the most numerous of any Chinese constellation, numbering 45, the majority of which were located in modern Aquarius.
The celestial army was protected by the wall "Leibizhen", which counted Iota, Lambda, Phi, and Sigma Aquarii among its 12 stars.
88, 89, and 98 Aquarii represent "Fou-youe", the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions.
Also in Aquarius is "Loui-pi-tchin", the ramparts that stretch from 29 and 27 Piscium and 33 and 30 Aquarii through Phi, Lambda, Sigma, and  <START:person> Iota Aquarii <END>  to Delta, Gamma, Kappa, and Epsilon Capricorni.
Near the border with Cetus, the axe "Fuyue" was represented by three stars; its position is disputed and may have instead been located in Sculptor.
"Tienliecheng" also has a disputed position; the 13-star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed Nu and Xi Aquarii but may instead have been located south in Piscis Austrinus.
The Water Jar asterism was seen to the ancient Chinese as the tomb, "Fenmu".
Nearby, the emperors' mausoleum "Xiuliang" stood, demarcated by  <START:person> Kappa Aquarii <END>  and three other collinear stars.
"Ku" ("crying") and "Qi" ("weeping"), each composed of two stars, were located in the same region.
Three of the Chinese lunar mansions shared their name with constellations.
"Nu", also the name for the 10th lunar mansion, was a handmaiden represented by Epsilon, Mu, 3, and 4 Aquarii.
The 11th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation "Xu" ("emptiness"), formed by Beta Aquarii and Alpha Equulei; it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals.
"Wei", the rooftop and 12th lunar mansion, was a V-shaped constellation formed by Alpha Aquarii, Theta Pegasi, and Epsilon Pegasi; it shared its name with two other Chinese constellations, in modern-day Scorpius and Aries.
Depictions.
In the first century CE,  <START:person> Ptolemy <END> 's "Almagest" established the common Western depiction of Aquarius.
His water jar, an asterism itself, consists of Gamma, Pi, Eta, and Zeta Aquarii; it pours water in a stream of more than 20 stars terminating with Fomalhaut, now assigned solely to  <START:person> Piscis Austrinus <END> .
The water bearer's head is represented by 5th magnitude 25 Aquarii while his left shoulder is Beta Aquarii; his right shoulder and forearm are represented by Alpha and  <START:person> Gamma Aquarii <END>  respectively.
Notable features.
Stars.
Despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size, Aquarius has no particularly bright stars, with its 4 brightest stars less than magnitude 2. However, recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems.
α Aquarii, also known as  <START:person> Sadalmelik <END> , is a G2 spectral class star (yellow supergiant) named in Arabic for the phrase "the lucky stars of the king".
It is the second brightest star in Aquarius with a magnitude of 2.96 (though it has an absolute magnitude of -4.5) and is 523 light-years from Earth.
It has a luminosity of 5250 L☉.
β Aquarii, sometimes called Sadalsuud, is a G0 spectral class star (yellow supergiant) named for the Arabic phrase meaning "luckiest of the lucky stars".
It is the brightest star in Aquarius with an apparent magnitude of 2.91 and an absolute magnitude of -4.5.
Sadalsuud is 537 light-years from Earth and has a luminosity of 5250 L☉, the same as α Aquarii.
γ Aquarii, also called Sadachbia, is a blue-white A0 spectral class star of magnitude 3.84 and a luminosity of 50 L☉ that is 163 light years away.
It has a luminosity of 50 L☉.
The name  <START:person> Sadachbia <END>  comes from the Arabic for "lucky stars of the tents", "sa'd al-akhbiya".
δ Aquarii, also known as  <START:person> Scheat <END>  or Skat, is a blue-white A2 spectral class star of magnitude 3.27 and luminosity of 105 L☉.
ε Aquarii, also known as Albali, is a blue-white A1 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 3.77, an absolute magnitude of 1.2, and a luminosity of 28 L☉.
ζ Aquarii is an F2 spectral class double star; both stars are white.
Overall, it appears to be of magnitude 3.6 and luminosity of 50 L☉.
The primary has a magnitude of 4.53 and the secondary a magnitude of 4.31, but both have an absolute magnitude of 0.6.
Its orbital period is 760 years; the two components are currently moving farther apart.
θ Aquarii, sometimes called Ancha, is a G8 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.16 and an absolute magnitude of 1.4.
λ Aquarii, also called Hudoor or Ekchusis, is an M2 spectral class star of magnitude 3.74 and luminosity of 120 L☉.
ξ Aquarii, also called  <START:person> Bunda <END> , is an A7 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.69 and an absolute magnitude of 2.4.
π Aquarii, also called Seat, is a B0 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.66 and an absolute magnitude of -4.1.
Planetary systems.
Twelve exoplanet systems have been found in Aquarius as of 2013.
Gliese 876, one of the nearest stars to Earth at a distance of 15 light-years, was the first red dwarf star to be found to possess a planetary system.
It is orbited by four planets, including one terrestrial planet 6.6 times the mass of Earth.
The planets vary in orbital period from 2 days to 124 days.
91 Aquarii is an orange giant star orbited by one planet, 91 Aquarii b.
The planet's mass is 2.9 times the mass of Jupiter, and its orbital period is 182 days.
Gliese 849 is a red dwarf star orbited by the first known long-period Jupiter-like planet, Gliese 849 b.
The planet's mass is 0.99 times that of Jupiter and its orbital period is 1,852 days.
There are also less-prominent systems in Aquarius.
WASP-6, a type G8 star of magnitude 12.4, is host to one exoplanet, WASP-6 b.
The star is 307 parsecs from Earth and has a mass of 0.888 solar masses and a radius of 0.87 solar radii.
WASP-6 b was discovered in 2008 by the transit method.
It orbits its parent star every 3.36 days at a distance of 0.042 astronomical units (AU).
It is 0.503 Jupiter masses but has a proportionally larger radius of 1.224 Jupiter radii.
HD 206610, a K0 star located 194 parsecs from Earth, is host to one planet, HD 206610 b.
The host star is larger than the Sun; more massive at 1.56 solar masses and larger at 6.1 solar radii.
The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method n 2010 and has a mass of 2.2 Jupiter masses.
It orbits every 610 days at a distance of 1.68 AU.
Much closer to its sun is WASP-47 b, which orbits every 4.15 days only 0.052 AU from its sun, yellow dwarf (G9V) WASP-47.
WASP-47 is close in size to the Sun, having a radius of 1.15 solar radii and a mass even closer at 1.08 solar masses.
WASP-47 b was discovered in 2011 by the transit method, like WASP-6 b.
It is slightly larger than Jupiter with a mass of 1.14 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.15 Jupiter masses.
There are several more single-planet systems in Aquarius.
HD 210277, a magnitude 6.63 yellow star located 21.29 parsecs from Earth, is host to one known planet: HD 210277 b.
The 1.23 Jupiter mass planet orbits at nearly the same distance as Earth orbits the Sun 1.1 AU, though its orbital period is significantly longer at around 442 days.
HD 210277 b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in Aquarius, detected by the radial velocity method in 1998.
The star it orbits resembles the Sun beyond their similar spectral class; it has a radius of 1.1 solar radii and a mass of 1.09 solar masses.
HD 212771 b, a larger planet at 2.3 Jupiter masses, orbits host star HD 212771 at a distance of 1.22 AU.
The star itself, barely below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.6, is a G8IV (yellow subgiant) star located 131 parsecs from Earth.
Though it has a similar mass to the Sun 1.15 solar masses it is significantly less dense with its radius of 5 solar radii.
Its lone planet was discovered in 2010 by the radial velocity method, like several other exoplanets in the constellation.
As of 2013, there are only two multiple-planet systems within the bounds of Aquarius: the Gliese 876 and HD 215152 systems.
The former is quite prominent; the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at 21.5 parsecs.
The HD 215152 system consists of the planets HD 215152 b and HD 215152 c orbiting their K0-type, magnitude 8.13 sun.
Both discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method, the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star.
HD 215152 c is the larger at 0.0097 Jupiter masses (still significantly larger than the Earth, which weighs in at 0.00315 Jupiter masses); its smaller sibling is barely smaller at 0.0087 Jupiter masses.
The error in the mass measurements (0.0032 and 0.0049 MJ respectively) is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant.
HD 215152 c also orbits further from the star than HD 215152 b, 0.0852 AU compared to 0.0652.
Deep sky objects.
Because of its position away from the galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae.
Aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the  <START:person> Messier <END>  catalog: the globular clusters Messier 2,  <START:person> Messier <END>  72, and the open cluster  <START:person> Messier <END>  73.
Two well-known planetary nebulae are also located in Aquarius: the Saturn Nebula (NGC 7009), to the eastwest of μ Aquarii; and the famous Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), southwest of δ Aquarii.
M2, also catalogued as NGC 7089, is an incredibly rich globular cluster located approximately 37,000 light-years from Earth.
At magnitude 6.5, it is viewable in small-aperture instruments, but a 100 mm aperture telescope is needed to resolve any stars.
M72, also catalogued as NGC 6981, is a small 9th magnitude globular cluster located approximately 56,000 light-years from Earth.
M73, also catalogued as NGC 6994, is an open cluster with highly disputed status.
Aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae.
NGC 7009, also known as the Saturn Nebula, is an 8th magnitude planetary nebula located 3,000 light-years from Earth.
It was given its moniker by the 19th century astronomer Lord  <START:person> Rosse <END>  for its resemblance to the planet Saturn in a telescope; it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble Saturn's rings.
It appears blue-green in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude 11.3.
Compared to the Helix Nebula, another planetary nebula in Aquarius, it is quite small.
NGC 7293, also known as the Helix Nebula, is the closest planetary nebula to Earth at a distance of 650 light-years.
It covers 0.25 square degrees, making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from Earth.
However, because it is so large, it is only viewable as a very faint object, though it has a fairly high integrated magnitude of 6.0.
One of the visible galaxies in Aquarius is NGC 7727, of particular interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe supernovae.
A spiral galaxy (type S), it has an integrated magnitude of 10.7 and is 3 by 3 arcseconds.
NGC 7252 is a tangle of stars resulting from the collision of two large galaxies and is known as the Atoms-for-Peace galaxy because of its resemblance to a cartoon atom.
Meteor showers.
There are three major meteor showers with radiants in Aquarius: the Eta Aquariids, the Delta Aquariids, and the Iota Aquariids.
The Eta Aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from Aquarius.
It peaks between 5 and 6 May with a rate of approximately 35 meteors per hour.
Originally discovered by Chinese astronomers in 401 CE, Eta Aquariids can be seen coming from the Water Jar beginning on April 21 and as late as May 12.
The parent body of the shower is  <START:person> Halley <END> 's Comet, a periodic comet.
Fireballs are common shortly after the peak, approximately between May 9 and May 11.
The normal meteors appear to have yellow trails.
The Delta Aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 July and second on 6 August.
The first radiant is located in the south of the constellation, while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of Pisces asterism.
The southern radiant's peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour, while the northern radiant's peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour.
The Iota Aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on 6 August, with a rate of approximately 8 meteors per hour.
Astrology.
s of 2002[ [update]], the Sun appears in the constellation Aquarius from 16 February to 11 March.
In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Aquarius from 20 January to 19 February, and in sidereal astrology, from 15 February to 14 March.
Aquarius is also associated with the Age of Aquarius, a concept popular in 1960s counterculture.
Despite this prominence, the Age of Aquarius will not dawn until the year 2597, as an astrological age does not begin until the Sun is in a particular constellation on the vernal equinox.

Coordinates:    <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell  Alexander Graham Bell <END>  (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was an eminent Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer and innovator who is credited with inventing the first practical telephone.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing  <START:person> Bell <END> 's life's work.
His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.
Many other inventions marked  <START:person> Bell <END> 's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils and aeronautics.
In 1888,  <START:person> Bell <END>  became one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society.
Early life.
 <START:person> Alexander Bell <END>  was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3, 1847.
The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END> 's birthplace.
He had two brothers:  <START:person> Melville James Bell <END>  (1845–70) and  <START:person> Edward Charles Bell <END>  (1848–67).
Both of his brothers died of tuberculosis.
His father was Professor  <START:person> Alexander Melville Bell <END> , and his mother was  <START:person> Eliza Grace <END>  (née Symonds).
Although he was born "Alexander", at age 10, he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers.
For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the middle name " <START:person> Graham <END> ", chosen out of admiration for  <START:person> Alexander Graham <END> , a Canadian being treated by his father and boarder who had become a family friend.
To close relatives and friends he remained "Aleck" which his father continued to call him into later life.
First invention.
As a child, young  <START:person> Bell <END>  displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age.
His best friend was  <START:person> Ben Herdman <END> , a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays.
 <START:person> Young Bell <END>  asked what needed to be done at the mill.
He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.
In return,  <START:person> John Herdman <END>  gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to "invent".
From his early years,  <START:person> Bell <END>  showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother.
With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist.
Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.
He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study acoustics.
His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END> , in London, his uncle in Dublin, and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists.
His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his "The Standard Elocutionist" (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868.
"The Standard Elocutionist" appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone.
In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities.
He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic, and even Sanskrit, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.
Education.
As a young child,  <START:person> Bell <END> , like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father.
At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms.
His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades.
His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father.
Upon leaving school,  <START:person> Bell <END>  travelled to London to live with his grandfather,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END> .
During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study.
The elder  <START:person> Bell <END>  took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself.
At age 16, Bell secured a position as a "pupil-teacher" of elocution and music, in Weston House Academy, at Elgin, Moray, Scotland.
Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session.
The following year, he attended the University of Edinburgh; joining his older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  who had enrolled there the previous year.
In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family,  <START:person> Bell <END>  completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the University of London.
First experiments with sound.
His father encouraged  <START:person> Bell <END> ’s interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique automaton, developed by Sir  <START:person> Charles Wheatstone <END>  based on the earlier work of  <START:person> Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen <END> .
The rudimentary "mechanical man" simulated a human voice.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of  <START:person> von Kempelen <END> 's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  built their own automaton head.
Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful.
While his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull.
His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could "speak", albeit only a few words.
The boys would carefully adjust the "lips" and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe, a very recognizable "Mama" ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.
Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye Terrier, "Trouve".
After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding "Ow ah oo ga ma ma".
With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate "How are you grandma?"
More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a "talking dog".
However, these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using tuning forks to explore resonance.
At the age of 19, he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist  <START:person> Alexander Ellis <END> , a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor  <START:person> Henry Higgins <END>  in "Pygmalion").
 <START:person> Ellis <END>  immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of  <START:person> Hermann von Helmholtz <END> 's work, "The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music".
Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by  <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork "contraption", he pored over the German scientist's book.
Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: "Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech."
He also later remarked: "I thought that  <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity.
It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!"
Family tragedy.
In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London,  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment.
Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.
Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion.
His younger brother,  <START:person> Edward "Ted <END> ," was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from tuberculosis.
While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as "A.G.
Bell") and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, Bath, England, his brother's condition deteriorated.
 <START:person> Edward <END>  would never recover.
Upon his brother's death,  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned home in 1867.
His older brother  <START:person> Melville <END>  had married and moved out.
With aspirations to obtain a degree at the University College London,  <START:person> Bell <END>  considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.
Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to  <START:person> Susanna E. Hull <END> 's private school for the deaf in South Kensington, London.
His first two pupils were "deaf mute" girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage.
While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family,  <START:person> Bell <END>  continued as a teacher.
However, in May 1870,  <START:person> Melville <END>  died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis.
His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in Newfoundland.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly.
Acting decisively,  <START:person> Alexander Melville Bell <END>  asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property, conclude all of his brother's affairs ( <START:person> Bell <END>  took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp), and join his father and mother in setting out for the "New World".
Reluctantly,  <START:person> Bell <END>  also had to conclude a relationship with  <START:person> Marie Eccleston <END> , who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.
Canada.
In 1870, at age 23,  <START:person> Bell <END> , his brother's widow,  <START:person> Caroline <END>  ( <START:person> Margaret Ottaway <END> ), and his parents travelled on the SS "Nestorian" to Canada.
After landing at Quebec City the Bells transferred to another steamer to Montreal and then boarded a train to Paris, Ontario, to stay with the Reverend  <START:person> Thomas Henderson <END> , a family friend.
After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the  <START:person> Bell <END>  family purchased a farm of 10.5 acre at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near Brantford, Ontario.
The property consisted of an orchard, large farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house, and a carriage house, which bordered the Grand River.
At the homestead,  <START:person> Bell <END>  set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his "dreaming place", a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river.
Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly improved.
He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga, he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols.
For his work,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances.
After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on  <START:person> Helmholtz <END> 's work with electricity and sound.
He also modified a melodeon (a type of pump organ) so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance.
Once the family was settled in, both  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where  <START:person> Melville <END>  was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.
Work with the deaf.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's father was invited by  <START:person> Sarah Fuller <END> , principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public  <START:person> Horace Mann <END>  School for the Deaf), in Boston, Massachusetts, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post in favor of his son.
Traveling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors.
He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the American Asylum for Deaf-mutes in Hartford, Connecticut, and the  <START:person> Clarke <END>  School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts.
Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his "harmonic telegraph".
The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.
Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher.
His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting  <START:person> Gardiner Greene Hubbard <END> , the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation.
Teaching his father's system, in October 1872,  <START:person> Alexander Bell <END>  opened his "School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech" in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils, with his first class numbering 30 students.
While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was  <START:person> Helen Keller <END> , who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak.
She was later to say that  <START:person> Bell <END>  dedicated his life to the penetration of that "inhuman silence which separates and estranges."
In 1893,  <START:person> Keller <END>  performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of the new Bell's new Volta Bureau, dedicated to "the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf".
Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded.
In several schools, children were mistreated, for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing—the only language they knew—in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication.
Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing deaf culture.
Continuing experimentation.
In the following year,  <START:person> Bell <END>  became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory.
During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home.
At Boston University,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was "swept up" by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city.
He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation.
While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house.
Keeping "night owl" hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment.
Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover.
Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches.
Returning to Boston in fall 1873,  <START:person> Bell <END>  made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.
Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell retained only two students, six-year-old " <START:person> Georgie" Sanders <END> , deaf from birth, and 15-year-old  <START:person> Mabel Hubbard <END> .
Each pupil would play an important role in the next developments.
 <START:person> George <END> 's father,  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END> , a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby Salem with  <START:person> Georgie <END> 's grandmother, complete with a room to "experiment".
Although the offer was made by  <START:person> George <END> 's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr.  <START:person> Sanders <END>  was backing the proposal.
The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in.
 <START:person> Mabel <END>  was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years  <START:person> Bell <END> 's junior, but became the object of his affection.
Having lost her hearing after a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday, she had learned to read lips but her father,  <START:person> Gardiner Greene Hubbard <END> , Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.
Telephone.
By 1874,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston "laboratory" (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success.
While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a "phonautograph", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations.
Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound.
But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.
In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of Western Union President  <START:person> William Orton <END> , had become "the nervous system of commerce".
 <START:person> Orton <END>  had contracted with inventors  <START:person> Thomas Edison <END>  and  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines.
When  <START:person> Bell <END>  mentioned to  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END>  that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments.
Patent matters would be handled by  <START:person> Hubbard <END> 's patent attorney,  <START:person> Anthony Pollok <END> .
In March 1875, Bell and  <START:person> Pollok <END>  visited the famous scientist  <START:person> Joseph Henry <END> , who was then director of the Smithsonian Institution, and asked  <START:person> Henry <END> 's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph.
 <START:person> Henry <END>  replied that Bell had "the germ of a great invention".
When  <START:person> Bell <END>  said that he did not have the necessary knowledge,  <START:person> Henry <END>  replied, "Get it!"
That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas.
However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and  <START:person> Thomas A. Watson <END> , an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of  <START:person> Charles Williams <END> , changed all that.
With financial support from  <START:person> Sanders <END>  and  <START:person> Hubbard <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  hired  <START:person> Thomas Watson <END>  as his assistant, and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy.
On June 2, 1875,  <START:person> Watson <END>  accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech.
That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds.
This led to the "gallows" sound-powered telephone, which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.
The race to the patent office.
In 1875, Bell developed an acoustic telegraph and drew up a patent application for it.
Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas Sanders <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  requested that an associate in Ontario,  <START:person> George Brown <END> , attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).
Meanwhile,  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter.
On February 14, 1876,  <START:person> Gray <END>  filed a caveat with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter.
That same morning,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's lawyer filed  <START:person> Bell <END> 's application with the patent office.
There is considerable debate about who arrived first and  <START:person> Gray <END>  later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the U.S. Patent Office.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent covered "the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound"  <START:person> Bell <END>  returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.
On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued,  <START:person> Bell <END>  succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design.
Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the electrical resistance in the circuit.
When Bell spoke the famous sentence "Mr.
 <START:person> Watson <END> —Come here—I want to see you" into the liquid transmitter,  <START:person> Watson <END> , listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.
Although  <START:person> Bell <END>  was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray, Bell used  <START:person> Gray <END> 's water transmitter design only after  <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent had been granted, and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment, to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.
After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used  <START:person> Gray <END> 's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.
The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved  <START:person> Bell <END> 's patent application.
He told  <START:person> Bell <END>  that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which  <START:person> Bell <END>  described a cup of mercury, not water.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  described the water device.
In addition,  <START:person> Gray <END>  abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest  <START:person> Bell <END> 's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876.
Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but  <START:person> Bell <END>  was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.
The patent examiner,  <START:person> Zenas Fisk Wilber <END> , later stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer,  <START:person> Marcellus Bailey <END> , with whom he had served in the Civil War.
He claimed he showed  <START:person> Gray <END> 's patent caveat to  <START:person> Bailey <END> .
 <START:person> Wilber <END>  also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed  <START:person> Gray <END> 's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100.
Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray,  <START:person> Bell <END>  admitted that he learned some of the technical details.
Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave  <START:person> Wilber <END>  any money.
Later developments.
Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone.
On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles (eight km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready.
With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying.
The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel.
This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing.
These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  and his partners,  <START:person> Hubbard <END>  and  <START:person> Sanders <END> , offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000.
The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy.
Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25 million he would consider it a bargain.
By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent.
Bell's investors would become millionaires, while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.
Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public.
A short time later, his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia brought the telephone to international attention.
Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor  <START:person> Pedro II <END>  of Brazil.
Later Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to Sir  <START:person> William Thomson <END>  (later, Lord  <START:person> Kelvin <END> ), a renowned Scottish scientist, as well as to  <START:person> Queen Victoria <END> , who had requested a private audience at Osborne House, her Isle of  <START:person> Wight <END>  home.
She called the demonstration "most extraordinary".
The enthusiasm surrounding  <START:person> Bell <END> 's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.
The Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones.
Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever.
In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union.
This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.
In January 1915,  <START:person> Bell <END>  made the first ceremonial transcontinental telephone call.
Calling from the AT&T head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was heard by  <START:person> Thomas Watson <END>  at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco.
The "New York Times" reported: On October 9, 1876,  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  and  <START:person> Thomas A. Watson <END>  talked by telephone to each other over a two-mile wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston.
It was the first wire conversation ever held.
Yesterday afternoon [on January 25, 1915] the same two men talked by telephone to each other over a 3,400-mile wire between New York and San Francisco.
Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END> , the veteran inventor of the telephone, was in New York, and Mr.  <START:person> Watson <END> , his former associate, was on the other side of the continent.
They heard each other much more distinctly than they did in their first talk thirty-eight years ago.
Competitors.
As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone.
Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments.
The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by  <START:person> Elisha Gray <END>  and  <START:person> Amos Dolbear <END> .
In personal correspondence to Bell, both  <START:person> Gray <END>  and  <START:person> Dolbear <END>  had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.
On January 13, 1887, the U,S.
Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation.
After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided.
By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents (No. 174,465 dated March 7, 1876 and No. 186,787 dated January 30, 1877) were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case's importance as a "precedent".
With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the US Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on November 30, 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits.
During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Italian inventor  <START:person> Antonio Meucci <END>  also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834.
In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved,  <START:person> Meucci <END>  took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority.
 <START:person> Meucci <END> 's evidence in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York, which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in 1901.
 <START:person> Meucci <END> 's work, like many other inventors of the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving  <START:person> Meucci <END>  was eventually dropped upon  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's death.
However, due to the efforts of Congressman  <START:person> Vito Fossella <END> , the U.S. House of Representatives on June 11, 2002 stated that  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's "work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged", even though this did not put an end to a still contentious issue.
Some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that Bell's work on the telephone was influenced by  <START:person> Meucci <END> 's inventions.
The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world, and patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell had delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of Siemens & Halske (S&H) managed to set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent.
The Siemens company produced near-identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties.
The establishment of the International Bell Telephone Company in Brussels, Belgium in 1880, as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation.
The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court, necessitated by the legal battles, eventually resulted in his resignation from the company.
Family life.
On July 11, 1877, a few days after the Bell Telephone Company was established, Bell married  <START:person> Mabel Hubbard <END>  (1857–1923) at the  <START:person> Hubbard <END>  estate in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
His wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1,487 of his 1,497 shares in the newly formed Bell Telephone Company.
Shortly thereafter, the newlyweds embarked on a year-long honeymoon in Europe.
During that excursion,  <START:person> Bell <END>  took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a "working holiday".
The courtship had begun years earlier; however,  <START:person> Bell <END>  waited until he was more financially secure before marrying.
Although the telephone appeared to be an "instant" success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897.
One unusual request exacted by his fiancée was that he use "Alec" rather than the family's earlier familiar name of "Aleck".
From 1876, he would sign his name " <START:person> Alec Bell <END> ".
They had four children:  <START:person> Elsie May Bell <END>  (1878–1964) who married  <START:person> Gilbert Grosvenor <END>  of National Geographic fame,  <START:person> Marian Hubbard Bell <END>  (1880–1962) who was referred to as "Daisy", and two sons who died in infancy ( <START:person> Edward <END>  in 1881 and  <START:person> Robert <END>  in 1883).
The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when  <START:person> Bell <END> 's father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C., and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for  <START:person> Bell <END> 's family, so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was a British subject throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882, when he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
In 1915, he characterized his status as: "I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries."
Despite this declaration,  <START:person> Bell <END>  has been proudly claimed as a "native son" by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated.
That summer, the Bells had a vacation on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck.
Returning in 1886,  <START:person> Bell <END>  started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake.
By 1889, a large house, christened "The Lodge" was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Bells would name  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END>  (Gaelic: "beautiful mountain") after  <START:person> Bell <END> 's ancestral Scottish highlands.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  also built the Bell Boatyard on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the Royal Canadian Navy and pleasure craft for the Bell family.
An enthusiastic boater,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his family sailed a rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the  <START:person> H.W. Embree <END>  and Sons boatyard in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia.
In his final, and some of his most productive years,  <START:person> Bell <END>  split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn Bhreagh where they spent increasing amounts of time.
Until the end of his life,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his family would alternate between the two homes, but "Beinn Bhreagh" would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as  <START:person> Bell <END>  became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened.
Both  <START:person> Mabel <END>  and  <START:person> Bell <END>  became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as "their own".
The Bells were still in residence at "Beinn Bhreagh" when the Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6, 1917.
 <START:person> Mabel <END>  and  <START:person> Bell <END>  mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax.
Later inventions.
Although  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied.
According to one of his biographers,  <START:person> Charlotte Gray <END> , Bell's work ranged "unfettered across the scientific landscape" and he often went to bed voraciously reading the "Encyclopædia Britannica", scouring it for new areas of interest.
The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators.
These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the photophone, one for the phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for "hydroairplanes" and two for selenium cells.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding alternative fuels.
Bell worked extensively in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf.
During his Volta Laboratory period,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound.
Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype.
They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the hard disc and floppy disc drive and other magnetic media.
Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice.
He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution.
Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories.
At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere.
In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses.
Photophone.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  and his assistant  <START:person> Charles Sumner Tainter <END>  jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a photophone, which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of light.
Both men later became full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association.
On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the Franklin School in Washington, D.C., to  <START:person> Bell <END>  at the window of his laboratory, some 213 m away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  believed the photophone's principles were his life's "greatest achievement", telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was "the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone".
The photophone was a precursor to the fiber-optic communication systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s.
Its master patent was issued in December 1880, many decades before the photophone's principles came into popular use.
Metal detector.
Bell is also credited with the invention of the metal detector in 1881.
The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President  <START:person> James Garfield <END> .
According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static.
The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored  <START:person> Bell <END> 's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs.
Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's own detailed account, presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet.
Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of  <START:person> Garfield <END> , Bell "...proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning...to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed.
It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires.
Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes.
The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect."
In a footnote,  <START:person> Bell <END>  adds that "The death of President  <START:person> Garfield <END>  and the subsequent "post-mortem" examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus."
Hydrofoils.
The March 1906 "Scientific American" article by American pioneer  <START:person> William E. Meacham <END>  explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and hydroplanes.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement.
Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat.
Bell and assistant  <START:person> Frederick W. <END>  "Casey"  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water.
 <START:person> Baldwin <END>  studied the work of the Italian inventor  <START:person> Enrico Forlanini <END>  and began testing models.
This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.
During his world tour of 1910–11,  <START:person> Bell <END>  and  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  met with Forlanini in France.
They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore.
 <START:person> Baldwin <END>  described it as being as smooth as flying.
On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the "Dhonnas Beag", the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.
The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD-4, powered by Renault engines.
A top speed of 54 mph was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.
In 1913, Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END>  hired  <START:person> Walter Pinaud <END> , a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of  <START:person> Pinaud <END> 's Yacht Yard in Westmount, Nova Scotia to work on the pontoons of the HD-4.
 <START:person> Pinaud <END>  soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END> 's estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia.
 <START:person> Pinaud <END> 's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4.
After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4.
Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 hp engines in July 1919.
On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 mph, a record which stood for ten years.
Aeronautics.
In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft.
The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek "young" help as  <START:person> Bell <END>  was at the age of 60.
In 1898, Bell experimented with tetrahedral box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk.
The tetrahedral wings were named "Cygnet" I, II and  <START:person> III <END> , and were flown both unmanned and manned ("Cygnet I" crashed during a flight carrying  <START:person> Selfridge <END> ) in the period from 1907–1912.
Some of Bell's kites are on display at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife  <START:person> Mabel <END>  and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate.
The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men: American  <START:person> Glenn H. Curtiss <END> , a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title "world's fastest man", having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the Scientific American Trophy for the first official one-kilometre flight in the Western hemisphere, and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant  <START:person> Thomas Selfridge <END> , an official observer from the U.S. Federal government and one of the few people in the army who believed that aviation was the future;  <START:person> Frederick W. Baldwin <END> , the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in Hammondsport, New York, and  <START:person> J.A.D. McCurdy <END>  — <START:person> Baldwin <END>  and  <START:person> McCurdy <END>  being new engineering graduates from the University of Toronto.
The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders.
Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the "Red Wing", framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine.
On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.
The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control).
One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the aileron, was to become a standard component on all aircraft.
The "White Wing" and "June Bug" were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished.
However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $15,000 grant from Mrs.  <START:person> Bell <END>  allowed it to continue with experiments.
Lt.  <START:person> Selfridge <END>  had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the Wright Flyer at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908.
Their final aircraft design, the "Silver Dart", embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines.
On February 23, 1909,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was present as the "Silver Dart" flown by  <START:person> J.A.D. McCurdy <END>  from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or, made the first aircraft flight in Canada.
Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand.
With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the "Silver Dart" would revert to  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  and  <START:person> McCurdy <END>  who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the Canadian Army.
Eugenics.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was connected with the eugenics movement in the United States.
In his lecture "Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race" presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry.
However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist  <START:person> David Starr Jordan <END> 's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the American Breeders Association.
The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man.
From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugenics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and regularly attended meetings.
In 1921, he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be, as  <START:person> Bell <END>  called them, a "defective variety of the human race".
By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany.
Legacy and honors.
Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his most famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew.
Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities, to the point that the requests almost became burdensome.
During his life he also received dozens of major awards, medals and other tributes.
These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created, notably the Bell Telephone Memorial erected in his honor in " <START:person> Alexander Graham <END>  Bell Gardens" in Brantford, Ontario, in 1917.
A large number of Bell's writings, personal correspondence, notebooks, papers and other documents reside at both the United States Library of Congress Manuscript Division (as the " <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  Family Papers"), and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute, Cape Breton University, Nova Scotia; major portions of which are available for online viewing.
A number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North America and Europe, including the first telephone companies of the United States and Canada.
Among the major sites are: In 1880, Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$ in today's dollars) for the invention of the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government.
Among the luminaries who judged were  <START:person> Victor Hugo <END>  and  <START:person> Alexandre Dumas <END> .
The Volta Prize was conceived by  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END>  in 1801, and named in honor of  <START:person> Alessandro Volta <END> , with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history.
Since  <START:person> Bell <END>  was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C..
These included the prestigious" 'Volta Laboratory Association' "(1880), also known as the" Volta Laboratory "and as the" ' <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  Laboratory', "and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.
The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that  <START:person> Edison <END>  himself later adopted.
The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his "proudest achievement", "the photophone", the "optical telephone" which presaged fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.
In partnership with  <START:person> Gardiner Hubbard <END> ,  <START:person> Bell <END>  helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s.
In 1888,  <START:person> Bell <END>  was one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society and became its second president (1897–1904), and also became a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution (1898–1922).
The French government conferred on him the decoration of the Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor); the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 1902; the University of Würzburg, Bavaria, granted him a PhD, and he was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912.
He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884, and served as its president from 1891–92.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  was later awarded the AIEE's Edison Medal in 1914 "For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone".
The "bel" (B) and the smaller "decibel" (dB) are units of measurement of sound intensity invented by Bell Labs and named after him.
Since 1976 the IEEE's  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell Medal <END>  has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications.
In 1936 the US Patent Office declared Bell first on its list of the country's greatest inventors, leading to the US Post Office issuing a commemorative stamp honoring Bell in 1940 as part of its 'Famous Americans Series'.
The First Day of Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston, Massachusetts, the city where  <START:person> Bell <END>  spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf.
The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time.
The stamp became, and remains to this day, the most valuable one of the series.
The 150th anniversary of Bell's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative £1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell's face in profile, his signature, and objects from Bell's life and career: users of the telephone over the ages; an audio wave signal; a diagram of a telephone receiver; geometric shapes from engineering structures; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet; the geese which helped him to understand flight; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics.
Additionally, the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C$100 gold coin, in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth, and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada.
That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr.  <START:person> Bell <END> 's tutelage, named the  <START:person> Silver Dart <END> .
Bell's image, and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money, coinage and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years.
 <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  was ranked 57th among the 100 Greatest Britons (2002) in an official BBC nationwide poll, and among the Top Ten Greatest Canadians (2004), and the 100 Greatest Americans (2005).
In 2006 Bell was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history after having been listed in the National Library of Scotland's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame'.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's name is still widely known and used as part of the names of dozens of educational institutes, corporate namesakes, street and place names around the world.
Honorary degrees.
 <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END> , who could not complete the university program of his youth, received at least a dozen honorary degrees from academic institutions, including eight honorary LL.D.s (Doctorate of Laws), two Ph.D.s, a D.Sc. and an M.D.: Death.
 <START:person> Bell <END>  died of complications arising from diabetes on August 2, 1922, at his private estate,  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END> , Nova Scotia, at age 75.
Bell had also been afflicted with pernicious anemia.
His last view of the land he had inhabited was by moonlight on his mountain estate at 2:00 A.M.
While tending to him after his long illness,  <START:person> Mabel <END> , his wife, whispered, "Don't leave me."
By way of reply,  <START:person> Bell <END>  traced the sign for "no" in the air —and then he died.
On learning of Bell's death, the Canadian Prime Minister,  <START:person> Mackenzie King <END> , cabled Mrs.  <START:person> Bell <END> , saying: "My colleagues in the Government join with me in expressing to you our sense of the world's loss in the death of your distinguished husband.
It will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention, with which his name is immortally associated, is a part of its history.
On the behalf of the citizens of Canada, may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy.
 <START:person> Bell <END> 's coffin was constructed of  <START:person> Beinn Bhreagh <END>  pine by his laboratory staff, lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite experiments.
To help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests not to wear black (the traditional funeral color) while attending his service, during which soloist  <START:person> Jean MacDonald <END>  sang a verse of  <START:person> Robert Louis Stevenson <END> 's "Requiem": Upon the conclusion of Bell's funeral, "every phone on the continent of North America was silenced in honor of the man who had given to mankind the means for direct communication at a distance".
Dr.  <START:person> Alexander Graham Bell <END>  was buried atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain, on his estate where he had resided increasingly for the last 35 years of his life, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake.
He was survived by his wife  <START:person> Mabel <END> , his two daughters,  <START:person> Elsie May <END>  and  <START:person> Marian <END> , and nine of his grandchildren.

Patents.
"U.S. patent images in TIFF format"  Aaron  In the Hebrew Bible and the Quran,  <START:person> Aaron אַהֲרֹן <END>  () was the older brother of Moses (Exodus 6:16-20, 7:7; Qur'an 28:34), a prophet of God.
Unlike  <START:person> Moses <END> , who grew up in the Egyptian royal court,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his younger sister  <START:person> Miriam <END>  remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen).
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  served as his brother's spokesman ("prophet") to Pharaoh.
() Part of the Law (Torah) that  <START:person> Moses <END>  received from God at Sinai granted  <START:person> Aaron <END>  the priesthood for himself and his male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites.
Various dates for his life have been proposed, ranging from approximately 1600 to 1200 BC.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  died before the Israelites crossed the Jordan river and he was buried on Mount Hor (Numbers 33:39; Deuteronomy 10:6 says he died and was buried at Moserah.)  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible.
Account in the Hebrew Bible.
Traditional genealogy.
Descended from " <START:person> Abraham <END> ", " <START:person> Isaac <END> ", and "Jacob" Great-grandfather: "Levi" Grandfather: "Kohath" Father: "Amram" Mother: "Jochebed" Older Sister: " <START:person> Miriam <END> " Younger Brother: "Moses" Uncles: "Izhar", "Hebron", "Uzziel" Wife: "Elisheba" Sons: "Nadab, Abihu", "Eleazar", "Ithamar" Grandson: "Phinehas" According to the Book of Exodus,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  first functioned as  <START:person> Moses <END> ' assistant.
Because  <START:person> Moses <END>  complained that he could not speak well, God appointed  <START:person> Aaron <END>  as  <START:person> Moses <END> ' "prophet" (Exodus 4:10-17; 7:1).
At the command of  <START:person> Moses <END> , he let his rod turn into a snake (Exodus 7:9-12).
Then he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues (Exodus 7:19, 8:1,12).
After that,  <START:person> Moses <END>  tended to act and speak for himself (Exodus 9:23, 10:13,22).
During the journey in the wilderness,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was not always prominent or active.
At the battle with  <START:person> Amalek <END> , he was chosen with  <START:person> Hur <END>  to support the hand of Moses that held the "rod of God" (Exodus 17:9).
When the revelation was given to  <START:person> Moses <END>  at Mount Sinai, he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied  <START:person> Moses <END>  on the way to the summit.
While  <START:person> Joshua <END>  went with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to the top, however,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and  <START:person> Hur <END>  remained below to look after the people (Exodus 24:9-14).
From here on in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers,  <START:person> Joshua <END>  appears in the role of  <START:person> Moses <END> ' assistant while  <START:person> Aaron <END>  functions instead as the first high priest.
High Priest.
The books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers maintain that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  received from God a monopoly over the priesthood for himself and his male descendants (Exodus 28:1).
The family of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to the God of Israel.
The rest of his tribe, the Levites, were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary (Numbers 3).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  anointed and consecrated  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his sons to the priesthood, and arrayed them in the robes of office (Leviticus 8; cf.
Exodus 28-29).
He also related to them God's detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the Israelites listened (Leviticus 1-7, 11-27).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his successors as high priest were given control over the Urim and Thummim by which the will of God could be determined (Exodus 28:30).
God commissioned the Aaronide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean, and to teach the divine laws (the Torah) to the Israelites (Leviticus 10:10-11).
The priests were also commissioned to bless the people (Numbers 6:22-27).
When  <START:person> Aaron <END>  completed the altar offerings for the first time and, with  <START:person> Moses <END> , "blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people: And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces" (Leviticus 9:23-24).
In this way, the institution of the Aaronide priesthood was established.
In later books of the Old Testament,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later.
The books of Judges,  <START:person> Samuel <END>  and Kings mention priests and  <START:person> Levites <END> , but do not mention the Aaronides in particular.
The book of Ezekial, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King  <START:person> David <END> 's priests.
It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position.
A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and  <START:person> Levites <END>  appears in Ezra,  <START:person> Nehemiah <END>  and Chronicles.
As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel.
What is clear is that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period.
Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form early in this period, which may account for  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.
Leadership conflicts.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  plays a leading role in several stories of conflicts over leadership during Israel's wilderness wanderings.
During the prolonged absence of Moses on Mount Sinai, the people provoked  <START:person> Aaron <END>  to make a Golden Calf as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from Egypt (Exodus 32:1-6).
This incident nearly caused God to destroy the Israelites for their unfaithfulness to the covenant (Exodus 32:10).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  successfully intervened, but then led the loyal  <START:person> Levites <END>  in executing many of the culprits and a plague afflicted those who were left (Exodus 32:25-35).
 <START:person> Aaron <END> , however, escaped punishment for his role in the affair, because of the intercession of Moses according to Deuteronomy 9:20.
Later retellings of this story almost always excuse  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for his role.
For example, in rabbinic sources and in the Qur'an,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was not the idol-maker and upon  <START:person> Moses <END> ' return begged his pardon because he felt mortally threatened by the Israelites (Quran 7:142-152).
On the day of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's consecration, his oldest sons,  <START:person> Nadab <END>  and  <START:person> Abihu <END> , were burned up by divine fire because they offered "strange" incense (Leviticus 10:1-3).
Most interpreters think this story reflects a conflict between priestly families sometime in Israel's past.
Others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow God's instructions given through Moses.
The Pentateuch generally depicts the siblings, Moses,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , and  <START:person> Miriam <END> , as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus, a view also reflected in the biblical book of  <START:person> Micah <END> .
Numbers 12, however, reports that on one occasion,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and  <START:person> Miriam <END>  complained about  <START:person> Moses <END> ' exclusive claim to be the LORD's prophet.
Their presumption was rebuffed by God who affirmed  <START:person> Moses <END> ' uniqueness as the one with whom the LORD spoke face to face.
 <START:person> Miriam <END>  was punished with skin disease ("leprous"), that turned her skin white.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  pleaded with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to intercede for her, and  <START:person> Miriam <END> , after seven days' quarantine, was healed.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  once again escaped any retribution.
According to Numbers 16-17, a  <START:person> Levite <END>  named  <START:person> Korah <END>  led many in challenging  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's exclusive claim to the priesthood.
When the rebels were punished by being swallowed up by the earth, (Numbers 16:25-35),  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , the son of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests.
And when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).
To emphasize the validity of the  <START:person> Levites <END> ' claim to the offerings and tithes of the Israelites,  <START:person> Moses <END>  collected a rod from the leaders of each tribe in Israel and laid the twelve rods over night in the tent of meeting.
The next morning,  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds (Numbers 17:23).
The following chapter then details the distinction between  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's family and the rest of the Levites: while all the Levites (and only  <START:person> Levites <END> ) were devoted to the care of the sanctuary, charge of its interior and the altar was committed to the Aaronites alone (Numbers 18:1-7).
Death.
 <START:person> Aaron <END> , like  <START:person> Moses <END> , was not permitted to enter Canaan with the Israelites because the two brothers showed impatience at Meribah (Kadesh) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage (Numbers 20:12-13), when  <START:person> Moses <END>  brought water out of a rock to quench the people's thirst.
Though they had been commanded to speak to the rock,  <START:person> Moses <END>  struck it with the staff twice, which was construed as displaying a lack of deference to the LORD (Numbers 20:7-11).
There are two accounts of the death of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the Pentateuch.
Numbers says that soon after the incident at Meribah,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  with his son  <START:person> Eleazar <END>  and  <START:person> Moses <END>  ascended  <START:person> Mount Hor <END> .
There Moses stripped  <START:person> Aaron <END>  of his priestly garments and transferred them to  <START:person> Eleazar <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days (Numbers 20:22-29; compare 33:38-39).
The other account is found in Deuteronomy 10:6, where  <START:person> Aaron <END>  died at Moserah and was buried.
There is a significant amount of travel between these two points, as the itinerary in Numbers 33:31–37 records seven stages between Moseroth (Mosera) and  <START:person> Mount Hor <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  was 123 at the time of his death.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in religious traditions.
Jewish Rabbinic literature.
The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of God and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities.
Thus  <START:person> Aaron <END> , the first priest, ranks below Moses: he is his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of God revealed through Moses, although it is pointed out that it is said fifteen times in the Pentateuch that "the Lord spoke to Moses "and"  <START:person> Aaron <END> ."
Under the influence of the priesthood that shaped the destinies of the nation under Persian rule, a different ideal of the priest was formed, according to  <START:person> Malachi <END>  2:4–7, and the prevailing tendency was to place  <START:person> Aaron <END>  on a footing equal with  <START:person> Moses <END> .
"At times  <START:person> Aaron <END> , and at other times Moses, is mentioned first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank," says  <START:person> Mekilta <END> , who strongly implies this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's ministration.
In fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head ( <START:person> Leviticus Rabbah <END>  x., Midrash Teh.
cxxxiii.
1),  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death, as described in the Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquility.
Accompanied by  <START:person> Moses <END> , his brother, and by  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , his son,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view.
"Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son  <START:person> Eleazar <END> !" said  <START:person> Moses <END> ; "and then follow me."
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood.
"Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother,"  <START:person> Moses <END>  continued; and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  obeyed without a murmur.
Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God.
The cave closed behind  <START:person> Moses <END>  as he left; and he went down the hill with  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , with garments rent, and crying: "Alas,  <START:person> Aaron <END> , my brother!
thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!"
When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, "Where is  <START:person> Aaron <END> ?" angels were seen carrying  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's bier through the air.
A voice was then heard saying: "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" ( <START:person> Malachi <END>  2:6).
He died, according to Seder Olam Rabbah ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab."
The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and  <START:person> R. H. 2b-3a <END> ).
The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq.
and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner:  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of  <START:person> Arad <END> , in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for  <START:person> Aaron <END> ; wherefore it is said: "There [at Mosera] died  <START:person> Aaron <END> ."
The rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and Moses.
When the latter was appointed ruler and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one another's greatness.
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  at first declined to go to Pharaoh, saying: "O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send" (Exodus 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive  <START:person> Aaron <END> , his brother, of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but the Lord reassured him, saying: "Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart" ().
Indeed,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was to find his reward, says  <START:person> Shimon <END>  bar  <START:person> Yochai <END> ; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother's rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the Urim and Thummim, which were to "be upon  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's heart when he goeth in before the Lord" ( <START:person> Canticles Rabbah <END>  i. 10).
 <START:person> Moses <END>  and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  met in gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers (Exodus 4:27; compare Song of Songs 8:1), and of them it is written: "Behold how good and how pleasant [it is] for brethren to dwell together in unity!" (Psalms 133:1).
Of them it is said: "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other]" (Psalms 85:10); for  <START:person> Moses <END>  stood for righteousness, according to Deuteronomy 33:21, and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for peace, according to .
Again, mercy was personified in  <START:person> Aaron <END> , according to Deuteronomy 33:8, and truth in Moses, according to Numbers 12:7 .
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  poured the oil of anointment upon the head of  <START:person> Aaron <END> ,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  modestly shrank back and said: "Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office."
Then the Shekhinah spoke the words: "Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of Hermon" () .
According to  <START:person> Tanhuma <END> ,  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's activity as a prophet began earlier than that of Moses.
 <START:person> Hillel <END>  held  <START:person> Aaron <END>  up as an example, saying: "Be of the disciples of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , loving peace and pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law!"
This is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in Abot de-Rabbi Natan 12, Sanhedrin 6b, and elsewhere, according to which  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was an ideal priest of the people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was Moses.
While  <START:person> Moses <END>  was stern and uncompromising, brooking no wrong,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  went about as peacemaker, reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse.
The mourning of the people at  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's death was greater, therefore, than at that of Moses; for whereas, when  <START:person> Aaron <END>  died the whole house of Israel wept, including the women, (Numbers 20:29)  <START:person> Moses <END>  was bewailed by "the sons of Israel" only (Deuteronomy 34:8).
Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
His fortitude and silent submission to the will of God on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify God in the midst of great affliction.
Especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by God after the princes of the Twelve Tribes had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: "Say to thy brother  <START:person> Aaron <END> : Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light shall last forever."
Christianity.
In the Eastern Orthodox and Maronite churches,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is venerated as a saint whose feast day is shared with his brother  <START:person> Moses <END>  and celebrated on September 4. (Those churches that follow the traditional Julian Calendar celebrate this day on September 17 of the modern Gregorian Calendar).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is also commemorated with other Old Testament saints on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers, the Sunday before Christmas.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 30.
He is commemorated on July 1 in the modern Latin calendar and in the Syriac Calendar.
In The Church of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  of Latter-day Saints, the Aaronic order is the lesser order of priesthood, comprising the grades (from lowest to highest) of deacon, teacher, and priest.
The chief office of the Aaronic priesthood is the presiding bishopric; the head of the priesthood is the bishop.
Each ward includes a quorum of one or more of each office of the Aaronic priesthood.
In the Community of Christ, the Aaronic order of priesthood is regarded as an appendage to the Melchisedec order, and consists of the priesthood offices of deacon, teacher, and priest.
While differing in responsibilities, these offices, along with those of the Melchisidec order, are regarded as equal before God.
Islam.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Arabic: هارون, "Hārūn") is also mentioned in the Quran as a prophet of God.
The Quran praises  <START:person> Aaron <END>  repeatedly, calling him a "believing servant" as well as one who was "guided" and one of the "victors".
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is important in Islam for his role in the events of the Exodus, in which, according to the Quran and Muslim tradition, he preached with his brother  <START:person> Moses <END>  to the Pharaoh of the Exodus.
 <START:person> Aaron <END> 's significance in Islam, however, is not limited to his role as the helper of Moses.
Islamic tradition also accords  <START:person> Aaron <END>  the role of a patriarch, as tradition records that the priestly descent came through  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's lineage, which included the entire House of Amran.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the Quran.
The Qur'an contains numerous references to  <START:person> Aaron <END> , both by name and without name.
It says that he was a descendant of  <START:person> Abraham <END>  (Qur'an 4: 163) and makes it clear that both he and  <START:person> Moses <END>  were sent together to warn the Pharaoh about God's punishment (Qur'an 10: 75).
It further adds that  <START:person> Moses <END>  had earlier prayed to God to strengthen his own ministry with  <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Qur'an 20: 29-30) and that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  helped  <START:person> Moses <END>  as he too was a prophet (Qur'an 19: 53) and was very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse (Qur'an 28: 34).
The Qur'an adds that both Moses and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the Israelites in Egypt, and to convert those houses into places of worship for God (Qur'an 10: 87).
The incident of the Golden Calf as it is narrated in the Qur'an paints  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in a positive light.
The Qur'an says that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was entrusted the leadership of Israel while  <START:person> Moses <END>  was up on Mount Sinai for a period of forty days (Qur'an 7: 142).
It adds that  <START:person> Aaron <END>  tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf, which was built not by  <START:person> Aaron <END>  but by a wicked man by the name of  <START:person> Samiri <END>  (Qur'an 19: 50).
When  <START:person> Moses <END>  returned from Mount Sinai, he rebuked  <START:person> Aaron <END>  for allowing the worship of the idol, to which  <START:person> Aaron <END>  pleaded with  <START:person> Moses <END>  to not blame him when he had no role in its construction (Qur'an 7: 150).
The Qur'an then adds that  <START:person> Moses <END>  here lamented the sins of Israel and said he only had the power to protect himself and  <START:person> Aaron <END>  (Qur'an 5: 25).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  is later commemorated in the Qur'an as one who had a "clear authority" (Qur'an 23: 45) and one who was "guided to the Right Path" (Qur'an 37: 118).
It further adds that  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's memory was left for people who came after him (Qur'an 37: 119) and he is blessed by God along with his brother (Qur'an 37: 120).
The Qur'an also calls the  <START:person> Virgin Mary <END>  a "sister of Aaron" (Qur'an 19: 28).
Muslim scholars debated as to who exactly this "Aaron" was in terms of his historical persona, with some saying that it was a reference to  <START:person> Aaron <END>  of the Exodus, and the term "sister" designating only a metaphorical or spiritual link between the two figures, all the more evident when  <START:person> Mary <END>  was a descendant of the priestly lineage of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , while others held it to be another righteous man living at the time of  <START:person> Christ <END>  by the name of "Aaron".
Most scholars have agreed to the former perspective, and have linked  <START:person> Mary <END>  spiritually with the actual sister of  <START:person> Aaron <END> , her namesake  <START:person> Miriam <END> , whom she resembled in many ways.
The Qur'an also narrates that, centuries later, when the Ark of the Covenant returned to Israel, it contained "relics from the family of  <START:person> Moses <END>  and relics from the family of  <START:person> Aaron <END> " (Qur'an 2: 248).
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  in  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's time.
 <START:person> Muhammad <END> , in many of his sayings, speaks of  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
In the event of the Mi'raj, his miraculous ascension through the Heavens,  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  is said to have encountered  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the fifth heaven.
According to old scholars, including  <START:person> Ibn Hisham <END> ,  <START:person> Muhammad <END> , in particular, mentioned the beauty of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  when he encountered him in Heaven.
 <START:person> Martin Lings <END> , in his biographical " <START:person> Muhammad <END> ", speaks of  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's wonderment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory: Of  <START:person> Joseph <END>  he said that his face had the splendour of the moon at its full, and that he had been endowed with no less than the half of all existing beauty.
Yet this did not diminish  <START:person> Muhammad <END> 's wonderment at his other brethren, and he mentioned in particular the great beauty of  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  was also mentioned by  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  in likeness to  <START:person> Ali <END> .
 <START:person> Muhammad <END>  had left  <START:person> Ali <END>  to look after his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found  <START:person> Ali <END>  a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence.
 <START:person> Ali <END> , grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told  <START:person> Muhammad <END>  what the local people were saying.
In reply, the  <START:person> Prophet <END>  said: "They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me.
So return and represent me in my family and in thine.
Art thou not content,  <START:person> O Ali <END> , that thou should be unto me as  <START:person> Aaron <END>  was unto  <START:person> Moses <END> , save that after me there is no prophet.
" Burial Place.
According to Islamic tradition the tomb of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is located on "Jabal Harun", or  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's Mountain, near Petra in Jordan.
At 1350 meters above sea-level it is the highest peak in the area; and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here.
A 14th-century Mamluk mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around Petra.
Baha'i.
Although his father is described as both an apostle and a prophet,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is merely described as a prophet.
The Kitab-I-Iqan describes  <START:person> Imran <END>  as being his father.
Descendants.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  married  <START:person> Elisheba <END> , daughter of  <START:person> Amminadab <END>  and sister of  <START:person> Nahshon <END>  (Exodus 6:23) of the tribe of  <START:person> Judah <END> .
The sons of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  were  <START:person> Eleazar <END> , Ithamar, and Nadab and  <START:person> Abihu <END> .
A descendant of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  is an Aaronite, or  <START:person> Kohen <END> , meaning Priest.
Any non-Aaronic  <START:person> Levite <END> —i.e., descended from  <START:person> Levi <END>  but not from  <START:person> Aaron <END> —assisted the Levitical priests of the family of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  in the care of the tabernacle; later of the temple.
The Gospel of  <START:person> Luke <END>  records that the priest  <START:person> Zechariah <END> , his wife  <START:person> Elizabeth <END>  and therefore their son  <START:person> John the Baptist <END>  were descendants of  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
Art history.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  appears paired with  <START:person> Moses <END>  frequently in Jewish and Christian art, especially in the illustrations of manuscript and printed Bibles.
He can usually be distinguished by his priestly vestments, especially his turban or miter and jeweled breastplate.
He frequently holds a censor or, sometimes, his flowering rod.
(See at Wikimedia Commons.)
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  also appears in scenes depicting the wilderness Tabernacle and its altar, as already in the third-century frescos in the synagogue at Dura-Europos in Syria.
An eleventh-century portable silver altar from Fulda, Germany depicts  <START:person> Aaron <END>  with his censor, and is located in the Musée National de l’Age Médiévale in Paris.
This is also how he appears in the frontispieces of early printed Passover Haggadot and occasionally in church sculptures.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  has rarely been the subject of portraits, such as those by  <START:person> Anton Kern <END>  [1710–1747] and by  <START:person> Pier Francesco Mola <END>  [c.
1650].
Christian artists sometimes portray  <START:person> Aaron <END>  as a prophet (Exod.
7:1) holding a scroll, as in a twelfth-century sculpture from the Cathedral of Noyon in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and often in Eastern Orthodox icons.
Illustrations of the Golden Calf story usually include him as well—most notably in  <START:person> Nicolas Poussin <END> 's "The Adoration of the Golden Calf" (ca.
1633–34, National Gallery London).
Finally, some artists interested in validating later priesthoods have painted the ordination of  <START:person> Aaron <END>  and his sons (Leviticus 8).
 <START:person> Harry Anderson <END> 's realistic portrayal is often reproduced in the literature of the Latter Day Saints.

</dl>  Economy of Armenia  Armenia is the second most densely populated of the former Soviet republics because of its small size.
It is situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, bordered on the north and east by Georgia and Azerbaijan and on the south and west by Iran and Turkey.
Until independence, Armenia's economy was based largely on industry—chemicals, electronic products, machinery, processed food, synthetic rubber and textiles; it was highly dependent on outside resources.
Agriculture accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold and lead.
The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant) from Russia; the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric.
Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.
Like other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns.
Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function.
In addition, the effects of the 1988 earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt.
Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved.
The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials.
Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable.
In 1992-93, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level.
The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.
Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years.
New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily Armentel, which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors).
This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans.
Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed $800 million.
These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the earthquake zone.
Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and accelerating privatization.
A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization.
The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization.
By 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005.
Armenia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2003.
Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most smalland medium-sized enterprises.
Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth.
The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under international pressure to close.
The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002.
Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment.
Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector.
The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in 2005, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement.
Investment in the construction and industrial sectors is expected to continue in 2006 and will help to ensure annual average real GDP growth of about 13.9%.
Overview.
Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy.
Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era.
The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology.
The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration.
Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (gold and bauxite) are small.
The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.
By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-99.
Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most smalland medium-sized enterprises.
The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor.
Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic restructuring and foreign direct investment.
History of the modern Armenian economy.
Armenia emerged from the umbra of the former Soviet Union in 1991 and migrated from a centrally planned economy (Communist system) to a market economy (capitalist system).
Both the nation and the economy are nascent.
Regional conflict retards economic growth.
In addition, the border with Turkey is closed, making access to sea ports difficult and transportation logistics challenging to a country largely dependent upon imports.
In 2003, Armenia became a member of the WTO.
The nation is making substantial progress in privatizing ownership of what used to be state-owned industries under the former Soviet system.
Despite marked progress, Armenia still suffers from a large trade imballance and is still largely dependent upon foreign aid and remittances from Armenian nationals working abroad, and members of the diaspora donating aid through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as churchES.
There are some foreign capital inflows, but no robust foreign investment.
Despite progress since the Soviet era, the unemployment rate still hovers near 30% and there remains a huge gulf between actual and potential Gross Domestic Product.
Global competitiveness.
The Armenian economy's competitiveness is low and stagnating according to the Global Competitiveness Index, in which Armenia's ranking slipped from 80th out of 132 countries in 2006-2007 index to 93rd out of 131 countries in the 2007-2008 index (just below Libya, Namibia, Georgia, Serbia and Pakistan).
Armenia ranks 82nd out of 144 economies according to the 2012-2013 Global Competitiveness Index.
Index of Economic Freedom.
Armenia ranks 39th out of 179 economies according to the 2012 Index of Economic Freedom.
Armenia is ranked 19th freest among the 43 countries in the Europe region, putting it above the world and regional averages.
Domestic business environment.
Armenia ranks 32nd out of 185 economies according to the 2013 ease of doing business index .
Armenia's economy is competitive to a few extent with government-connected individuals enjoying de facto monopolies over the import and distribution of basic commodities and foodstuffs, and under-reporting revenue to avoid paying taxes.
Despite pronouncements at the highest levels of government on the importance of free competition, Armenia is next to last in the effectiveness of its anti-monopoly policy according to the 2010 results of the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.
According to  <START:person> Vahram Nercissiantz <END> , President  <START:person> Serzh Sargsyan <END> 's chief economic adviser, "Businessmen holding state positions have turned into oligarchs who have avoided paying sufficient taxes by abusing their state positions, distorted markets with unequal conditions, breached the rules of competition, impeded or prevented small and medium-sized business’ entry into manufacturing and thereby sharply deepened social polarization in the republic.
Following the advice of economic advisors who cautioned Armenia's leadership against the consolidation of economic power in the hands of a few, in January 2001, the Government of Armenia established the .
Its members cannot be dismissed by the government.
Monopolies.
According to one analyst, Armenia's economic system is anticompetitive due to the structure of the economy being a type of "monopoly or oligopoly".
"The result is the prices with us do not drop even if they do on international market, or they do quite belated and not to the size of the international market."
According to the estimate of a former prime minister,  <START:person> Hrant Bagratian <END> , 55 percent of Armenia's GDP is controlled by 44 families.
In early 2008, the State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition named 60 companies having "dominant positions" in Armenia.
In October 2009, when visiting Yerevan, the World Bank’s managing director, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, warned that Armenia will not reach a higher level of development unless its leadership changes the "oligopolistic" structure of the national economy, bolsters the rule of law and shows "zero tolerance" towards corruption.
"I think you can only go so far with this economic model,"  <START:person> Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala <END>  told a news conference in Yerevan.
"Armenia is a lower middle-income country.
If it wants to become a high-income or upper middle-income country, it can not do so with this kind of economic structure.
That is clear."
She also called for a sweeping reform of tax and customs administration, the creation of a "strong and independent judicial system" as well as a tough fight against government corruption.
The warning was echoed by the International Monetary Fund.
Major monopolies in Armenia include: "Former" major monopolies in Armenia include: GDP.
The Gross Domestic Product of Armenia stood at 8.8 billion US dollars in 2010; with a population of 3.2 million, this amounts to a GDP per capita of $2,676 (purchasing power parity $5,178).
GDP growth for 2010 was at 2.9 percent, and inflation was at 8 percent.
GDP growth is expected to be around 3 percent in 2011, with inflation returning to 4-5 percent.
In comparison, in 2006, the GDP was estimated to be 6.6 billion USD per calendar year and the GDP per capita (purchasing power parity) was estimated at $5,400 US.
The growth rate was high at 13.4%, but the relatively low base must be considered.
Low inflation was maintained around 2.6% annually.
Growth.
After a decade of double-digit growth, Armenia's economy declined by 14.4 percent in 2009.
The year-to-date growth as of October 2010 was 2.8 percent.
In 2010, the main macro deficiencies of the Armenian economy — namely, unsustainable growth drivers, a narrow and resource-dominated export base, and overdependence on private transfers — were still prevalent.
According to official figures, Armenia’s economy grew by 13.8 percent in 2007.
According to research funded by the USAID CAPS project, Armenia's exceptionally high rate of economic growth during the last decade has been largely dependent on external factors (e.g., remittances, assistance from international financial and donor organization).
Furthermore, the study concluded that despite its record growth on most macro-economic metrics, Armenia is "low and lagging" in competitiveness.
According to the National Statistical Service, the booming construction and service sectors remain the driving forces of the high growth rate of GDP.
Cash remittances.
Cash remittances sent back home from Armenians working abroad—mostly in Russia and the United States—are growing and contribute significantly to Armenia's Gross Domestic Product (between 15 to 30 percent).
They help Armenia sustain double-digit economic growth and finance its massive trade deficit.
According to the Central Bank of Armenia, during the first half of 2008, cash remittances sent back to Armenia by Armenians working abroad rose by 57.5 percent and totaled $668.6 million USD, equivalent to 15 percent of the country's first-half Gross Domestic Product.
However, the latter figures only represent cash remittances processed through Armenian commercial banks.
According to RFE/RL, comparable sums are believed to be transferred through non-bank systems, implying that cash remittances make up approximately 30 percent of Armenia's GDP in the first half of 2008.
In 2007, cash remittances through bank transfers rose by 37 percent to a record-high level of $1.32 billion USD.
According to the Central Bank of Armenia, in 2005, cash remittances from Armenians working abroad reached a record-high level of $1 billion, which is worth more than one fifth of the country’s 2005 Gross Domestic Product.
Net private transfers decreased in 2009, but saw a continuous increase during the first six months of 2010.
Since private transfers from the Diaspora tend to be mostly injected into consumption of imports and not in high value-added sectors, the transfers have not resulted in sizeable increases in productivity.
Secondary sector.
Armenia experienced a construction boom during the latter part of the 2000s.
According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's booming construction sector generated about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP during the first eight months of 2007.
According to a World Bank official, 30 percent of Armenia's economy in 2009 came from the construction sector.
However, during the January to September 2010 period, the sector experienced a 5.2 percent year-on-year decrease, which according to the Civilitas Foundation is an indication of the unsustainability of a sector based on an elite market, with few products for the median or low budgets.
This decrease comes despite the fact that an important component of the government stimulus package was to support the completion of ongoing construction projects.
Retail trade.
In 2010, retail trade turnover was largely unaltered compared to 2009.
The existing monopolies throughout the retail sector have made the sector non-responsive to the crisis and resulted in near zero growth.
The aftermath of the crisis has started to shift the structure in the retail sector in favor of food products.
Services sector.
In the 2000s, along with the construction sector, the services sector was the driving force behind Armenia's recent high economic growth rate.
In 2010, the volume of services increased as much as 7.4 percent from January to September, over the same period in 2009.
Tourism.
According to official data, in 2007, a record-high 500,000 tourists visited Armenia — most of them ethnic Armenians from Europe, Russia and the United States.
2010 saw a noticeable increase in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Armenia – estimated to be 80,000.
However, according to private tour operators and other individuals familiar with the country’s tourism industry, government claims that hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Armenia each year are inflated.
Official statistics show that as many 575,000 tourists visited Armenia from abroad in 2009; the government stated earlier in 2010 that the figure will surpass 620,000 in 2010.
However, data from the National Statistical Service shows that there were only 65,000 foreigners staying in Armenian hotels in 2009.
 <START:person> Ara Vartanian <END> , the chairman of the Armenian Trade and Industry Chamber, thinks that this measure is a far more objective indicator of the tourist influx into the country.
In 2012, as many as 843'330 tourists visited Armenia.
Industrial sector.
Industrial output was relatively positive throughout 2010, with year-on-year average growth of 10.9 percent in the period January to September 2010, due largely to the mining sector where higher global demand for commodities led to higher prices.
According to the National Statistical Service, during the January–August 2007 period, Armenia's industrial sector was the single largest contributor to the country's GDP, but remained largely stagnant with industrial output increasing only by 1.7 percent per year.
In 2005, Armenia's industrial output (including electricity) made up about 30 percent of GDP.
Mining.
40 percent of Armenia's exports in 2009 were mining exports.
Agricultural sector.
As of 2010, the agricultural production comprises on average 25 percent of Armenia's GDP.
In 2006, the agricultural sector accounted for about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP.
Armenia's agricultural output dropped by 17.9 percent in the period of January–September 2010.
This was owing to bad weather, a lack of a government stimulus package, and the continuing effects of decreased agricultural subsidies by the Armenian government (per WTO requirements).
Foreign aid.
United States.
The Armenian government receives foreign aid from the government of the United States through the United States Agency for International Development and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.
On March 27, 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $235.65 million compact with the Government of Armenia.
The single stated goal of the "Armenian Compact" is "the reduction of rural poverty through a sustainable increase in the economic performance of the agricultural sector."
The compact includes a $67 million to rehabilitate up to 943 kilometers of rural roads, more than a third of Armenia's proposed "Lifeline road network".
The Compact also includes a $146 million project to increase the productivity of approximately 250,000 farm households through improved water supply, higher yields, higher-value crops, and a more competitive agricultural sector.
In 2010, the volume of US assistance to Armenia remained near 2009 levels; however, longer-term decline continued.
The original Millennium Challenge Account commitment for $235 million had been reduced to about $175 million due to Armenia’s poor governance record.
Thus, the MCC would not complete road construction.
Instead, the irrigated agriculture project was headed for completion with apparently no prospects for extension beyond 2011.
European Union.
With curtailment of the MCC funding, the European Union may replace the US as Armenia’s chief source of foreign aid for the first time since independence.
From 2011 to 2013, the European Union is expected to advance at least €157.3 million ($208 million) in aid to Armenia.
External trade.
Exports.
In 2010, Armenia’s exports remained resource-dependent, largely because the non-resource-intensive sectors were significantly less competitive.
Armenia has not succeeded in increasing and diversifying exports beyond raw materials thus leaving room for a greater vulnerability to external shocks.
There was a 43.9 percent increase in overall exports during the January to September period.
The main three export destinations were Bulgaria with 15.2 percent of total exports, followed by Germany with 14.2 percent and Russia with 13.9 percent.
Raw minerals were the main export sent to Bulgaria and Germany.
Imports.
The global economic crisis has had less impact on imports because the sector is more diversified than exports.
In the first nine months of 2010, imports grew about 19 percent, just about equal to the decline of the same sector in 2009.
Deficit.
During the first half of 2008, Armenia's widening current-account trade deficit grew by 66 percent to $1.39 billion USD, with a 40 percent rise in imports.
Furthermore, Armenian exports fell by about one percent to $520 million USD.
According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's trade deficit in 2006 was $1.2 billion with growth in exports being largely flat.
During the first 11 months of 2006, net imports grew by 21 percent to $1.95 billion, while exports stood at $895 million, up 0.3 percent from the same period in 2005.
Partners.
European Union.
In 2010, EU countries accounted for 32.1 percent of Armenia’s foreign trade.
Germany is Armenia’s largest trading partner among EU member states, accounting for 7.2 percent of trade; this is due largely to mining exports.
Armenian exports to EU countries have skyrocketed by 65.9 percent, making up more than half of all 2010 January to September exports.
Imports from EU countries increased by 17.1 percent, constituting 22.5 percent of all imports.
During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with the European Union totaled $200 million.
During the first 11 months of 2006, the European Union remained Armenia's largest trading partner, accounting for 34.4 percent of its $2.85 billion commercial exchange during the 11-month period.
Russia and former Soviet republics.
Bilateral trade with Russia stood at more than $700 million for the first nine months of 2010 – on track to rebound to $1 billion mark first reached in 2008 prior to the global economic crisis.
During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with Russia and other former Soviet republics was $205.6 million (double the amount from the same period the previous year), making them the country’s number one trading partner.
During the first 11 months of 2006, the volume of Armenia’s trade with Russia was $376.8 million or 13.2 percent of the total commercial exchange.
China.
As of early 2011, trade with China is dominated by imports of Chinese goods and accounts for about 10 percent of Armenia's foreign trade.
The volume of Chinese-Armenian trade soared by 55 percent to $390 million in January–November 2010.
Armenian exports to China, though still modest in absolute terms, nearly doubled in that period.
Iran.
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Iran was $200 million which is approximately equal to the trade between Armenia and Turkey.
The number of Iranian tourists has risen in recent years, with an estimated 80,000 Iranian tourists in 2010.
Turkey.
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Turkey was about $200 million, with trade taking place without open borders, across Georgian territory.
This figure is not expected to increase significantly so long as the land border between the Armenia and Turkey remains closed.
United States.
From January–September 2010, bilateral trade with the United States measured approximately $150 million, on track for about a 30 percent increase over 2009.
An increase in Armenia’s exports to the US in 2009 and 2010 has been due to shipments of aluminum foil.
During the first 11 months of 2006, U.S.-Armenian trade totaled $152.6 million.
Georgia.
The volume of Georgian-Armenian trade remains modest in both relative and absolute terms.
According to official Armenian statistics, it rose by 11 percent to $91.6 million in January–November 2010.
The figure was equivalent to just over 2 percent of Armenia’s overall foreign trade.
Foreign debt.
Armenia's national debt has increased significantly since 2008 when public external debt consisted of only 13.5 percent of GDP.
By the end of 2010, Armenia’s external debt is projected to form about 42 percent of GDP, and 50 percent in 2012.
As of late November 2009, the Armenian government's foreign debt was around $3 billion USD, having doubled in size over the course of the previous year.
With the Armenian government needing more anti-crisis loans from the World Bank and other foreign donors, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to exceed 40 percent in 2010.
According to a World Bank official, a country that has around 12 percent rate of growth or even lower, at the range of 7 to 8 percent, can afford a level of public debt of up to 50 percent.
The official warned that the debt servicing payments of the Armenian government will surge by 2013 and absorb "quite significant part of tax revenues."
According to another estimate, the ratio between the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the state's foreign debt has reached 46 percent.
Economists generally agree that a country is insolvent, if its foreign debt surpasses 50 percent of its GDP.
Critics of the government say that the $500 million credit from Russia should have gone to develop industry, instead of going to the construction sector.
Transportation routes and energy lines.
Internal.
Since early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway.
Through Georgia.
Russian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.
The only operational rail link into Armenia is from Georgia.
During Soviet times, Armenia's rail network connected to Russia's via Georgia through Abkhazia along the Black Sea.
However, the rail link between Abkhazia and Georgia proper has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports.
The Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi and  <START:person> Poti <END>  process more than 90 percent of freight shipped to and from landlocked Armenia.
The Georgian railway, which runs through the town of Gori in central Georgia, is the main transport link between Armenia and the aforementioned Georgian seaports.
Fuel, wheat and other basic commodities are transported to Armenia by rail.
Armenia's main rail and road border-crossing with Georgia (at ) is along the Debed river near the Armenian town of Bagratashen and the Georgian town of Sadakhlo.
The Upper Lars border crossing (at Darial Gorge) between Georgia and Russia across the Caucasus Mountains served as Armenia's sole overland route to the former Soviet Union and Europe.
It was controversially shut down by the Russian authorities in June 2006, at the height of a Russian-Georgian spy scandal.
Upper  <START:person> Lars <END>  is the only land border crossing that does not go through Georgia's Russian-backed breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The other two roads linking Georgia and Russia run through South Ossetia and Abkhazia, effectively barring them to international traffic.
This crossing is expected to reopen starting on March 1, 2010.
Through Turkey and Azerbaijan.
An economic blockade with Turkey and Azerbaijan has cut Armenia's rail link between  <START:person> Gyumri <END>  and Kars to Turkey; the rail link with Iran through the Azeri exclave of Nakhichevan; and a natural gas and oil pipeline line with Azerbaijan.
Also non-functioning are roads with Turkey and Azerbaijan.
Despite the economic blockade of Turkey on Armenia, every day dozens of Turkish trucks laden with goods enter Armenia through Georgia.
In 2010, it was confirmed that Turkey will keep the border closed for the foreseeable future after the Turkey-Armenia normalization process collapsed.
Through Iran.
A new gas pipeline to Iran has been completed, and a road to Iran through the southern city of Meghri allows trade with that country.
An oil pipeline to pump Iranian oil products is also in the planning stages.
As of October 2008, the Armenian government is considering implementing an ambitious project to build a railway to Iran.
The 400 kilometer railway would pass through Armenia's mountainous southern province of Syunik, which borders Iran.
Economic analysts say that the project would cost at least $1 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of Armenia's 2008 state budget).
As of 2010, the project has been continuously delayed, with the rail link estimated to cost as much as $4 billion and stretch 313 km.
In June 2010, Transport Minister  <START:person> Manuk Vartanian <END>  revealed that Yerevan is seeking as much as $1 billion in loans from China to finance the railway’s construction.
Labor.
Monthly wages.
According to the state-owned Armenpress news agency, the average monthly wage in Armenia for the first half of 2007 was 70,700 drams (about $210 USD).
As of April 24, 2008, the average monthly salary is 75,000 drams (about $242 US dollars).
According to the ROA National Statistical Service, the average monthly salary during January June 2008 is 86,850 drams (about $287 at the time).
About 62% of officially registered wage earners earn at least the average monthly wage, while only 19.6% receive a monthly salary of over 100,000 drams (about $330 at the time).
Unemployment.
According to research commissioned by the Yerevan office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), at least one in three working-age Armenians was unemployed as of February 2005 despite several consecutive years of double-digit economic growth.
The finding sharply contrasts with government's official unemployment rate of about 10 percent.
A 2003 household survey conducted by the National Statistical Survey found that the real unemployment rate is about 33 percent.
Migrant workers.
Since gaining independence in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Armenia's residents have gone abroad, mainly to Russia, in search of work.
Unemployment has been the major cause of this massive labor emigration.
OSCE experts estimate that between 116,000 and 147,000 people left Armenia for economic reasons between 2002 and 2004, with two-thirds of them returning home by February 2005.
According to estimates by the National Statistical Survey, the rate of labor emigration was twice as higher in 2001 and 2002.
According to an OSCE survey, a typical Armenian migrant worker is a married man aged between 41 and 50 years who "began looking for work abroad at the age of 32-33."
Appreciation and depreciation of the dram.
In 2010, the value of the Armenian Dram (AMD) was artificially kept high during the height of the global economic crisis.
Had the AMD been allowed to depreciate to its market level, exports would have become more competitive and the purchasing power of the majority of the population who are dependent on remittances from abroad would have increased.
Instead, the value of the AMD was kept high, out of a fear of inflation and concern about alienating the powerful government-connected importers of oil, sugar, flour, cigarettes and beverages.
The AMD/USD exchange rate depreciated by 6.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, before it began to show the expected end-of-the-year appreciation.
In comparison between the January to October periods of 2010 and 2009, depreciation stands at 4.7 percent.
Government revenue and taxation.
The Armenian government collected 383.5 billion drams ($1.26 billion) in various taxes in the first nine months of 2008 (a 33.2 percent increase from the same period last year).
Many large companies have a privileged status when it comes to taxation.
Big business is not taxed in proportion to its capacity and output, and the disproportionate burden falls on small and medium size businesses.
New value-added tax.
Over half of the tax revenues in the January–August 2008 time period were generated from value-added taxes (VAT).
By comparison, corporate profit tax generated less than 16 percent of the revenues.
This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens, rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenia's double-digit economic growth in recent years).
Tax evasion.
Many Armenian companies, especially those owned by government-connected tycoons, have long reported suspiciously low earnings, thereby avoiding paying larger taxes.
Environmental issues.
Armenia is trying to "address its environmental problems".
It has established a Ministry of Environment and has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal.The resulting revenues are used for unknown purposes.
Armenia doesn't seem to be interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (a group of 12 former Soviet republics) or with members of the international community on environmental issues.
The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant and has already made an agreement with Russian "businessmen" about the construction and operation and ownage of a new Nuclear power plant.
Banking.
Armenia's financial system is not integrated into the global network.
According to the head of the Armenian Central Bank’s (CBA) department for financial system policies and analyses ( <START:person> Vahe Vardanyan <END> ) Armenian banks have no large asset concentrations in foreign markets, particularly in capital markets.
They nearly have no purchased securities (so-called securitized packages).
For this reason, Armenia was virtually unaffected by the Liquidity crisis of September 2008.
Armenian banking assets are very low and make up only 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Takeover of Armenian industrial property by the Russian state and Russian companies.
Since 2000, the Russian state has acquired several key assets in the energy sector and Soviet-era industrial plants.
Property-for-debt or equity-for-debt swaps (acquiring ownership by simply writing off the Armenian government's debts to Russia) are usually the method of acquiring assets.
The failure of market reforms, clan-based economics, and official corruption in Armenia have allowed the success of this process.
In August 2002, the Armenian government sold an 80 percent stake in the Armenian Electricity Network (AEN) to Midland Resources, a British offshore-registered firm which is said to have close Russian connections.
In September 2002, the Armenian government handed over Armenia’s largest cement factory to the Russian ITERA gas exporter in payment for its $10 million debt for past gas deliveries.
On November 5, 2002, Armenia transferred control of 5 state enterprises to Russia in an assets-for-debts transaction which settled $100 million of Armenian state debts to Russia.
The document was signed for Russia by Prime Minister  <START:person> Mikhail Kasyanov <END>  and Industry Minister  <START:person> Ilya Klebanov <END> , while Prime Minister  <START:person> Andranik Markarian <END>  and National Security Council Secretary  <START:person> Serge Sarkisian <END>  signed for Armenia.
The five enterprises which passed to 100 percent Russian state ownership are: In January 2003, the Armenian government and United Company RUSAL signed an investment cooperation agreement, under which United Company RUSAL (which already owned a 76% stake) acquired the Armenian government's remaining 26% share of RUSAL ARMENAL aluminum foil mill, giving RUSAL 100% ownership of RUSAL ARMENAL.
On November 1, 2006, the Armenian government handed de facto control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline to Russian company Gazprom and increased Gazprom's stake in the Russian-Armenian company ArmRosGazprom from 45% to 58% by approving an additional issue of shares worth $119 million.
This left the Armenian government with a 32% stake in ArmRosGazprom.
The transaction will also help finance ArmRosGazprom's acquisition of the Hrazdan electricity generating plant’s fifth power bloc (Hrazdan-5), the leading unit in the country.
In October 2008 the Russian bank Gazprombank, the banking arm of Gazprom, acquired 100 percent of Armenian bank Areximbank after previously buying 80 percent of said bank in November 2007 and 94.15 percent in July of the same year.
Controversy over non-transparent deals.
Critics of the  <START:person> Kocharian <END>  government say that the Armenian administration never considered alternative ways of settling the Russian debts.
According to economist  <START:person> Eduard Aghajanov <END> , Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million.
Furthermore,  <START:person> Aghajanov <END>  points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector – abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.
Political observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government’s work.
The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and now President)  <START:person> Serge Sarkisian <END> ,  <START:person> Kocharian <END> ’s closest political associate.
Other top government officials, including Prime Minister  <START:person> Andranik Markarian <END> , had little say on the issue.
Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after  <START:person> Sarkisian <END> ’s frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.
Finally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multimillion-dollar debts to Russia over the past decade, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia.
For example, pro-Western Ukraine and Georgia (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.

It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the Coen Brothers and  <START:person> Robert Rodriguez <END>  have both directed and edited nearly all of their films.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.
The film, which also starred cabaret singer  <START:person> Astrid Hadad <END>  and model/actress  <START:person> Claudia Ramírez <END>  (with whom  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico.
After this success, director  <START:person> Sydney Pollack <END>  hired  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  to direct an episode of "Fallen Angels", a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included  <START:person> Steven Soderbergh <END> ,  <START:person> Jonathan Kaplan <END> ,  <START:person> Peter Bogdanovich <END>  and  <START:person> Tom Hanks <END> .
International success.
In 1995,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  released his first feature film produced in the United States, "A Little Princess", an adaptation of  <START:person> Frances Hodgson Burnett <END> 's classic novel.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of  <START:person> Charles Dickens <END> 's "Great Expectations" starring  <START:person> Ethan Hawke <END> , Gwyneth Paltrow and  <START:person> Robert De Niro <END> .
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film "Y Tu Mamá También", starring  <START:person> Gael García Bernal <END> ,  <START:person> Diego Luna <END>  and  <START:person> Maribel Verdú <END> .
It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman in her late twenties.
The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  shared an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay with co-writer and brother  <START:person> Carlos Cuarón <END> .
In 2003,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  directed the third film in the successful "Harry Potter" series, " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  faced criticism from some of the more purist " <START:person> Harry Potter <END> " fans for his approach to the film.
At the time of the movie's release, however, author  <START:person> J. K. Rowling <END> , who had seen and loved  <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's film "Y Tu Mamá También", said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.
Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking that it was the first "Harry Potter" film to truly capture the essence of the novels.
It remained as the most critically acclaimed film of the "Harry Potter" film franchise until the release of " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END> 's feature "Children of Men", an adaptation of the  <START:person> P. D. James <END>  novel starring  <START:person> Clive Owen <END> ,  <START:person> Julianne Moore <END>  and  <START:person> Michael Caine <END> , received wide critical acclaim, including three Academy Award nominations.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  himself received two nominations for his work on the film in Best Film Editing (with  <START:person> Alex Rodríguez <END> ) and Best Adapted Screenplay (with several collaborators).
He created the production and distribution company Esperanto Filmoj ("Esperanto Films", named because of his support for the international language Esperanto), which has credits in the films "Duck Season", "Pan's Labyrinth", and "Gravity".
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  also directed the controversial public service announcement "I Am Autism" for Autism Speaks that was sharply criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.
In 2010,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  began to develop the film "Gravity", a drama set in space.
He was joined by producer  <START:person> David Heyman <END> , with whom  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  worked on " <START:person> Harry Potter <END>  and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
Starring  <START:person> Sandra Bullock <END>  and  <START:person> George Clooney <END> , the film was released in the fall of 2013 and opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival in August.
The film received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Directing.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  won for Best Directing, becoming the first Latin American to win the award, while he and  <START:person> Mark Sanger <END>  shared the award for Best Film Editing.
In 2013,  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  created "Believe", a science fiction/fantasy/adventure series that is being broadcast as part of the 2013–14 United States network television schedule on NBC as a mid-season entry.
The series was created by Cuarón for Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television.
In 2014, "TIME" placed him in its list of "100 Most Influential People in the World" Pioneers.
In May 2015  <START:person> Cuarón <END>  was announced as the President of the Jury for the 72nd Venice International Film Festival.
Personal life.
 <START:person> Cuarón <END>  has been living in London since 2000.
He was married to Italian actress and freelance journalist  <START:person> Annalisa Bugliani <END>  from 2001 to 2008.
They have two children: daughter  <START:person> Tess Bu Cuarón <END>  (born 2003) and son  <START:person> Olmo Teodoro Cuarón <END>  (born 2005).
Anisotropy  Anisotropy is the property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to isotropy, which implies identical properties in all directions.
It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc.)
An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a polarizer.
Another is wood, which is easier to split along its grain than against it.
Fields of interest.
Computer graphics.
In the field of computer graphics, an anisotropic surface changes in appearance as it rotates about its geometric normal, as is the case with velvet.
Anisotropic filtering (AF) is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view.
Older techniques, such as bilinear and trilinear filtering, do not take into account the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in aliasing or blurring of textures.
By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.
Chemistry.
A chemical anisotropic filter, as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the proximal regions filter out larger particles and distal regions increasingly remove smaller particles, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.
In NMR spectroscopy, the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their chemical shift.
In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of benzene.
This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.
In fluorescence spectroscopy, the fluorescence anisotropy, calculated from the polarization properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane-polarized light, is used, e.g., to determine the shape of a macromolecule.
Anisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon.
Real-world imagery.
Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).
Physics.
Physicists from University of California, Berkeley reported about their detection of the cosine anisotropy in cosmic microwave background radiation in 1977.
Their experiment demonstrated the Doppler shift caused by the movement of the earth with respect to the early Universe matter, the source of the radiation.
Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies' rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.
Physicists use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials.
Magnetic anisotropy, for example, may occur in a plasma, so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction.
Plasmas may also show "filamentation" (such as that seen in lightning or a plasma globe) that is directional.
An "anisotropic liquid" has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or chloroform, which contain no structural ordering of the molecules.
Liquid crystals are examples of anisotropic liquids.
Some materials conduct heat in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source.
Heat conduction is more commonly anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required.
The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in electronics are often anisotropic.
Many crystals are anisotropic to light ("optical anisotropy"), and exhibit properties such as birefringence.
Crystal optics describes light propagation in these media.
An "axis of anisotropy" is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken (or an axis of symmetry, such as normal to crystalline layers).
Some materials can have multiple such optical axes.
Geology and geophysics.
Seismic anisotropy is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction.
Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic wavelength (e.g., crystals, cracks, pores, layers or inclusions) have a dominant alignment.
This alignment leads to a directional variation of elasticity wavespeed.
Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's crust, mantle and inner core.
Geological formations with distinct layers of sedimentary material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; electrical conductivity in one direction (e.g.
parallel to a layer), is different from that in another (e.g.
perpendicular to a layer).
This property is used in the gas and oil exploration industry to identify hydrocarbon-bearing sands in sequences of sand and shale.
Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high resistivity (low conductivity), whereas shales have lower resistivity.
Formation evaluation instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas in wells.
The hydraulic conductivity of aquifers is often anisotropic for the same reason.
When calculating groundwater flow to drains or to wells, the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability must be taken into account, otherwise the results may be subject to error.
Most common rock-forming minerals are anisotropic, including quartz and feldspar.
Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their optical properties.
An example of an isotropic mineral is garnet.
Medical acoustics.
Anisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting echogenicity of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed.
Tendon fibers appear hyperechoic (bright) when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon, but can appear hypoechoic (darker) when the transducer is angled obliquely.
This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners.
Material science and engineering.
Anisotropy, in Material Science, is a material’s directional dependence of a physical property.
Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior.
An example would be the dependence of  <START:person> Young <END> 's modulus on the direction of load.
Anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can also be due to certain texture patterns often produced during manufacturing of the material.
In the case of rolling, "stringers" of texture are produced in the direction of rolling, which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions.
Some materials, such as wood and fibre-reinforced composites are very anisotropic, being much stronger along the grain/fibre than across it.
Metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic, though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour.
This is especially important in processes such as deep-drawing.
Wood is a naturally anisotropic (transversely isotropic) material.
Its properties vary widely when measured with or against the growth grain.
For example, wood's strength and hardness is different for the same sample measured in different orientations.
Microfabrication.
Anisotropic etching techniques (such as deep reactive ion etching) are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high aspect ratio.
These features are commonly used in MEMS and microfluidic devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device.
Anisotropic etching can also refer to certain chemical etchants used to etch a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes (e.g., KOH etching of silicon [100] produces pyramid-like structures) Neuroscience.
Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that involves measuring the fractional anisotropy of the random motion (Brownian motion) of water molecules in the brain.
Water molecules located in fiber tracts are more likely to be anisotropic, since they are restricted in their movement (they move more in the dimension parallel to the fiber tract rather than in the two dimensions orthogonal to it), whereas water molecules dispersed in the rest of the brain have less restricted movement and therefore display more isotropy.
This difference in fractional anisotropy is exploited to create a map of the fiber tracts in the brains of the individual.
Atmospheric Radiative Transfer.
Radiance fields (see BRDF) from a reflective surface are often not isotropic in nature.
This makes calculations of the total energy being reflected from any scene a difficult quantity to calculate.
In remote sensing applications, anisotropy functions can be derived for specific scenes, immensely simplifying the calculation of the net reflectance or (thereby) the net irradiance of a scene.
For example, let the BRDF be formula_1 where 'i' denotes incident direction and 'v' denotes viewing direction (as if from a satellite or other instrument).
And let P be the Planar Albedo, which represents the total reflectance from the scene.
It is of interest because, with knowledge of the anisotropy function as defined, a measurement of the BRDF from a single viewing direction (say, formula_4) yields a measure of the total scene reflectance ( <START:person> Planar Albedo <END> ) for that specific incident geometry (say,formula_5).
Abalone  Abalone ( or ; via Spanish "abulón", from the Rumsen language "aulón") is a common name for any of a group of small to very large edible sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Haliotidae.
Other common names are ear shells, sea ears, and muttonfish or muttonshells in Australia, ormer in Great Britain, and pāua in New Zealand.
The family Haliotidae contains only one genus, "Haliotis", which used to contain 6 subgenera.
These subgenera have become alternate representations of "Haliotis".
The number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30 and 130 with over 230 species-level taxa described.
The most comprehensive treatment of the family considers 56 species valid, with 18 additional subspecies.
The shells of abalones have a low open spiral structure, and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shell's outer edge.
The thick inner layer of the shell is composed of nacre (mother-of-pearl), which in many species is highly iridescent, giving rise to a range of strong changeable colors, which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects, jewelry, and as a source of colorful mother-of-pearl.
The flesh of abalones is widely considered to be a desirable food, and is consumed raw or cooked in a variety of cultures.
Description.
The shell of abalones is convex, rounded to oval shape, and may be highly arched or very flattened.
The shell of the majority of species is ear-shaped, presenting a small flat spire and two to three whorls.
The last whorl, known as the body whorl, is auriform, meaning that the shell resembles an ear, giving rise to the common name "ear shell".
"Haliotis asinina" has a somewhat different shape, as it is more elongated and distended.
The shell of "Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii" is also unusual as it has an ovate form, is imperforate, shows an exserted spire, and has prickly ribs.
A mantle cleft in the shell impresses a groove in the shell, in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus.
These holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column.
They make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows.
This series of 8 to 38 holes is near the anterior margin.
Only a small number are generally open.
The older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form.
Each species has a typical number of open holes, between four and ten, in the selenizone.
Abalone have no operculum.
The aperture of the shell is very wide and nacreous.
The exterior of the shell is striated and dull.
The color of the shell is very variable from species to species which may reflect the animal's diet.
The iridescent nacre that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white, to pink, red and green-red to deep blue, green to purple.
The animal shows fimbriated head-lobes.
The side-lobes are also fimbriated and cirrated.
The rounded foot is very large.
The radula has small median teeth, and the lateral teeth are single and beam-like.
There are about 70 uncini, with denticulated hooks, the first four very large.
The soft body is coiled around the columellar muscle, and its insertion, instead of being on the columella, is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell.
The gills are symmetrical and both well developed.
These snails cling solidly with their broad muscular foot to rocky surfaces at sublittoral depths, although some species such as "Haliotis cracherodii" used to be common in the intertidal zone.
Abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size.
Their fecundity is high and increases with their size (from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time).
The spermatozoa are filiform and pointed at one end, and the anterior end is a rounded head.
The larvae are lecithotrophic.
The adults are herbivorous and feed with their rhipidoglossan radula on macroalgae, preferring red or brown algae.
Sizes vary from 20 mm ("Haliotis pulcherrima") to 200 mm while "Haliotis rufescens" is the largest of the genus at 12 in.
Abalones are herbivorous on hard substrata.
By weight, approximately 1/3 of the animal is edible meat, 1/3 is offal, and 1/3 is shell.
Distribution.
The haliotid family has a worldwide distribution, along the coastal waters of every continent, except the Pacific coast of South America, the East Coast of the United States, the Arctic, and Antarctica The majority of abalone species are found in cold waters, such as off the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Western North America, and Japan.
Structure and properties of the shell.
The shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic calcium carbonate tiles stacked like bricks.
Between the layers of tiles is a clingy protein substance.
When the abalone shell is struck, the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow.
Material scientists around the world are studying this tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as body armor.
The dust created by grinding and cutting abalone shell is dangerous; appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles.
Diseases and pests.
Abalones are subject to various diseases.
The Victorian Department of Primary Industries said in 2007 that ganglioneuritis, or AVG, killed up to 90% of stock in affected regions.
Abalone are also severe hemophiliacs as their fluids will not clot in the case of a laceration or puncture wound.
Members of the Spionidae family of the polychaetes are known as pests of abalone.
Human use.
The meat (foot muscle) of abalone is used for food, and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as a source of mother of pearl for jewelry, buttons, buckles, and inlay.
Abalone shells have been found in archaeological sites around the world, ranging from 75,000 year old deposits at Blombos Cave in South Africa to historic Chinese abalone middens on California's Northern Channel Islands.
On the Channel Islands, where abalones were harvested by Native Americans for at least 12,000 years, the size of red abalone shells found in middens declines significantly after about 4000 years ago, probably due to human predation.
Worldwide, abalone pearls have also been collected for centuries.
Farming.
Farming of abalone began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Japan and China.
Since the mid-1990s, there have been many increasingly successful endeavors to commercially farm abalone for the purpose of consumption.
Over-fishing and poaching have reduced wild populations to such an extent that farmed abalone now supplies most of the abalone meat consumed.
The principal abalone farming regions are China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea.
Abalone is also farmed in Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States.
Consumption.
Abalone have long been a valuable food source for humans in every area of the world where a species is abundant.
The meat of this mollusc is considered a delicacy in certain parts of Latin America (especially Chile), France, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and East Asia (especially in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea).
In Chinese speaking regions, abalone are commonly known as bao yu, and sometimes form part of a Chinese banquet .
In the same way as shark fin soup or bird's nest soup, abalone is considered a luxury item, and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations .
However, the availability of commercially farmed abalone has allowed more common consumption of this once rare delicacy .
Abalone started to become popular after the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1915.
As Abalone became more popular and less common, the prices have adjusted accordingly.
In the 1920s a restaurant served portion of abalone, about 4 ounces, would cost (in inflation adjusted dollars) about $7, by 2004, the price had skyrocketed to $75.
In America, prior to this time, abalone was predominantly eaten, gathered, and prepared, by Chinese immigrants.
By 1900, laws were passed in California to outlaw the taking of abalone above the intertidal zone.
This forced the Chinese out of the market and the Japanese perfected diving, with or without gear, to enter the market.
By the time of the exposition, Americans were starting to discover abalone.
The popularity of abalone, along with many other fish and shellfish, increased as the expo exhibited 365 varieties of fish with cooking demonstrations, and a 1300-seat dining hall.
In Japan, live and raw abalone are used in awabi sushi, or served steamed, salted, boiled, chopped, or simmered in soy sauce.
Salted, fermented abalone entrails are the main component of tottsuru, a local dish from Honshū.
Tottsuru is mainly enjoyed with sake.
In California, abalone meat can be found on pizza, sautéed with caramelized mango or in steak form dusted with cracker meal and flour.
Sport harvesting.
Australia.
Tasmania supplies approximately 25% of the yearly world abalone harvest.
Around 12,500 Tasmanians recreationally fish for blacklip and greenlip abalone.
For blacklip abalone, the size limit varies from between 138 mm for the southern end of the state and 127 mm for the northern end of the state.
Greenlip abalone have a minimum size of 145 mm, except for an area around  <START:person> Perkin <END> 's Bay in the north of the state where the minimum size is 132 mm.
With a recreational abalone licence, there is a bag limit of 10 per day, and a total possession limit of 20.
Scuba diving for abalone is allowed, and has a rich history in Australia.
(Scuba diving for abalone in the states of New South Wales and Western Australia is illegal; a free-diving catch limit of two is allowed).
 <START:person> Victoria <END>  has had an active abalone fishery since the late 1950s.
The state is sectioned into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western with each fisher required a zone allocated licence.
Harvesting is performed by divers using surface supplied air "hookah" systems operating from runabout style, outboard powered boats.
While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds the deckhand operates the boat, known as working "live" and stays above where the diver is working.
Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of "shot line", where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved.
Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand re-measures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell.
Since 2002 the Victorian Industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch (TAC) reduced from 1440 tonnes to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 fishing year.
This is due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus Ganglioneuritis which is fast spreading and lethal to abalone stocks.
United States.
Sport harvesting of red abalone is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card.
In 2008, the abalone card also came with a set of 24 tags.
This was reduced to 18 abalone per year in 2014, only nine of which may be taken south of Mendocino County.
Legal-size abalone must be tagged immediately.
Abalone may only be taken using breath-hold techniques or shorepicking; scuba diving for abalone is strictly prohibited.
Taking of abalone is not permitted south of the mouth of the San Francisco Bay.
There is a size minimum of 7 in measured across the shell.
A person may be in possession of only three abalone at any given time.
Abalone may only be taken from April to November, not including July.
Transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still attached in the shell.
Sale of sport-obtained abalone is illegal, including the shell.
Only red abalone may be taken as black, white, pink, flat, green, and pinto abalone are protected by law.
An abalone diver is normally equipped with a thick wetsuit, including a hood, bootees, and gloves, and usually also a mask, snorkel, weight belt, abalone iron, and abalone gauge.
Alternatively, the rock picker can feel underneath rocks at low tides for abalone.
Abalone are mostly taken in depths from a few inches up to 10 m; less common are freedivers who can work deeper than 10 m.
Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources such as kelp.
An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it can fully clamp down.
Divers dive out of boats, kayaks, tube floats or directly off the shore.
The largest abalone recorded in California is 12.34 in, caught by  <START:person> John Pepper <END>  somewhere off the coast of San Mateo county in September 1993.
The mollusc "Concholepas concholepas" is often sold in the United States under the name "Chilean abalone", though it is not an abalone, but a muricid.
New Zealand.
In New Zealand, abalone is called pāua (, from the Māori language).
"Haliotis iris" (or blackfoot pāua) is the ubiquitous New Zealand pāua; the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue, green, and purple iridescence.
"Haliotis australis" and "Haliotis virginea" are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than "H.
iris".
Like all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of pāua does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) are followed.
The legal recreational daily limit is 10 pāua per diver, with a minimum shell length of 125 mm for "Haliotis iris" and 80 mm for "Haliotis australis".
In addition, no person may be in possession, even on land, of more than 20 pāua or more than 2.5 kg of pāua meat at any one time.
Pāua can only be caught by free-diving; it is illegal to catch pāua using scuba gear.
There is an extensive global black market in collecting and exporting abalone meat.
This can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest pāua can be granted legally under Māori customary rights.
When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police.
The limit is strictly enforced by roving Ministry for Primary Industries fishery officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police.
Pāua poaching is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized.
Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases, imprisonment.
The Ministry of Fisheries expects in the year 2004/05, nearly 1,000 tons of pāua will be poached, with 75% of that being undersized.
South Africa.
The largest abalone in South Africa, "Haliotis midae", occurs along approximately two-thirds of the country’s coastline.
Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting.
In South Africa all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually, and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear.
For the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone, but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by syndicates.
In 2007, because of widespread poaching of abalone, the South African government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the CITES section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species.
This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls.
Export permits are still required, however.
The abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries.
As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram.
There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne.
Channel Islands.
Ormers ("Haliotis tuberculata") are considered a delicacy in the British Channel Islands as well as in adjacent areas of France, and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals.
This has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century, and "ormering" is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks.
The gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from January 1 to April 30, which occur on the full or new moon and two days following.
No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under 80 mm in shell length.
Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater.
Any breach of these laws is a criminal offense and can lead to fine of up to £5,000 or six months in prison.
The demand for ormers is such that they led to the world's first underwater arrest, when Mr.  <START:person> Kempthorne-Leigh <END>  of Guernsey was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear when illegally diving for ormers.
Decorative items.
The highly iridescent inner nacre layer of the shell of abalone has traditionally been used as a decorative item, in jewelry, buttons, and as inlay in furniture and in musical instruments such as guitars, etc. Abalone pearl jewelry is very popular in New Zealand and Australia, in no minor part due to the marketing and farming efforts of pearl companies.
Unlike the Oriental Natural, the Akoya pearl, and the South Sea and Tahitian cultured pearls, abalone pearls are not primarily judged by their roundness.
The inner shell of the abalone is an iridescent swirl of intense colours, ranging from deep cobalt blue and peacock green to purples, creams and pinks.
Therefore each pearl, natural or cultured, will have its own unique collage of colours.
The shells of abalone are occasionally used in New Age smudging ceremonies to catch falling ash.
They have also been used as incense burners.
Threat of extinction.
Abalones have been identified as one of the many classes of organism threatened with extinction due to overfishing, acidification of oceans from anthropogenic carbon dioxide, as reduced pH erodes their shells.
It is predicted that abalones will become extinct in the wild within 200 years at current rates of carbon dioxide production.
Species.
The number of species that are recognized within the genus "Haliotis" has fluctuated over time, and depends on the source that is consulted.
The number of recognized species range from 30 to 130.
This list finds a compromise using the "WoRMS database", plus some species that have been added, for a total of 57.
The majority of abalone have not been rated for conservation status.
Those that have been reviewed tend to show that the abalone in general is an animal that is declining in numbers, and will need protection throughout the globe.

</dl>   <START:person> Ambrose  Aurelius Ambrosius <END> , better known in English as Saint  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  (; c. 340 – 4 April 397), was a bishop of Milan who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century.
He was consular prefect of Liguria and  <START:person> Emilia <END> , headquartered in Milan, before being made bishop of Milan by popular acclamation in 374.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was a staunch opponent of Arianism, and has been accused of fostering persecutions of Arians, Jews, and pagans.
Traditionally,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is credited with promoting "antiphonal chant", a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing "Veni redemptor gentium", a Christmas hymn.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was one of the four original doctors of the Church, and is the patron saint of Milan.
He is notable for his influence on St. Augustine.
Life.
Early life.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was born into a Roman Christian family about 340 AD and was raised in  <START:person> Trier <END> .
His father was  <START:person> Aurelius Ambrosius <END> , the praetorian prefect of  <START:person> Gaul <END> ; his mother was a woman of intellect and piety.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's siblings,  <START:person> Satyrus <END>  (who is the subject of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's "De excessu fratris Satyri") and  <START:person> Marcellina <END> , are also venerated as saints.
There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of bees settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of honey.
His father considered this a sign of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue.
For this reason, bees and beehives often appear in the saint's symbology.
After the early death of his father,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  followed his father's career.
He was educated in Rome, studying literature, law, and rhetoric.
Praetorian prefect  <START:person> Probus <END>  first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him consular prefect or "Governor" of Liguria and  <START:person> Emilia <END> , with headquarters at Milan, which was then (beside Rome) the second capital in Italy.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374 when he became the Bishop of Milan.
He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of the Emperor  <START:person> Valentinian I. Ambrose <END>  never married.
Bishop of Milan.
In the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the diocese of Milan between the Catholics and Arians.
In 374 the bishop of Milan,  <START:person> Auxentius <END> , an  <START:person> Arian <END> , died, and the  <START:person> Arians <END>  challenged the succession.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis.
His address was interrupted by a call "Ambrose, bishop!", which was taken up by the whole assembly.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was known to be Catholic in belief, but also acceptable to  <START:person> Arians <END>  due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard.
At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared:  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was neither baptized nor formally trained in theology.
Upon his appointment,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide.
Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor  <START:person> Gratian <END>  praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions,  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's host gave him up.
Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of Milan.
As bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister  <START:person> Marcellina <END>  (who later became a nun), and committed the care of his family to his brother.
This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also wrote a treatise by the name of "The Goodness of Death".
Arianism.
According to legend,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  immediately and forcefully stopped Arianism in Milan.
He studied theology with Simplician, a presbyter of Rome.
Using his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, to his advantage, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like  <START:person> Philo <END> , Origen,  <START:person> Athanasius <END> , and Basil of Caesarea, with whom he was also exchanging letters.
He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed  <START:person> Augustine of Hippo <END> , who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.
In the confrontation with  <START:person> Arians <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the Nicene creed and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy.
The  <START:person> Arians <END>  appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires.
Although the western Emperor  <START:person> Gratian <END>  supported orthodoxy, the younger  <START:person> Valentinian II <END> , who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  did not sway the young prince's position.
In the East, Emperor  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  I likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy.
In this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops Palladius of Ratiaria and Secundianus of Singidunum, confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire.
This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation.
However,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops.
Accordingly, a synod composed of thirty-two bishops was held at Aquileia in the year 381.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined.
A vote was then taken, when  <START:person> Palladius <END>  and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.
Nevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose.
In 385 or 386 the emperor and his mother  <START:person> Justina <END> , along with a considerable number of clergy and laity, especially military, professed Arianism.
They demanded two churches in Milan, one in the city (the Basilica of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), to the Arians.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.
He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches.
The day following, when he was performing divine service in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs.
As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of Easter.
In spite of Imperial opposition, Bishop  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  declared: If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of  <START:person> Christ <END> .
I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it.
The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but God alone can appease it.
Imperial relations.
The imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> , however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor.
When  <START:person> Magnus Maximus <END>  usurped the supreme power in Gaul, and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.
A second later embassy was unsuccessful.
The enemy entered Italy and Milan was taken.
 <START:person> Justina <END>  and her son fled but  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.
In 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused Valentinian II's imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the use of Arian troops.
In 386  <START:person> Justina <END>  and Valentinian received the  <START:person> Arian <END>  bishop  <START:person> Auxentius <END>  the younger, and  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.
Theodosius I, the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of  <START:person> Justina <END> , and regained the kingdom.
 <START:person> Theodosius <END>  was excommunicated by  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  for the massacre of 7,000 persons at Thessalonica in 390, after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  told  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  to imitate  <START:person> David <END>  in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt —  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also forced Theodosius to retreat from compensating a Jewish community in Mesopotamia when a synagogue was burnt down by militant Christians.
These incidents show the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor — the controversy of  <START:person> John Chrysostom <END>  with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.
In 392, after the death of Valentinian II and the acclamation of  <START:person> Eugenius <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  after  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  was eventually victorious.
Attitude towards Jews.
In his treatise on  <START:person> Abraham <END> ,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  warns against intermarriage with pagans, Jews, or heretics.
In 388, Emperor  <START:person> Theodosius the Great <END>  was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the synagogue at Callinicum on the Euphrates.
He ordered the synagogue rebuilt at the expense of the bishop.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  wrote to him, pointing out that he was thereby "exposing the bishop to the danger of either acting against the truth or of death"; in the letter "the reasons given for the imperial rescript are met, especially by the plea that the Jews had burnt many churches".
In the course of the letter  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  speaks of the clemency that the emperor had shown with regard to the burning of other buildings and then adds: "There is, then, no adequate cause for such a commotion, that the people should be so severely punished for the burning of a building, and much less since it is the burning of a synagogue, a home of unbelief, a house of impiety, a receptacle of folly, which God Himself has condemned.
For thus we read, where the Lord our God speaks by the mouth of the prophet  <START:person> Jeremiah <END> : 'And I will do to this house, which is called by My Name, wherein ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh, and I will cast you forth from My sight, as I cast forth your brethren, the whole seed of  <START:person> Ephraim <END> .
And do not thou pray for that people, and do not thou ask mercy for them, and do not come near Me on their behalf, for I will not hear thee.
Or seest thou not what they do in the cities of  <START:person> Judah <END> ?' God forbids intercession to be made for those."
In his exposition of Psalm 1,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  says: "Virtues without faith are leaves, flourishing in appearance, but unproductive.
How many pagans have mercy and sobriety but no fruit, because they do not attain their purpose!
The leaves speedily fall at the wind's breath.
Some Jews exhibit purity of life and much diligence and love of study, but bear no fruit and live like leaves."
Attitude towards pagans.
Under  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's major influence, emperors Gratian, Valentinian II and Theodosius I carried on a persecution of Paganism.
Under  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's influence,  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  issued the 391 "Theodosian decrees," which with increasing intensity outlawed  <START:person> Pagan <END>  practises, and the Altar of Victory was removed by  <START:person> Gratian <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  prevailed upon Gratian, Valentinian and  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  to reject requests to restore the Altar.
Later years and death.
In April 393  <START:person> Arbogast <END> , "magister militum" of the West and his puppet Emperor  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  marched into Italy to consolidate their position in regard to Theodosius I and his son,  <START:person> Honorius <END> , whom  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  had appointed Augustus to govern the western portion of the empire.
 <START:person> Arbogast <END>  and  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  courted  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's support by very obliging letters; but before they arrived at Milan, he had retired to Bologna, where he assisted at the translation of the relics of SS.
 <START:person> Vitalis <END>  and Agricola.
From there he went to Florence, where he remained until  <START:person> Eugenius <END>  withdrew from Milan to meet Theodosius in the Battle of the Frigidus in early September 394.
Soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the Roman empire,  <START:person> Theodosius <END>  died at Milan in 395, and two years later (April 4, 397)  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  also died.
He was succeeded as bishop of Milan by  <START:person> Simplician <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's body may still be viewed in the church of S. Ambrogio in Milan, where it has been continuously venerated — along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of Sts.
 <START:person> Gervase <END>  and Protase.
Character.
Many circumstances in the history of  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  are characteristic of the general spirit of the times.
The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period.
But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.
He was generous to the poor; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship.
It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two martyrs,  <START:person> Gervasius <END>  and Protasius.
The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died.
The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.
Theology.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  ranks with  <START:person> Augustine <END> ,  <START:person> Jerome <END> , and  <START:person> Gregory the Great <END> , as one of the Latin Doctors of the Church.
Theologians compare him with  <START:person> Hilary <END> , who they claim fell short of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's administrative excellence but demonstrated greater theological ability.
He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of Biblical and doctrinal subjects.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing doctrine of the Church and its sacerdotal ministry, while the prevalent asceticism of the day, continuing the Stoic and Ciceronian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian ethics.
Thus we have the "De officiis ministrorum", "De viduis", "De virginitate" and "De paenitentia".
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place.
His advice to  <START:person> Augustine <END>  of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom.
"When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not.
Follow the custom of the church where you are."
Thus  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the "right" liturgical form where there was no substantial problem.
His advice has remained in the English language as the saying, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
One interpretation of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's writings is that he was a Christian universalist.
It has been noted that  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's theology was significantly influenced by that of Origen and  <START:person> Didymus the Blind <END> , two other early Christian universalists.
One quotation cited in favor of this belief: Our Savior has appointed two kinds of resurrection in the Apocalypse.
'Blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection,' for such come to grace without the judgment.
As for those who do not come to the first, but are reserved unto the second resurrection, these shall be disciplined until their appointed times, between the first and the second resurrection.
One could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream Christian belief in a general resurrection (both for those in heaven and for those in hell).
Several other works by  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation.
For example: The Jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into God, "and therefore have lost the grace of redemption", because they reject that on which salvation depends.
Giving to the poor.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders, but a part of the united, solidary people.
Giving to the poor was not to be considered an act of generosity towards the fringes of society but as a repayment of resources that God had originally bestowed on everyone equally and that the rich had usurped.
Mariology.
The theological treatises of Ambrose of Milan would come to influence  <START:person> Popes Damasus <END> ,  <START:person> Siricius <END>  and  <START:person> Leo XIII <END> .
Central to  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is the virginity of  <START:person> Mary <END>  and her role as  <START:person> Mother of God <END> .
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  viewed virginity as superior to marriage and saw  <START:person> Mary <END>  as the model of virginity.
Writings.
In matters of exegesis he is, like  <START:person> Hilary <END> , an Alexandrian.
In dogma he follows Basil of Caesarea and other Greek authors, but nevertheless gives a distinctly Western cast to the speculations of which he treats.
This is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human sin and divine grace, and in the place which he assigns to faith in the individual Christian life.
Church music.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of Ambrosian chant also known simply as "antiphonal chant", a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other.
(The later pope St.  <START:person> Gregory <END>  I the Great is not known to have composed any Gregorian chant, the plainsong or "Romish chant".)
However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing hymnody from the Eastern Church into the West.
Catching the impulse from  <START:person> Hilary <END>  and confirmed in it by the success of Arian psalmody,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  composed several original hymns as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies.
Each of these hymns has eight four-line stanzas and is written in strict iambic dimeter (that is 2 x 2 iambs).
Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.
In his writings,  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  refers only to the performance of psalms, in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an "antiphon".
 <START:person> St. Ambrose <END>  was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn "Te Deum", which he is said to have composed when he baptised St. Augustine of Hippo, his celebrated convert.
Augustine.
 <START:person> Ambrose <END>  was Bishop of Milan at the time of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's conversion, and is mentioned in  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions".
Celibacy.
In a passage of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions" in which  <START:person> Augustine <END>  wonders why he could not share his burden with  <START:person> Ambrose <END> , he makes a comment which bears on the history of celibacy:  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor.
Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden.
Reading.
In this same passage of  <START:person> Augustine <END> 's "Confessions" is a curious anecdote which bears on the history of reading: When [ <START:person> Ambrose <END> ] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still.
Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud.
This is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion.
The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become.
In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection.
However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual.
In popular culture.
In the 2012 film "", Bishop  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is portrayed by Italian actor  <START:person> Andrea Giordana <END> .
Bibliography.
Latin English translations Several of  <START:person> Ambrose <END> 's works have recently been published in the bilingual Latin-German Fontes Christiani series (currently edited by Brepols).
Several religious brotherhoods which have sprung up in and around Milan at various times since the 14th century have been called Ambrosians.
Their connection to  <START:person> Ambrose <END>  is tenuous  Adiabatic process  An adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or matter between a system and its surroundings.
The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics, and as such it is a key concept in thermodynamics.
Some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the "adiabatic approximation," meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system.
In way of example, the adiabatic flame temperature is an idealization that uses the "adiabatic approximation" so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel.
The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by a flame if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings.
Description.
A process that does not involve the transfer of heat or matter into or out of a system, so that "Q" = 0, is called an adiabatic process, and such a system is said to be adiabatically isolated.
The assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption.
For example, the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process, little of the system's energy can be transferred out as heat.
Even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive, that process is idealized to be adiabatic.
The assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one, and is often combined with others so as to make the calculation of the system's behaviour possible.
Such assumptions are idealizations.
The behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations, but the assumption of such "perfect" behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works.
Various applications of the adiabatic assumption.
Naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).
The transfer of energy as work into an adiabatic (insulated) system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds.
One kind of work is where there is no entropy produced within the system (no friction, viscous dissipation, etc), and the work is only pressure-volume work (denoted by "P" d"V").
In nature, this ideal kind occurs only approximately, because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation.
The other extreme kind of work is isochoric work (), for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system.
A stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid, but that work is not recoverable.
Isochoric work is irreversible.
The second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process of transfer of energy as work, always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work.
Every natural process, adiabatic or not, is irreversible, with Δ"S" > 0, as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent.
Adiabatic heating and cooling.
The adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas.
Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature.
In contrast, free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas.
Adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a piston compressing a gas contained within an adiabatic cylinder.
This finds practical application in Diesel engines which rely on the lack of quick heat dissipation during their compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.
Adiabatic heating occurs in the Earth's atmosphere when an air mass descends, for example, in a katabatic wind, Foehn wind, or chinook wind flowing downhill over a mountain range.
When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases.
Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing the internal energy.
The parcel of air is unable to dissipate energy as heat, hence it is considered adiabatically isolated, and its temperature will rise sensibly.
Adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings.
When the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as internal energy decreases.
Adiabatic cooling occurs in the Earth's atmosphere with orographic lifting and lee waves, and this can form pileus or lenticular clouds.
Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid.
One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is adiabatic demagnetisation, where the change in magnetic field on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling.
Also, the contents of an expanding universe can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid.
"(See Heat death of the universe)" Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as kimberlites.
Such temperature changes can be quantified using the ideal gas law, or the hydrostatic equation for atmospheric processes.
In practice, no process is truly adiabatic.
Many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary, and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption.
There is always some heat loss, as no perfect insulators exist.
Ideal gas (reversible process).
The mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process is where "P" is pressure, "V" is volume, and formula_3 being the specific heat for constant pressure, formula_4 being the specific heat for constant volume, formula_5 is the adiabatic index, and formula_6 is the number of degrees of freedom (3 for monatomic gas, 5 for diatomic gas and collinear molecules e.g.
carbon dioxide).
For a monatomic ideal gas, formula_7, and for a diatomic gas (such as nitrogen and oxygen, the main components of air) formula_8.
Note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not Bose– <START:person> Einstein <END>  or Fermi gases.
For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that where "T" is an absolute temperature.
This can also be written as Example of adiabatic compression.
Let's now look at a common example of adiabatic compression–the compression stroke in a gasoline engine.
We will make a few simplifying assumptions: that the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is 1000 cm3 (one litre), that the gas within is nearly pure nitrogen (thus a diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so formula_12 = 7/5), and that the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1000 cm3 volume of uncompressed gas will compress down to 100 cm3 when the piston goes from bottom to top).
The uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27 ºC or 300 K, and a pressure of 1 bar ~ 100 kPa, or about 14.7 PSI, i.e. typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).
formula_13 so our adiabatic constant for this experiment is about 1.58 billion.
The gas is now compressed to a 100 cm3 volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas).
The new volume is 100 cm3, but the constant for this experiment is still 1.58 billion: formula_14 so solving for P: formula_15 or about 362 PSI or 24.5 atm.
Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas has also heated the gas and the hotter gas will have a greater pressure even if the volume had not changed.
We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law.
Our initial conditions are 100,000 pa of pressure, 1000 cm3 volume, and 300 K of temperature, so our experimental constant is: formula_16 That is a final temperature of 751 K, or 477 °C, or 892 °F, well above the ignition point of many fuels.
This is why a high compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause engine knocking when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a supercharger and intercooler to provide a lower temperature at the same pressure would be advantageous.
A diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas temperature which ensures immediate ignition of injected fuel.
Adiabatic free expansion of a gas.
For an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum.
Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero.
Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero.
For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case.
Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.
Derivation of P-V relation for adiabatic heating and cooling.
The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, formula_17.
Then, according to the first law of thermodynamics, where "dU" is the change in the internal energy of the system and "δW" is work done "by" the system.
Any work ("δW") done must be done at the expense of internal energy "U", since no heat "δQ" is being supplied from the surroundings.
Pressure-volume work "δW" done "by" the system is defined as However, "P" does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with "V".
It is desired to know how the values of "dP" and "dV" relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds.
For an ideal gas the internal energy is given by where formula_21 is the number of degrees of freedom divided by two, "R" is the universal gas constant and "n" is the number of moles in the system (a constant).
Differentiating Equation (3) and use of the ideal gas law, formula_22, yields Equation (4) is often expressed as formula_24 because formula_25.
Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtain factorize :formula_27: and divide both sides by "PV": After integrating the left and right sides from formula_30 to V and from formula_31 to P and changing the sides respectively, Exponentiate both sides, and substitute formula_33 with formula_34, the heat capacity ratio and eliminate the negative sign to obtain Therefore, and Derivation of T-V relation for adiabatic heating and cooling.
Substituting the ideal gas law into the above, we obtain which simplifies to Derivation of discrete formula.
The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to At the same time, the work done by the pressure-volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true By the previous derivation, Rearranging (4) gives Substituting this into (2) gives Integrating, Substituting formula_48, Rearranging, Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases), By the continuous formula, Or, Substituting into the previous expression for formula_54, Substituting this expression and (1) in (3) gives Simplifying, Simplifying, Simplifying, Graphing adiabats.
An adiabat is a curve of constant entropy on the P-V diagram.
Some properties of adiabats on a P-V diagram are indicated.
These properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases, except in the region where "PV" becomes small (low temperature), where quantum effects become important.
The following diagram is a P-V diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms: The isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.
The adiabats are isentropic.
Volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis.
Etymology.
The term "adiabatic", literally means 'not to be passed through'.
It is formed from the ancient Greek privative "α" ("not") + "διαβατός", "able to be passed through", in turn deriving from "διὰ-" ("through"), and "βαῖνειν" ("to walk, go, come"), thus "ἀδιάβατος ".
According to  <START:person> Maxwell <END> , and to  <START:person> Partington <END> , the term was introduced by  <START:person> Rankine <END> .
The etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of transfer of energy as heat and of transfer of matter across the wall.
Divergent usages of the word adiabatic.
This present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics, and the word adiabatic is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics, introduced by  <START:person> Rankine <END> .
It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated.
In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be adiabatic (though often far from isentropic) even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated.
Quantum mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics, however, use the word adiabatic in very a different sense, one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense.
In quantum theory, the word adiabatic can mean something perhaps near isentropic, or perhaps near quasi-static, but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines.
On one hand in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly (that is to say quasi-statically), it is said to have been done adiabatically.
The idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously, so that no quantum jump is triggered, and the change is virtually reversible.
While the occupation numbers are unchanged, nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one-to-one corresponding, pre-and post-compression, eigenstates.
Thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system.
For example,  <START:person> Max Born <END>  writes "Actually, it is usually the 'adiabatic' case with which we have to do: i.e. the limiting case where the external force (or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other) acts very slowly.
In this case, to a very high approximation that is, there is no probability for a transition, and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation.
Such a slow perturbation is therefore reversible, as it is classically."
On the other hand in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly, it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates, as well as changing their shapes.
In that theory, such a rapid change is said not to be 'adiabatic', and the contrary word 'diabatic' is even applied to it.
One might guess that perhaps  <START:person> Clausius <END> , if he were confronted with this, in the now-obsolete language he used in his day, would have said that "internal work" was done and that 'heat was generated though not transferred'.
In classical thermodynamics, such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated, and there is no transfer of energy as heat.
The strong irreversibility of the change, due to viscosity or other entropy production, does not impinge on this classical usage.
Thus for a mass of gas, in macroscopic thermodynamics, words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer, even if the system is not adiabatically isolated.
But in quantum statistical theory, a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid, even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term.
The words are used differently in the two disciplines, as stated just above.
Abbotsford House  Abbotsford is a historic country house in the Scottish Borders, at the town of Galashiels, near Melrose, on the south bank of the River Tweed.
It was formerly the residence of historical novelist and poet,  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  (Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END> ,Bt).
It is a Category A Listed Building.
Description.
The nucleus of the estate was a small farm of 100 acre, called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i.e., muddy) Hole, and was bought by  <START:person> Scott <END>  on the lapse of his lease (1811) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel.
He first built a small villa and named it Abbotsford, creating the name from a ford nearby where previously abbots of Melrose Abbey used to cross the river.
 <START:person> Scott <END>  then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion, building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of Scotland.
In it he gathered a large library, a collection of ancient furniture, arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities, especially connected with Scottish history, notably the Celtic Torrs Pony-cap and Horns and the Woodwrae Stone, all now in the Museum of Scotland.
The last and principal acquisition was that of  <START:person> Toftfield <END>  (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in 1817.
The new house was then begun and completed in 1824.
The general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed; and the style is mainly the Scottish Baronial.
Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the old Tolbooth in Edinburgh.
 <START:person> Scott <END>  had only enjoyed his residence one year when (1825) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt.
In 1830 the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors.
The property was wholly disencumbered in 1847 by  <START:person> Robert Cadell <END> , the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family's share in the copyright of Sir  <START:person> Walter <END> 's works.
 <START:person> Scott <END> 's only son  <START:person> Walter <END>  did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from India in 1847.
Among subsequent possessors were  <START:person> Scott <END> 's son-in-law,  <START:person> John Gibson Lockhart <END> ,  <START:person> J. R. Hope Scott <END> , QC, and his daughter ( <START:person> Scott <END> 's great-granddaughter), the Hon.
Mrs  <START:person> Maxwell Scott <END> .
The house was opened to the public in 1833, but continued to be occupied by  <START:person> Scott <END> 's descendants until 2004.
The last of his direct descendants to inhabit Abbotsford was his great-great-great-granddaughter  <START:person> Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott <END>  (8 June 1923 5 May 2004).
She inherited it from her elder sister  <START:person> Patricia <END>  in 1998.
The sisters turned the house into one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house.
It had electricity installed only in 1962.
 <START:person> Dame Jean <END>  was at one time a lady-in-waiting to Princess  <START:person> Alice <END> , Duchess of Gloucester, patron of the Dandie Dinmont Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END> 's characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir  <START:person> Wattie <END> , ridden by  <START:person> Ian Stark <END> , won two silver medals at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Scottish Borders Council is considering an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the River Tweed from Abbotsford, to which Historic Scotland and the National Trust for Scotland object.
Sir  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  rescued the "jougs" from Threave Castle in Dumfries and  <START:person> Galloway <END>  and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at Abbotsford.
Tweedbank railway station is located near to Abbotsford House.
Miscellaneous.
Abbotsford gave its name to the Abbotsford Club, founded by  <START:person> William Barclay Turnbull <END>  in 1833 or 1834 in  <START:person> Scott <END> 's honour, and a successor to the  <START:person> Bannatyne <END>  and Maitland Clubs.
It was a text publication society, which existed to print and publish historical works connected with  <START:person> Scott <END> 's writings.
Its publications extended from 1835 to 1864.
In keeping with its many  <START:person> Walter Scott <END>  references, Rose Street in Edinburgh has a bar called the "Kenilworth", along with one named the "Abbotsford".
In 2012, a new Visitors Centre opened at Abbotsford which houses a small exhibition, Ochiltrees Diner and a gift shop In 2014 it won the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award for its recent conservation project.
 <START:person> Alan Kay  Alan Curtis Kay <END>  (born May 17, 1940) is an American computer scientist.
He has been elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society of Arts.
He is best known for his pioneering work on object-oriented programming and windowing graphical user interface design.
He is the president of the Viewpoints Research Institute, and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.
He is also on the advisory board of TTI/Vanguard.
Until mid-2005, he was a Senior Fellow at HP Labs, a Visiting Professor at Kyoto University, and an Adjunct Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
After 10 years at Xerox PARC,  <START:person> Kay <END>  became Atari's chief scientist for three years.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is also a former professional jazz guitarist, composer, and theatrical designer, and an amateur classical pipe organist.
Early life and work.
In an interview on education in America with the Davis Group Ltd.  <START:person> Alan Kay <END>  said, "I had the fortune or misfortune to learn how to read fluently starting at the age of three.
So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade.
And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me." Originally from Springfield, Massachusetts,  <START:person> Kay <END>  attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, earning a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Molecular Biology.
Before and during this time, he worked as a professional jazz guitarist.
In 1966, he began graduate school at the University of Utah College of Engineering, earning a Master's degree and a Ph.D. degree.
There, he worked with  <START:person> Ivan Sutherland <END> , who had done pioneering graphics programs including Sketchpad.
This greatly inspired  <START:person> Kay <END> 's evolving views on objects and programming.
As he grew busier with ARPA research, he quit his career as a professional musician.
In 1968, he met  <START:person> Seymour Papert <END>  and learned of the Logo programming language, a dialect of Lisp optimized for educational use.
This led him to learn of the work of  <START:person> Jean Piaget <END> ,  <START:person> Jerome Bruner <END> ,  <START:person> Lev Vygotsky <END> , and of constructionist learning.
These further influenced his views.
In 1970,  <START:person> Kay <END>  joined Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, PARC.
In the 1970s he was one of the key members there to develop prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language Smalltalk.
These inventions were later commercialized by Apple Computer in their  <START:person> Lisa <END>  and Macintosh computers.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is one of the fathers of the idea of object-oriented programming, which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC and predecessors at the Norwegian Computing Center.
He conceived the Dynabook concept which defined the conceptual basics for laptop and tablet computers and E-books, and is the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface (GUI).
Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform,  <START:person> Kay <END>  is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning, and indeed, many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the One Laptop Per Child educational platform, with which  <START:person> Kay <END>  is actively involved.
The field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen, according to  <START:person> Kay <END> , in which educational communities, parents, and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by  <START:person> Douglas Engelbart <END> , but a medium in  <START:person> Marshall McLuhan <END>  sense.
He wrote that the destiny of personal computing is not going to be: (...) a 'vehicle', as in Engelbart's metaphor opposed to the IBM 'railroads', but something much more profound: a (...) medium.
With a 'vehicle' one could wait until high school and give 'drivers ed', but if it was a medium, it had to extend into the world of childhood.
Recent work and recognition.
Starting in 1984,  <START:person> Kay <END>  was an Apple Fellow at Apple Computer until the closing of the ATG (Advanced Technology Group), one of the company's R&D divisions.
He then joined  <START:person> Walt Disney Imagineering <END>  as a Disney Fellow and remained there until Disney ended its Disney Fellow program.
After Disney, in 2001 he founded Viewpoints Research Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development.
Later,  <START:person> Kay <END>  worked with a team at Applied Minds, then became a Senior Fellow at Hewlett-Packard until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005.
He is currently head of Viewpoints Institute.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  taught a Fall 2011 class, "Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World", at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) along with full-time ITP faculty member  <START:person> Nancy Hechinger <END> .
The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching/learning based on fundamental, powerful concepts—rather than on traditional rote learning.
Squeak, Etoys, and Croquet.
In December 1995, when he was still at Apple,  <START:person> Kay <END>  collaborated with many others to start the open source Squeak version of Smalltalk, and he continues to work on it.
As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the Etoys system.
More recently he started, along with  <START:person> David A. Smith <END> ,  <START:person> David P. Reed <END> ,  <START:person> Andreas Raab <END> ,  <START:person> Rick McGeer <END> ,  <START:person> Julian Lombardi <END> , and  <START:person> Mark McCahill <END> , the Croquet Project, which is an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.
Tweak.
In 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do.
 <START:person> Andreas Raab <END>  was a researcher working in  <START:person> Kay <END> 's group, then at Hewlett-Packard.
He proposed defining a "script process" and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems.
The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future.
Tweak added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.
Its underlying object system is class-based, but to users (during programming) it acts like it is prototype-based.
Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.
Children's Machine.
In November 2005, at the World Summit on the Information Society, the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world.
It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the One Laptop per Child program, the Children's Machine, and the XO-1.
The program was begun and is sustained by  <START:person> Kay <END> 's friend,  <START:person> Nicholas Negroponte <END> , and is based on  <START:person> Kay <END> 's Dynabook ideal.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.
Reinventing programming.
 <START:person> Kay <END>  has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented.
Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled "The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" were informed by his experiences with Sketchpad, Simula, Smalltalk, and the bloated code of commercial software.
On August 31, 2006,  <START:person> Kay <END> 's proposal to the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) was granted, thus funding Viewpoints Research Institute for several years.
The proposal title was: "STEPS Toward the Reinvention of Programming": A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium.
A sense of what  <START:person> Kay <END>  is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: "The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days.
We wonder: how small could be an understandable practical "Model T" design that covers this functionality?
1M lines of code?
200K LOC? 100K LOC? 20K LOC?" Awards and honors.
 <START:person> Alan Kay <END>  has received many awards and honors.
Among them: Other honors: J-D Warnier Prix d’Informatique, ACM Systems Software Award, NEC Computers & Communication Foundation Prize, Funai Foundation Prize,  <START:person> Lewis Branscomb <END>  Technology Award, ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education.
Assault  In common law, assault is the act of creating apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact with a person.
An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm.
It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability.
Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law.
There is, however, an additional criminal law category of assault consisting of an attempted but unsuccessful battery.
The term is often confused with battery, which involves physical contact.
The specific meaning of assault varies between countries, but can refer to an act that causes another to apprehend immediate and personal violence, or in the more limited sense of a threat of violence caused by an immediate show of force.
Assault in many US jurisdictions and Scotland is defined more broadly still as any intentional physical contact with another person without their consent; but in England and Wales and in most other common law jurisdictions in the world, this is defined instead as battery.
Some jurisdictions have incorporated the definition of civil assault into the definition of the crime making it a criminal assault intentionally to cause another person to apprehend a harmful or offensive contact.
Related definitions.
Battery.
In common law, criminal assault often accompanies battery.
See common assault.
The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.
Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting him is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.
Aggravated assault.
Aggravated assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a deadly weapon.
A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to: Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.
Defenses.
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault: Consent.
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as de minimis harm.
Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.
Consent may be a complete or partial defense to assault.
In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.
This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual sadomasochistic sexual activity, the most notable case being the Operation Spanner case.
Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game (Mixed martial arts, wrestling, boxing, or contact sports), bodily adornment (R v Wilson), or horseplay ( <START:person> Jones <END>  and others).
However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent.
In Scottish Law, consent is not a defense for assault.
Arrest and other official acts.
Police officers and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an arrest or generally carrying out their official duties.
Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.
Punishment.
In some jurisdictions such as Singapore, judicial corporal punishment is part of the legal system.
The officers who administer the punishment have immunity from prosecution for assault.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable.
What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and case law.
Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for child abuse.
Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of less severe corporal punishment for children in school.
In English law, s58 Children Act 2004, limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s39 Criminal Justice Act 1988.
Prevention of crime.
This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.
Defense of property.
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in defense of property, to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 Criminal Damage Act 1971 it may be argued that the defendant has a "lawful excuse" to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 Criminal Law Act 1967) subject to the need to deter vigilantes and excessive self-help.
Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder.
The resident merely needs to assert to the court that he felt threatened by the intruder's presence.
This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.
Regional details.
Canada.
Assault is an offence under s.
265 of the Criminal Code of Canada.
Similar to the United States, there is a wide range of the type of Assault that can occur.
Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent.
It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person.
An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force.
It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.
He attempts or threatens, by an act or a gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes that other person to believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his purpose; or threats or fear of the application of force due to gestures to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed.
The Criminal Code of Canada describes Assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence).
Police Officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an Assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.
This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.
Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include: An individual cannot consent to an Assault with Weapon, Assault Causing Bodily Harm, Aggravated Assault, or any Sexual Assault.
Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon).
You cannot consent to serious bodily harm.
India.
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16, sections 351 through 358.
Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.
— s.351 of the Indian Penal Code The Code further explains that "mere words do not amount to an assault.
But the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault."
Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350).
The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.
Nigeria.
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.
Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act.
Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.
Pacific Islands.
Marshall Islands The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.
A person is guilty of this offence if he unlawfully offers or attempts, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.
Republic of Ireland.
Section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of assault causing harm.
South Africa.
South African law does not draw the distinction between assault and battery.
"Assault" is a common law crime defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him."
The law also recognises the crime of "assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm", where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health."
The common law crime of "indecent assault" was repealed by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007, and replaced by a statutory crime of "sexual assault".
United Kingdom.
Abolished offence: England and Wales.
English law provides for two offences of assault: common assault and battery.
Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence.
"Violence" in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile.
Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of battery, even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.
A common assault is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty.
Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the magistrates' court in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the Crown Court).
Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.
Scotland.
In Scots Law, assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another".
There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a "physical" attack on another's person, as demonstrated in " <START:person> Atkinson <END>  v. HM Advocate" wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a ski mask.
The court said: [A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm— <START:person> Atkinson <END>  v. HM Advocate (1987) Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or "Hamesuken" (to assault a person in his own home).
The "mens rea" for assault is simply "evil intent", although this has been held to mean no more than that assault "cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently" as upheld in "Lord Advocate's Reference No 2 of 1992" where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.
It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of his duty, under section 41 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
Northern Ireland.
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland.
The Offences against the Person Act 1861 creates the offences of: The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 creates the offences of: That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'.
under secction 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
United States.
American common law has defined assault as an attempt to commit a battery.
Assault is typically treated as a misdemeanor and not as a felony (unless it involves a law enforcement officer).
The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.
Four elements were required at common law: Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person.
The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault.
In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.
As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice.
These four elements were eventually codified in most states.
Laws on assault vary by state.
Since each state has its own laws, there is no universal assault law.
Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as battery, menacing, intimidation, reckless endangerment etc. in another state.
Modern American statutes may define assault as including: The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as exemplified below.
In Tennessee assault is defined as follows: 39-13-101.
Assault.
In Kansas the law on assault states: North Dakota law states: Simple assault.
States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double inchoate offense.
In some states, consent is a complete defense to assault.
In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a "petty misdemeanor".
In New York State assault as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120, requires an actual injury.
Other states define this as battery.
There is no crime of battery in New York.
The threat of imminent injury without physical contact in New York is called Menacing.
New York also has specific laws against Hazing when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.
Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human.
Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man.
However, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 treats the fetus as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances.
See  Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are: Ancient Greece.
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed hubris.
Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening pride, self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution.
In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well.
It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.
Violations of the law against hubris included what would today be termed assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.
Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of  <START:person> Demosthenes <END> , a prominent statesman and orator in ancient Greece.
These two examples occurred when first,  <START:person> Meidias <END>  punched  <START:person> Demosthenes <END>  in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against  <START:person> Konon <END> ) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.
Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens.
It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world.
That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved.
The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.
The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws.
Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic.
Atë, Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of his/her hubris, or great pride, that leads to his/her death or downfall.
Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame.
The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris.
This concept of honor is akin to a zero-sum game.
Rush  <START:person> Rehm <END>  simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

Abner  In the Book of  <START:person> Samuel <END> ,  <START:person> Abner <END>  (Hebrew אבנר "Avner" meaning "father of [or is a] light"), is cousin to  <START:person> Saul <END>  and commander-in-chief of his army (1  <START:person> Samuel <END>  14:50, 20:25).
He is often referred to as the son of Ner.
Biography.
 <START:person> Abner <END>  is only referred to incidentally in  <START:person> Saul <END> 's history (1  <START:person> Samuel <END>  17:55, 26:5), first appearing as the commander who introduced  <START:person> David <END>  to  <START:person> Saul <END>  following  <START:person> David <END> 's killing of Goliath.
He is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous battle of Gilboa when  <START:person> Saul <END> 's power was crushed.
Seizing the youngest but only surviving of  <START:person> Saul <END> 's sons, Ish-bosheth,  <START:person> Abner <END>  set him up as king over Israel at Mahanaim, east of the Jordan.
 <START:person> David <END> , who was accepted as king by  <START:person> Judah <END>  alone, was meanwhile reigning at Hebron, and for some time war was carried on between the two parties.
The only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy, inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at Gibeon between twelve chosen men from each side, in which the whole twenty-four seem to have perished (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  2:12).
In the general engagement which followed,  <START:person> Abner <END>  was defeated and put to flight.
He was closely pursued by  <START:person> Asahel <END> , brother of  <START:person> Joab <END> , who is said to have been "light of foot as a wild roe" (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  2:18).
As  <START:person> Asahel <END>  would not desist from the pursuit, though warned,  <START:person> Abner <END>  was compelled to slay him in self-defence.
This originated a deadly feud between the leaders of the opposite parties, for  <START:person> Joab <END> , as next of kin to  <START:person> Asahel <END> , was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood.
However, according to  <START:person> Josephus <END> , in Antiquities, Book 7, Chapter 1,  <START:person> Joab <END>  had forgiven  <START:person> Abner <END>  for the death of his brother,  <START:person> Asahel <END> , the reason being that  <START:person> Abner <END>  had slain  <START:person> Asahel <END>  honorably in combat after he had first warned  <START:person> Asahel <END>  and had no other choice but to kill him out of self-defense.
This battle was part of a civil war between  <START:person> David <END>  and Ish-bosheth, the son of  <START:person> Saul <END> .
After this battle  <START:person> Abner <END>  switched to the side of  <START:person> David <END>  and granted him control over the tribe of  <START:person> Benjamin <END> .
This act put  <START:person> Abner <END>  in  <START:person> David <END> 's favor.
The real reason that  <START:person> Joab <END>  killed  <START:person> Abner <END>  was that he became a threat to his rank of general.
He then justifies it later by mentioning his brother.
For some time afterward the war was carried on, the advantage being invariably on the side of  <START:person> David <END> .
At length, Ish-bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing  <START:person> Abner <END>  of sleeping with  <START:person> Rizpah <END>  (cf. 2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3:7), one of  <START:person> Saul <END> 's concubines, an alliance which, according to contemporary notions, would imply pretensions to the throne (cf. 2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  16:21ff.).
 <START:person> Abner <END>  was indignant at the rebuke, and immediately opened negotiations with  <START:person> David <END> , who welcomed him on the condition that his wife  <START:person> Michal <END>  should be restored to him.
This was done, and the proceedings were ratified by a feast.
Almost immediately after, however,  <START:person> Joab <END> , who had been sent away, perhaps intentionally returned and slew  <START:person> Abner <END>  at the gate of Hebron.
The ostensible motive for the assassination was a desire to avenge  <START:person> Asahel <END> , and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time.
The conduct of  <START:person> David <END>  after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act, though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3:31-39; cf. 1 Kings 2:31ff.).
 <START:person> David <END>  had  <START:person> Abner <END>  buried in Hebron (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  3.31-39).
His tomb, according to a medieval Jewish tradition, is considered to be in a building not far from the Cave of the Patriarchs.
Soon after  <START:person> Abner <END> 's death, Ish-bosheth was assassinated as he slept (2  <START:person> Samuel <END>  4), and  <START:person> David <END>  became king of the reunited kingdoms (2 Samuel 5).
 <START:person> Ahmed III  Ahmed III <END>  (Ottoman Turkish: احمد ثالث "Aḥmed-i sālis") (December 30/31, 1673 – July 1, 1736) was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a son of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–87).
His mother was  <START:person> Mâh-Pâre Ummatullah <END>  (Emetullah) Râbi'a Gül-Nûş Valide Sultan, originally named  <START:person> Evmania Voria <END> , who was an ethnic Greek.
He was born at Hajioglupazari, in Dobruja.
He succeeded to the throne in 1703 on the abdication of his brother  <START:person> Mustafa II <END>  (1695–1703).
 <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha <END>  and his daughter,  <START:person> Hatice Sultan <END>  (wife of the former) directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the "Tulip Era".
Biography.
 <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of Russia's menacing attitude; in fact, both his wives were Frenchwomen.
He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to  <START:person> Charles XII <END>  of Sweden (1682–1718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of  <START:person> Peter <END>  I of Russia (1672–1725) in the Battle of Poltava of 1709.
In 1710  <START:person> Charles XII <END>  convinced Sultan  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under  <START:person> Baltacı Mehmet Pasha <END>  won a major victory at the Battle of Prut.
In the aftermath, Russia returned Azov back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of Taganrog and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Forced against his will into war with Russia,  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  came nearer than any Ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his grand vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha <END>  succeeded in completely surrounding at the Pruth River Campaign in 1711.
The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished.
However, this was halted as a report reached Constantinople that the Safavids were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia.
Sultan  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen Janissaries, led by the Albanian  <START:person> Patrona Halil <END> , was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.
 <START:person> Ahmed <END>  voluntarily led his nephew  <START:person> Mahmud <END>  I (1730–54) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire.
He then retired to the Kafes previously occupied by  <START:person> Mahmud <END>  and died at Topkapı Palace after six years of confinement.
Character of  <START:person> Ahmed III <END> 's rule.
The reign of  <START:person> Ahmed III <END> , which had lasted for twenty-seven years, although marked by the disasters of the Great Turkish War, was not unsuccessful.
The recovery of  <START:person> Azov <END>  and the  <START:person> Morea <END> , and the conquest of part of Persia, managed to counterbalance the Balkan territory ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy through the Treaty of Passarowitz, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18.
In 1716, he sent an army of 33,000 men to capture Corfu from the Republic of Venice.
 <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  left the finances of the Ottoman Empire in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures.
He was a cultivated patron of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first printing press authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Constantinople, operated by  <START:person> Ibrahim Muteferrika <END>  (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).
It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the Danubian Principalities was introduced: previously, the Porte had appointed Hospodars, usually native Moldavian and Wallachian boyars, to administer those provinces; after the Russian campaign of 1711, during which Peter the Great found an ally in Moldavia Prince  <START:person> Dimitrie Cantemir <END> , the Porte began overtly deputizing Phanariote Greeks in that region, and extended the system to Wallachia after Prince  <START:person> Stefan Cantacuzino <END>  established links with  <START:person> Eugene of Savoy <END> .
The Phanariotes constituted a kind of "Dhimmi" nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.
Relations with the Mughal Empire.
 <START:person> Jahandar Shah <END> .
In the year 1712, the Mughal Emperor  <START:person> Jahandar Shah <END> , a grandson of  <START:person> Aurangzeb <END>  sent gifts to the Ottoman Sultan  <START:person> Ahmad III <END>  and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer.
Farrukhsiyar.
The Mughal Emperor  <START:person> Farrukhsiyar <END>  a grandson of  <START:person> Aurangzeb <END> , is also known to have sent a letter to the Ottomans but this time it was received by the Grand Vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha <END>  providing a graphic description of the efforts of the Mughal commander  <START:person> Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha <END>  against the Rajput and Maratha rebellion.
Marriages and issue.
He married  <START:person> Aminā <END>  ( <START:person> Emine <END> ) Mihr-î-Mâh Sultan and Râbi'a Sermi Sultan.
By the first wife he had  <START:person> Mustafa III <END>  and by the second wife he had  <START:person> Abdul Hamid I. <END> 
One of his daughters was  <START:person> Zeynep Asıme Sultan <END> .
Zeynep Sultan Mosque was built by her order.
 <START:person> Fatma Sultan <END>  was also his daughter and was married to grand vizier  <START:person> Nevşehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha <END> , by whom she directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the Tulip Era.
In fiction.
In Voltaire's "Candide", the eponymous main character meets the deposed  <START:person> Ahmed III <END>  on a ship from Venice to Constantinople.
The Sultan is in the company of five other deposed European monarchs, and he tells  <START:person> Candide <END> , who initially doubts his credentials: I am not jesting, my name is  <START:person> Achmet III <END> .
For several years I was Sultan; I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me; they cut off the heads of my viziers; I am ending my days in the old seraglio; my nephew,  <START:person> Sultan Mahmoud <END> , sometimes allows me to travel for my health, and I have come to spend the Carnival at Venice."
This episode was taken up by the modern Turkish writer  <START:person> Nedim Gürsel <END>  as the setting of his 2001 novel "Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul".
In fact, there is no evidence of the deposed Sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels, nor did  <START:person> Voltaire <END>  (or Gürsel) assert that it had any actual historical foundation.

Media related to at Wikimedia Commons+  Works written by or about at Wikisource  Agesilaus II  Agesilaus II (; Greek: Ἀγησίλαος "Agesilaos"; c. 444 – c. 360 BC), was a Eurypontid king of the Ancient Greek city-state of Sparta, ruling from approximately 400 BC to 360 BC, during most of which time he was, in Plutarch's words, "as good as thought commander and king of all Greece," and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country's deeds and fortunes.
Small in stature and lame from birth,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  became ruler somewhat unexpectedly in his mid-forties.
His reign saw successful military incursions into various states in Asia Minor, as well as successes in the Corinthian War; although several diplomatic decisions resulted in Sparta becoming increasingly isolated prior to his death at the age of 84 in Cyrenaica.
He was greatly admired by his friend, the historian  <START:person> Xenophon <END> , who wrote a minor work about him titled "Agesilaus".
History.
Early life.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was the son of Archidamus II and his second wife,  <START:person> Eupoleia <END> , brother to Cynisca (the first woman in ancient history to achieve an Olympic victory), and younger half-brother of Agis II.
There is little surviving detail on the youth of Agesilaus.
Born with one leg shorter, he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king Agis II, especially because the latter had a son (Leotychidas).
Therefore,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was trained in the traditional curriculum of Sparta, the "agoge."
However,  <START:person> Leotychidas <END>  was ultimately set aside as illegitimate (contemporary rumors representing him as the son of Alcibiades) and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  became king around 401 BC, at the age of about forty.
In addition to questions of his nephew's paternity,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> ' succession was largely due to the intervention of his Spartan general,  <START:person> Lysander <END> , who hoped to find in him a willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs.
 <START:person> Lysander <END>  and the young  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  came to maintain an intimate relation (see Pederasty in Ancient Greece), as was common of the period.
Their unique relationship would serve an important role during  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> ' later campaigns in Asia Minor.
Early reign.
Agesilaus is first recorded as king during the suppression of the conspiracy of Cinadon, shortly after 398 BC.
Then, in 396 BC,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  crossed into Asia with a force of 2,000 neodamodes (freed helots) and 6,000 allies (including 30 Spartiates) to liberate Greek cities from Persian dominion.
On the eve of sailing from Aulis he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as  <START:person> Agamemnon <END>  had done before the Trojan expedition, but the Thebans intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them.
On his arrival at Ephesus a three months' truce was concluded with Tissaphernes, the satrap of  <START:person> Lydia <END>  and Caria, but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  raided Phrygia, where he easily won immense booty from the satrap Pharnabazus;  <START:person> Tissaphernes <END>  could offer no assistance, as he had concentrated his troops in Caria.
In these campaigns  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  also benefited from the aid of the Ten Thousand (a mercenary army), who marched through miles of Persian territory to reach the Black Sea.
After spending the winter organizing a cavalry force ("hippeis"), he made a successful incursion into  <START:person> Lydia <END>  in the spring of 395 BC.
Tithraustes was sent to replace  <START:person> Tissaphernes <END> , who paid with his life for his continued failure.
An armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , who left the southern satrapy and again invaded Phrygia, which he ravaged until the following spring.
He then came to an agreement with Pharnabazus and once more turned southward.
During these campaigns,  <START:person> Lysander <END>  attempted to manipulate  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  into ceding his authority.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , the former passive lover of  <START:person> Lysander <END> , would have nothing of this, and reminded  <START:person> Lysander <END>  (who was only a Spartan general) who was king.
He had  <START:person> Lysander <END>  sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the Aegean.
This dominating move by  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  earned the respect of his men-at-arms and of  <START:person> Lysander <END>  himself, who remained emotionally close with Agesilaus.
In 394 BC, while encamped on the plain of Thebe, he was planning a campaign in the interior, or even an attack on Artaxerxes II himself, when he was recalled to Greece owing to the war between Sparta and the combined forces of Athens, Thebes, Corinth,  <START:person> Argos <END>  and several minor states.
A rapid march through Thrace and Macedonia brought him to Thessaly, where he repulsed the Thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him.
Reinforced by  <START:person> Phocian <END>  and Orchomenian troops and a Spartan army, he met the confederate forces at Coronea in Boeotia and in a hotly contested battle was technically victorious.
However, the Spartan baggage train was ransacked and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  himself was injured during the fighting, resulting in a subsequent retreat by way of Delphi to the Peloponnese.
Shortly before this battle the Spartan navy, of which he had received the supreme command, was totally defeated off Cnidus by a powerful Persian fleet under Conon and Pharnabazus.
During these conflicts in mainland Greece,  <START:person> Lysander <END>  perished while attacking the walls of Thebes.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END> , the second king of Sparta (see Spartan Constitution for more information on Sparta's dual monarchy), was supposed to provide  <START:person> Lysander <END>  with reinforcements as they marched into Boeotia, yet failed to arrive in time to assist  <START:person> Lysander <END> , likely because  <START:person> Pausanias <END>  disliked him for his brash and arrogant attitude towards the Spartan royalty and government.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END>  failed to fight for the bodies of the dead, and because he retrieved the bodies under truce (a sign of defeat), he was disgraced and banished from Sparta.
In 393 BC, Agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of Argolis.
In 392 BC he took a prominent part in the Corinthian War, making several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory and capturing Lechaeum and Piraeus.
The loss, however, of a battalion (mora), destroyed by Iphicrates, neutralized these successes, and  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  returned to Sparta.
In 389 BC he conducted a campaign in Acarnania, but two years later the Peace of Antalcidas, warmly supported by  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , put an end to hostilities.
In this interval,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  declined command over Sparta's aggression on Mantineia, and justified  <START:person> Phoebidas <END> ' seizure of the Theban Cadmea so long as the outcome provided glory to Sparta.
Decline.
When war broke out afresh with Thebes,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  twice invaded Boeotia (in 378 BC and 377 BC), although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness.
In the congress of 371 BC an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general  <START:person> Epaminondas <END> , and due to his influence, Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace, and orders given for Cleombrotus to march against Thebes in 371 BC.
 <START:person> Cleombrotus <END>  was defeated at Leuctra and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.
In 370 BC Agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to Mantineia, and reassured the Spartans with an invasion of Arcadia.
He preserved an un-walled Sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of helots, perioeci and even other Spartans; and against external enemies, with four different armies led by  <START:person> Epaminondas <END>  penetrating Laconia that same year.
Again, in 362 BC,  <START:person> Epaminondas <END>  almost succeeded in seizing the city with a rapid and unexpected march.
The Battle of Mantinea, in which  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy.
According to  <START:person> Xenophon <END> ,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END> , in order to gain money for prosecuting the war, supported the satrap Ariobarzanes II in his revolt against Artaxerxes II in 364 BC (Revolt of the Satraps), and in 361 BC he went to Egypt at the head of a mercenary force to aid the king Nectanebo I and his regent Teos against Persia.
He soon transferred his services to Teos's cousin and rival  <START:person> Nectanebo II <END> , who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 talents.
On his way home  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  died in Cyrenaica, around the age of 84, after a reign of some 41 years.
His body was embalmed in wax, and buried at Sparta.
Legacy.
Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was lame from birth.
These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an oracle having warned Sparta against a "lame reign."
Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in guerrilla warfare, alert and quick, yet cautious—a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time.
Of his courage, temperance, and hardiness, many instances are cited: and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend.
As examples: there is the story of his riding across a stick (horse made of stick) with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children; and because of the affection of his son  <START:person> Archidamus <END> ' for  <START:person> Cleonymus <END> , he saved Sphodrias,  <START:person> Cleonymus <END> ' father, from execution for his incursion into the Piraeus, and dishonorable retreat, in 378 BC.
Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus' reputation and achievements, reckoning him an excellent soldier, but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and siegecraft.
As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies.
 <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign: commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in Asia; and in extreme age, maintaining his prostrate country.
Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the Battle of Leuctra and thus the end of Spartan hegemony.
Other historical accounts paint  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  as a prototype for the ideal leader.
His awareness, thoughtfulness, and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically, while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic Greek commander.
These historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by  <START:person> Lysander <END>  in the former Athenian Empire and the failures of Spartan leaders (such as  <START:person> Pausanias <END>  and Kleombrotos) for the eventually suppression of Spartan power.
The ancient historian  <START:person> Xenophon <END>  was a huge admirer and served under Agesilaus during the campaigns into Asia Minor.
 <START:person> Plutarch <END>  includes among his 78 essays and speeches comprising the apophthegmata Agesilaus' letter to the ephors on his recall: We have reduced most of Asia, driven back the barbarians, made arms abundant in Ionia.
But since you bid me, according to the decree, come home, I shall follow my letter, may perhaps be even before it.
For my command is not mine, but my country's and her allies'.
And a commander then commands truly according to right when he sees his own commander in the laws and ephors, or others holding office in the state.
And when asked whether he wanted a memorial erected in his honor: If I have done any noble action, that is a sufficient memorial; if I have done nothing noble, all the statues in the world will not preserve my memory.
He lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field, and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty, he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth.
He was succeeded by his son  <START:person> Archidamus III <END> .
Selected quotes.
When someone was praising an orator for his ability to magnify small points, he said, "In my opinion it's not a good cobbler who fits large shoes on small feet."
Another time he watched a mouse being pulled from its hole by a small boy.
When the mouse turned around, bit the hand of its captor and escaped, he pointed this out to those present and said, "When the tiniest creature defends itself like this against aggressors, what ought men to do, do you reckon?"
Certainly when somebody asked what gain the laws of  <START:person> Lycurgus <END>  had brought Sparta, he answered, "Contempt for pleasures."
Asked once how far Sparta's boundaries stretched, he brandished his spear and said, "As far as this can reach."
On noticing a house in Asia roofed with square beams, he asked the owner whether timber grew square in that area.
When told no, it grew round, he said, "What then?
If it were square, would you make it round?"
As he was dying on the voyage back from Egypt, he gave instructions to those close to him that they should not be responsible for making any image of his person, be it modeled or painted or copied, "For if I have accomplished any glorious feat, that will be my memorial.
But if I have not, not even all the statues in the world—the products of vulgar, worthless men—would make any difference."
Invited to hear an actor who could perfectly imitate the nightingale,  <START:person> Agesilaus <END>  declined, saying he had heard the nightingale itself.
 <START:person> Arthur Aikin  Arthur Aikin <END> , FLS, FGS (19 May 1773 – 15 April 1854) was an English chemist, mineralogist and scientific writer.
Life.
He was born at Warrington, Lancashire into a distinguished literary family of prominent Unitarians.
The best known of these was his paternal aunt,  <START:person> Anna Letitia Barbauld <END> , a woman of letters who wrote poetry and essays as well as early children's literature.
His father, Dr  <START:person> John Aikin <END> , was a medical doctor, historian, and author.
His grandfather, also called  <START:person> John Aikin <END>  (1713–1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with Warrington Academy.
His sister  <START:person> Lucy <END>  (1781–1864) was a historical writer.
Their brother  <START:person> Charles <END>  was adopted by their famous aunt and brought up as their cousin.
 <START:person> Arthur Aikin <END>  studied chemistry under  <START:person> Joseph Priestley <END>  in the New College at Hackney, and gave attention to the practical applications of the science.
In early life he was a Unitarian minister for a short time.
 <START:person> Aikin <END>  lectured on chemistry at Guy's Hospital for thirty-two years.
From 1803 to 1808 he was editor of the "Annual Review".
He was one of the founders of the Geological Society of London in 1807 and was its honorary secretary in 1812–1817.
He contributed papers on the Wrekin and the Shropshire coalfield, among others, to the transactions of that society.
Later he became Secretary of the Royal Society of Arts.
He was founder of the Chemical Society of London in 1841, being its first Treasurer and second President.
He was highly esteemed as a man of sound judgment and wide knowledge, he was also elected as FRSA, having served as its Secretary.
 <START:person> Aikin <END>  died at Hoxton in London.
Publications.
For " <START:person> Rees <END> 's Cyclopædia" he wrote articles about Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy, but the topics are not known.
Ajax (mythology)  Ajax or Aias ( or ; Ancient Greek: Αἴας, gen.
Αἴαντος) was a mythological Greek hero, the son of King Telamon and Periboea, and the half-brother of Teucer.
He plays an important role in Homer's "Iliad" and in the Epic Cycle, a series of epic poems about the Trojan War.
To distinguish him from Ajax, son of Oileus (Ajax the Lesser), he is called "Telamonian Ajax," "Greater Ajax," or "Ajax the Great".
In Etruscan mythology, he is known as Aivas Tlamunus.
Family.
Ajax is the son of Telamon, who was the son of Aeacus and grandson of Zeus, and his first wife  <START:person> Periboea <END> .
He is the cousin of Achilles, and is the elder half-brother of Teucer.
Many illustrious Athenians, including  <START:person> Cimon <END> ,  <START:person> Miltiades <END> ,  <START:person> Alcibiades <END>  and the historian Thucydides, traced their descent from Ajax.
The Italian scholar  <START:person> Maggiani <END>  recently showed that on an Etruscan tomb dedicated to  <START:person> Racvi Satlnei <END>  in Bologna (5th century BC) there is a writing that says: "aivastelmunsl = family of Ajax Télamon".
Description.
In Homer's "Iliad" he is described as of great stature, colossal frame and strongest of all the Achaeans.
Known as the "bulwark of the Achaeans", he was trained by the centaur Chiron (who had trained Ajax' father Telamon and  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' father  <START:person> Peleus <END>  and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by Heracles, whom he was at the time training), at the same time as  <START:person> Achilles <END> .
He was described as vicious, fearless, strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence.
Ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow-hides with a layer of bronze.
Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the "Iliad", and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles, although, in book 13, Poseidon strikes Ajax with his staff, renewing his strength.
Trojan War.
In the "Iliad", Ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage, seen particularly in two fights with  <START:person> Hector <END> .
In Book 7, Ajax is chosen by lot to meet  <START:person> Hector <END>  in a duel which lasts most of a whole day.
Ajax at first gets the better of the encounter, wounding  <START:person> Hector <END>  with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone, but  <START:person> Hector <END>  fights on until the heralds, acting at the direction of Zeus, call a draw: the action ends without a winner and with the two combatants exchanging gifts, Ajax giving  <START:person> Hector <END>  a purple sash and  <START:person> Hector <END>  giving Ajax his sharp sword.
The second fight between Ajax and  <START:person> Hector <END>  occurs when the latter breaks into the Mycenaean camp, and fights with the Greeks among the ships.
In Book 14, Ajax throws a giant rock at Hector which almost kills him.
In Book 15,  <START:person> Hector <END>  is restored to his strength by Apollo and returns to attack the ships.
Ajax, wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship, holds off the Trojan armies virtually single-handedly.
In Book 16,  <START:person> Hector <END>  and Ajax duel once again.
 <START:person> Hector <END>  is set on burning the ships, the only way he feels the Greeks will truly be defeated.
 <START:person> Hector <END>  is able to disarm Ajax (although Ajax is not hurt) and Ajax is forced to retreat, seeing that Zeus is clearly favoring  <START:person> Hector <END> .
 <START:person> Hector <END>  and the Trojans succeed in burning one Greek ship, the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war.
Ajax is responsible for the death of many Trojans lords, including Phorcys.
Ajax often fought in tandem with his brother  <START:person> Teucer <END> , known for his skill with the bow.
Ajax would wield his magnificent shield, as  <START:person> Teucer <END>  stood behind picking off enemy Trojans.
 <START:person> Achilles <END>  was absent during these encounters because of his feud with Agamemnon.
In Book 9, Agamemnon and the other Mycenaean chiefs send Ajax, Odysseus and Phoenix to the tent of Achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight.
Although Ajax speaks earnestly and is well received, he does not succeed in convincing Achilles.
When Patroclus is killed,  <START:person> Hector <END>  tries to steal his body.
Ajax, assisted by  <START:person> Menelaus <END> , succeeds in fighting off the Trojans and taking the body back with his chariot; however, the Trojans had already stripped Patroclus of Achilles' armor.
Ajax's prayer to Zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial.
According to  <START:person> Hyginus <END> , in total, Ajax killed 28 people at Troy.
Death.
Like most of the other Greek leaders, Ajax is alive and well as the "Iliad" comes to a close.
When  <START:person> Achilles <END>  dies, killed by Paris (with help from Apollo), Ajax and  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  are the heroes who fight against the Trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion, Patroclus.
Ajax, with his great shield and spear, manages to drive off the Trojans, while  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  pulls the body to his chariot, and rides away with it to safety.
After the burial, each claims  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' magical armor for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts.
After several days of competition, Odysseus and Ajax are tied for the ownership of the divine armor, which had been forged on Mount Olympus by the smith-god Hephaestus.
It is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor.
Ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the Greeks, including saving the ships from  <START:person> Hector <END> , and driving him off with a massive rock, he deserves the armor.
However,  <START:person> Odysseus <END>  proves to be more eloquent, and the council gives him the armor.
Ajax, "Unconquered", and furious, falls upon his own sword, "conquered by his [own] sorrow".
The Belvedere Torso, a marble torso now in the Vatican Museums, is considered to depict Ajax "in the act of contemplating his suicide".
In Sophocles' play "Ajax", a famous retelling of Ajax's demise, after the armor is awarded to Odysseus Ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill Agamemnon and  <START:person> Menelaus <END> .
Athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision, and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them, imagining they are the Achaean leaders, including Odysseus and Agamemnon.
When he comes to his senses, covered in blood, he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor, and decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than live in shame.
He does so with the same sword which  <START:person> Hector <END>  gave him when they exchanged presents.
From his blood sprang a red flower, as at the death of Hyacinthus, which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name "Ai," also expressive of lament.
His ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the Rhoetean promontory at the entrance of the Hellespont.
Ajax's half-brother  <START:person> Teucer <END>  stood trial before his father for not bringing Ajax's body or weapons back.
 <START:person> Teucer <END>  was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence.
He was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home, the island of Salamis off the coast of Athens.
Homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of Ajax's death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over  <START:person> Achilles <END> ' armor; when Odysseus visits Hades, he begs the soul of Ajax to speak to him, but Ajax, still resentful over the old quarrel, refuses and descends silently back into Erebus.
Like  <START:person> Achilles <END> , he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death on the island of Leuke at the mouth of the Danube.
Ajax, who in the post-Homeric legend is described as the grandson of Aeacus and the great-grandson of Zeus, was the tutelary hero of the island of Salamis, where he had a temple and an image, and where a festival called "Aianteia" was celebrated in his honour.
At this festival a couch was set up, on which the panoply of the hero was placed, a practice which recalls the Roman Lectisternium.
The identification of Ajax with the family of  <START:person> Aeacus <END>  was chiefly a matter which concerned the Athenians, after Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion Solon is said to have inserted a line in the "Iliad" (2.557–558), for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island.
Ajax then became an Attic hero; he was worshiped at Athens, where he had a statue in the market-place, and the tribe "Aiantis" was named after him.
 <START:person> Pausanias <END>  also relates that a gigantic skeleton, its kneecap 5 in in diameter, appeared on the beach near Sigeion, on the Trojan coast; these bones were identified as those of Ajax.
Other.
There is a legend that Ajax founded the city of Ajaccio in the mediterranean island of Corsica (now part of France) and gave it his name.
Palace.
In 2001,  <START:person> Yannos Lolos <END>  began excavating a Mycenaean palace on the island of Salamis which he supposed to be the home of the mythological Aiacid dynasty.
The ruins have been excavated at a site near the village of Kanakia of Salamis, a few miles off the coast of Athens.
The multi-story structure covers 750 m2 and had perhaps 30 rooms.
The Trojan War is supposed by many to have occurred at the height of the Mycenaean civilization (see discussion of Troy VII), roughly the point at which this palace appears to have been abandoned.
 <START:person> Alexander II of Epirus  Alexander II <END>  was a king of Epirus, and the son of  <START:person> Pyrrhus <END>  and  <START:person> Lanassa <END> , the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant  <START:person> Agathocles <END> .
Reign.
He succeeded his father as king in 272 BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with  <START:person> Antigonus II Gonatas <END> , whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of Macedon.
He was, however, dispossessed of both Macedon and Epirus by  <START:person> Demetrius II of Macedon <END> , the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the Acarnanians.
By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus.
It appears that he was in alliance with the Aetolians.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  married his paternal half-sister Olympias, by whom he had two sons,  <START:person> Pyrrhus <END> ,  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  and a daughter, Phthia.
On the death of  <START:person> Alexander <END> , around 242 BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to  <START:person> Demetrius <END> .
There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.
The former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephant's head.
The reverse represents  <START:person> Pallas <END>  holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt.
Relations with India.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  is apparently mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor  <START:person> Ashoka <END> 's Buddhist proselytism.
 <START:person> Alexander of Aphrodisias  Alexander <END>  of Aphrodisias (Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Ἀφροδισιεύς; fl.
200 AD) was a Peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the Ancient Greek commentators on the writings of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> .
He was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria, and lived and taught in Athens at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the Peripatetic school.
He wrote many commentaries on the works of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , extant are those on the "Prior Analytics", "Topics", "Meteorology", "Sense and Sensibilia", and "Metaphysics".
Several original treatises also survive, and include a work "On Fate", in which he argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity; and one "On the Soul".
His commentaries on  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, "the commentator" (ὁ ἐξηγητής).
Life and career.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria and came to Athens towards the end of the 2nd century.
He was a student of the two Stoic, or possibly Peripatetic, philosophers Sosigenes and Herminus, and perhaps of  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  of Mytilene.
At Athens he became head of the Peripatetic school and lectured on Peripatetic philosophy.
 <START:person> Alexander <END> 's dedication of "On Fate" to  <START:person> Septimius Severus <END>  and  <START:person> Caracalla <END> , in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209.
A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as  <START:person> Titus Aurelius Alexander <END> .
His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor  <START:person> Antoninus Pius <END> , while proconsul of Asia.
The inscription honours his father, also called  <START:person> Alexander <END>  and also a philosopher.
This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's corpus should be ascribed to his father.
Commentaries.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  composed several commentaries on the works of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , in which he sought to escape a syncretistic tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> .
His extant commentaries are on "Prior Analytics" (Book 1), "Topics", "Meteorology", "Sense and Sensibilia", and "Metaphysics" (Books 1-5).
The commentary on the "Sophistical Refutations" is deemed spurious, as is the commentary on the final nine books of the "Metaphysics".
The lost commentaries include works on the "De Interpretatione", "Posterior Analytics", "Physics", "On the Heavens", "On Generation and Corruption", "On the Soul", and "On Memory".
Simplicius of Cilicia mentions that  <START:person> Alexander <END>  provided commentary on the quadrature of the lunes, and the corresponding problem of squaring the circle.
In April 2007, it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on  <START:person> Aristotle <END> 's "Categories" in the Archimedes Palimpsest, and  <START:person> Robert Sharples <END>  suggested  <START:person> Alexander <END>  as the most likely author.
Original treatises.
There are also several extant original writings by  <START:person> Alexander <END> .
These include: "On the Soul", "Problems and Solutions", "Ethical Problems", "On Fate", and "On Mixture and Growth".
Three works attributed to him are considered spurious: "Medical Questions", "Physical Problems", and "On Fevers".
Additional works by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  are preserved in Arabic translation, these include: "On the Principles of the Universe", "On Providence", and "Against  <START:person> Galen <END>  on Motion".
"On the Soul" ("De anima") is a treatise on the soul written along the lines suggested by  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  in his own "De anima".
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material ("nous hulikos") and inseparable from the body.
He argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul's immortality.
He identified the active intellect ("nous poietikos"), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with God.
A second book is known as the "Supplement to On the Soul" ("Mantissa").
The "Mantissa" is a series of twenty-five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with psychology.
The remaining twenty pieces cover problems in physics and ethics, of which the largest group deals with questions of vision and light, and the final four with fate and providence.
The "Mantissa" was probably not written by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  in its current form, but much of the actual material may be his.
"Problems and Solutions" ("Quaestiones") consists of three books which, although termed "problems and solutions of physical questions," treat of subjects which are not all physical, and are not all problems.
Among the sixty-nine items in these three books, twenty-four deal with physics, seventeen with psychology, eleven with logic and metaphysics, and six with questions of fate and providence.
It is unlikely that  <START:person> Alexander <END>  wrote all of the "Quaestiones", some may be  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's own explanations, while others may be exercises by his students.
"Ethical Problems" was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the "Quaestiones".
The work is a discussion of ethical issues based on  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's school.
It is likely that the work was not written by  <START:person> Alexander <END>  himself, but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving  <START:person> Alexander <END> .
"On Fate" is a treatise in which  <START:person> Alexander <END>  argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity.
In "On Fate"  <START:person> Alexander <END>  denied three things necessity (Greek: ἀνάγκη), the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature, and determinism in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand (Greek: προκαταβεβλημένος) or predetermined by antecedents (Greek: προηγουμένος).
He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today.
"On Mixture and Growth" discusses the topic of mixture of physical bodies.
It is both an extended discussion (and polemic) on Stoic physics, and an exposition of Aristotelian thought on this theme.
"On the Principles of the Universe" is preserved in Arabic translation.
This treatise is not mentioned in surviving Greek sources, but it enjoyed great popularity in the Muslim world, and a large number of copies have survived.
The main purpose of this work is to give a general account of Aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics, but it also has a polemical tone, and it may be directed at rival views within the Peripatetic school.
 <START:person> Alexander <END>  was concerned with filling the gaps of the Aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies, while also presenting a unified picture of the world, both physical and ethical.
The topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the sublunar world of generation and decay.
His principal sources are the "Physics" (book 7), "Metaphysics" (book 12), and the Pseudo-Aristotelian "On the Universe".
"On Providence" survives in two Arabic versions.
In this treatise,  <START:person> Alexander <END>  opposes the Stoic view that divine Providence extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods.
Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.
Influence.
By the 6th century  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's commentaries on  <START:person> Aristotle <END>  were considered so useful that he was referred to as "the commentator" (Greek: ὁ ἐξηγητής).
His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the Arabs, who translated many of them, and he is heavily quoted by Maimonides.
In 1210, the Church Council of Paris issued a condemnation, which probably targeted the writings of  <START:person> Alexander <END>  among others.
In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by  <START:person> Pietro Pomponazzi <END>  (against the Thomists and the Averroists), and by his successor  <START:person> Cesare Cremonini <END> .
This school is known as Alexandrists.
 <START:person> Alexander <END> 's band, an optical phenomenon, is named after him.
Modern editions.
Several of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's works were published in the Aldine edition of  <START:person> Aristotle <END> , Venice, 1495–1498; his "De Fato" and "De Anima" were printed along with the works of Themistius at Venice (1534); the former work, which has been translated into Latin by  <START:person> Grotius <END>  and also by  <START:person> Schulthess <END> , was edited by  <START:person> J. C. Orelli <END> ,  <START:person> Zürich <END> , 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by  <START:person> H. Bonitz <END> , Berlin, 1847.
In 1989 the first part of his "On Aristotle Metaphysics" was published as part of the Ancient commentators project.
Since then, other works of his have been translated into English.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson  Andrew Jackson <END>  (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was the seventh President of the United States (1829–1837).
He was born near the end of the colonial era, somewhere near the then-unmarked border between North and South Carolina, into a recently immigrated Scots-Irish farming family of relatively modest means.
During the American Revolutionary War  <START:person> Jackson <END> , whose family supported the revolutionary cause, acted as a courier.
He was captured, at age 13, and mistreated by his British captors.
He later became a lawyer, and in 1796 he was in Nashville and helped found the state of Tennessee.
He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and then to the U.S. Senate.
In 1801,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia, which became his political as well as military base.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  owned hundreds of slaves who worked on the Hermitage plantation which he acquired in 1804.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  killed a man in a duel in 1806, over a matter of honor regarding his wife  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  gained national fame through his role in the War of 1812, most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at the Battle of New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's army was then sent to Florida where he deposed the small Spanish garrison.
This led directly to the treaty which formally transferred Florida from Spain to the United States.
Nominated for president in 1824,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  narrowly lost to  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's supporters then founded what became the Democratic Party.
Nominated again in 1828,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  crusaded against  <START:person> Adams <END>  and the "corrupt bargain" between  <START:person> Adams <END>  and  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  he said cost him the 1824 election.
Building on his base in the West and new support from Virginia and New York, he won by a landslide.
The  <START:person> Adams <END>  campaigners called him and his wife  <START:person> Rachel Jackson <END>  "bigamists"; she died just after the election and he called the slanderers "murderers," swearing never to forgive them.
His struggles with Congress were personified in his personal rivalry with  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , whom  <START:person> Jackson <END>  deeply disliked, and who led the opposition (the emerging Whig Party).
As president, he faced a threat of secession from South Carolina over the "Tariff of Abominations" which Congress had enacted under  <START:person> Adams <END> .
In contrast to several of his immediate successors, he denied the right of a state to secede from the union, or to nullify federal law.
The Nullification Crisis was defused when the tariff was amended and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  threatened the use of military force if South Carolina (or any other state) attempted to secede.
Congress attempted to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States several years before the expiration of its charter, which he opposed.
He vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832, and dismantled it by the time its charter expired in 1836.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the "spoils system" in American politics.
Also, he supported, signed, and enforced the Indian Removal Act, which relocated a number of native tribes to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).
He faced and defeated  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  in the 1832 Presidential Election, and opposed  <START:person> Clay <END>  generally.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  supported his vice president  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , who was elected president in 1836.
He worked to bolster the Democratic Party and helped his friend  <START:person> James K. Polk <END>  win the 1844 presidential election.
Early life and education.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was born on March 15, 1767.
His parents were Scots-Irish colonists  <START:person> Andrew <END>  and  <START:person> Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson <END> , Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ireland two years earlier.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's parents lived in the village of Boneybefore, also in County Antrim.
When they emigrated to America in 1765,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's parents probably landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
They would have traveled overland down through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the Waxhaws region, straddling the border between North and South Carolina.
They brought two children from Ireland,  <START:person> Hugh <END>  (born 1763) and  <START:person> Robert <END>  (born 1764).
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father died in an accident in February 1767, at the age of 29, three weeks before his son  <START:person> Andrew <END>  was born in the Waxhaws area.
His exact birth site is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's father.
The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed.
In 1824,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation in Lancaster County, South Carolina.
But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824, which  <START:person> Jackson <END>  opposed.
In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  received a sporadic education in the local "old-field" school.
In 1781, he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop.
Later, he taught school and studied law in Salisbury, North Carolina.
In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved to Jonesborough, in what was then the Western District of North Carolina.
This area later became the Southwest Territory (1790), the precursor to the state of Tennessee.
Revolutionary War service.
During the Revolutionary War,  <START:person> Jackson <END> , at age thirteen, informally helped the local militia as a courier.
His eldest brother,  <START:person> Hugh <END> , died from heat exhaustion during the Battle of Stono Ferry, on June 20, 1779.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  and his brother  <START:person> Robert <END>  were captured by the British and held as prisoners; they nearly starved to death in captivity.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving  <START:person> Jackson <END>  with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British.
While imprisoned, the brothers contracted smallpox.
 <START:person> Robert Jackson <END>  died on April 27, 1781, a few days after their mother  <START:person> Elizabeth <END>  secured the brothers' release.
After being assured  <START:person> Andrew <END>  would recover,  <START:person> Elizabeth Jackson <END>  volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in Charleston harbor, where there had been an outbreak of cholera.
She died from the disease in November 1781, and was buried in an unmarked grave.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  became an orphan at age 14.
Following the deaths of his brothers and mother during the war,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  blamed the British for his losses.
Legal and political career.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  began his legal career in Jonesborough, now northeastern Tennessee.
Though his legal education was scanty, he knew enough to be a country lawyer on the frontier.
Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law.
Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from assault and battery.
In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor (prosecutor) of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the Territory South of the River Ohio after 1791.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796.
When Tennessee achieved statehood that year,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was elected its U.S. Representative.
The following year, he was elected U.S. Senator as a Democratic-Republican, but he resigned within a year.
(His return to the U.S. Senate in 1823, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.)
In 1798, he was appointed a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court, serving until 1804.
Land speculation and founding of Memphis.
In 1794,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  formed a business with  <START:person> John Overton <END>  "for the purpose of purchasing lands as well those lands without as within military bounds"—overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw.
Upon his return from Florida,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  negotiated the sale of the land from the Chickasaw Nation in 1818 (termed the Jackson Purchase).
He was one of the three original investors who founded Memphis, Tennessee in 1819 (see History of Memphis, Tennessee).
Hermitage plantation.
In addition to his legal and political career,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  prospered as planter, slave owner, and merchant.
He built a home and the first general store in Gallatin, Tennessee in 1803.
The next year he acquired the Hermitage, a 640 acre plantation in Davidson County, near Nashville.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  later added 360 acre to the plantation, which eventually grew to 1050 acres.
The primary crop was cotton, grown by enslaved workers.
Starting with nine slaves,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  held as many as 44 by 1820, and later held up to 150 slaves, making him among the planter elite.
Throughout his lifetime  <START:person> Jackson <END>  may have owned as many as 300 slaves.
African American men, women, and children were enslaved by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  on three sections of the Hermitage plantation.
Slaves lived in extended family units between five and ten persons quartered in 20-foot-square cabins made either of brick or logs.
The size and quality of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times.
To help slaves acquire food staples, in addition to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's rations,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  supplied slaves with guns, knives, and fishing equipment for hunting and fishing.
At times  <START:person> Jackson <END>  paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets.
The Hermitage plantation was a profit-making enterprise and  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who demanded slave loyalty, permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  at various times posted advertisements for his fugitive slaves.
For the standards of his times  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food, housing, and did not prohibit his female slaves from childbirthing.
Military career.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank of colonel.
He was later elected major general of the Tennessee militia in 1802.
War of 1812.
Creek campaign and treaty.
During the War of 1812, the Shawnee chief  <START:person> Tecumseh <END>  encouraged the "Red Stick" Creek Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements.
He had unified tribes in the Northwest to rise up against the Americans, trying to repel American settlers from those lands north of the Ohio.
Four hundred settlers were killed in the Fort Mims massacre—one of the few instances of Native Americans killing a large number of American settlers and their African-American slaves—which brought the United States into the internal Creek campaign.
Occurring at the same time as the War of 1812, the Creek campaign saw  <START:person> Jackson <END>  command the U.S. forces, which included the Tennessee militia, U.S. regulars, and Cherokee, Choctaw, and Lower Creek warriors.
 <START:person> Sam Houston <END>  and  <START:person> David Crockett <END>  served under  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in this campaign.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  defeated the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814.
US forces and their allies killed 800 Red Stick warriors in this battle, but spared the chief Red Eagle, a mixed-race man also known as  <START:person> William Weatherford <END> .
After the victory,  <START:person> Madison <END> 's Secretary of War  <START:person> Armstrong <END>  ordered Major General  <START:person> Thomas Pinckney <END>  in April 1814 to make the surrender treaty.
 <START:person> Pinckney <END>  made moderate terms of surrender including handing over an unspecified amount of land, the construction of U.S. forts, turning over warriors who instigated hostilities, and agreeing to stop trade with foreign countries.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  opposed the unpopular  <START:person> Pinckney <END>  treaty, desiring to completely destroy the Creek nation.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was promoted Major General and given charge of the Seventh Military District, replacing Major General  <START:person> Thomas Flournoy <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , now commanding general, immediately threw out  <START:person> Pinckney <END> 's treaty and forced severe terms upon both the Upper Creek enemies and the Lower Creek allies, wresting twenty-two million acres in present-day Georgia and Alabama from all the Creek for European-American settlement.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also confiscated land from Indians who had sided with the Americans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated that the terms must be accepted or the tribe would be forcefully removed to Florida.
On August 9, 1814, 35 Indian elder leaders signed  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Treaty of Fort Jackson.
The warrior faction of the Creek nation and the British, however, did not formally recognize the treaty.
According to author  <START:person> Gloria Jahoda <END> , the Creeks coined their own name for him, " <START:person> Jacksa Chula Harjo <END> " or " <START:person> Jackson <END> , old and fierce".
Battle of New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success.
When British forces threatened New Orleans,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories.
He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops.
They said he was "tough as old hickory" wood on the battlefield, and he acquired the nickname of "Old Hickory".
In the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's 5,000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7,500 British.
At the end of the battle, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing.
The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.
Enforced martial law New Orleans.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  ordered the arrest of U. S. District Court Judge Dominick Hall in March 1815, after the judge signed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a Louisiana legislator that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had arrested.
 <START:person> Louis Louaillier <END>  had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's refusal to release the militia, after the British ceded the field of battle.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had claimed the authority to declare martial law over the entire City of New Orleans, not merely his "camp."
After ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, a lawyer and after intervention of  <START:person> Joshua Lewis <END> , a State Judge, who was simultaneously serving under  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the militia, and who also signed a writ of habeas corpus against  <START:person> Jackson <END> , his commanding officer, seeking Judge  <START:person> Hall <END> 's release,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  relented.
Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
But they fared better than did the six members of the militia whose executions, ordered by  <START:person> Jackson <END> , would surface as the Coffin Handbills during his 1828 Presidential campaign.
Nonetheless,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became a national hero for his actions in this battle and the War of 1812.
By a resolution on February 27, 1815,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  received the Thanks of Congress as well as a Congressional Gold Medal.
 <START:person> Alexis de Tocqueville <END> , "underwhelmed" by  <START:person> Jackson <END> , later commented in "Democracy in America" that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  "... was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."
First Seminole War.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  served in the military again during the First Seminole War.
He was ordered by President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  in December 1817 to lead a campaign in Georgia against the Seminole and Creek Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was also charged with preventing Spanish Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves.
Critics later alleged that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  exceeded orders in his Florida actions.
His directions were to "terminate the conflict".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida.
Before going,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote to  <START:person> Monroe <END> , "Let it be signified to me through any channel ... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."
 <START:person> Monroe <END>  gave  <START:person> Jackson <END>  orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.
The Seminole attacked  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Tennessee volunteers.
The Seminole attack left their villages vulnerable, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  burned their houses and the crops.
He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the United Kingdom encouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  captured Pensacola, Florida, with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor.
He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects,  <START:person> Robert Ambrister <END>  and  <START:person> Alexander Arbuthnot <END> , who had been supplying and advising the Indians.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's actions struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (he became known as "Sharp Knife").
The executions, and  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident.
Many in the  <START:person> Monroe <END>  administration called for  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to be censured.
The Secretary of State,  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> , an early believer in Manifest Destiny, defended  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
When the Spanish minister demanded a "suitable punishment" for  <START:person> Jackson <END> ,  <START:person> Adams <END>  wrote back, "Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory ... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact ... a post of annoyance to them."
 <START:person> Adams <END>  used  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the  <START:person> Adams <END> –Onís Treaty.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was subsequently named Florida's military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.
Election of 1824.
The Tennessee legislature nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President in 1822.
It also elected him U.S. Senator again.
By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party.
Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal Congressional nominating caucus, but this had become unpopular.
In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus.
Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary  <START:person> William H. Crawford <END>  for President and  <START:person> Albert Gallatin <END>  for Vice President.
A Pennsylvania convention nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" and was a "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [ <START:person> Crawford <END> ] was the regular democratic candidate".
Gallatin criticized  <START:person> Jackson <END>  as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office".
Besides  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Crawford <END> , the Secretary of State  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END>  and House Speaker  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  were also candidates.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot).
The electoral votes were split four ways, with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  having a plurality.
Because no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the House of Representatives, which chose  <START:person> Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  supporters denounced this result as a "corrupt bargain" because  <START:person> Clay <END>  gave his state's support to  <START:person> Adams <END> , who subsequently appointed  <START:person> Clay <END>  as Secretary of State.
As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for  <START:person> Adams <END> , and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had won the popular vote, some Kentucky politicians criticized  <START:person> Clay <END>  for violating the will of the people in return for personal political favors.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the "man of the people" had been robbed by the "corrupt aristocrats of the East".
Election of 1828.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  denounced the "corrupt bargain" that put  <START:person> Adams <END>  in the White House and laid plans for a crusade to oust  <START:person> Adams <END>  from office.
After resigning the Senate in October 1825, he continued his quest for the Presidency.
The Tennessee legislature again nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for President.
He attracted Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , and  <START:person> Thomas Ritchie <END>  into his camp ( <START:person> Van Buren <END>  and  <START:person> Ritchie <END>  were previous supporters of  <START:person> Crawford <END> ).
 <START:person> Van Buren <END> , with help from his friends in Philadelphia and Richmond, revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, "restored party rivalries", and forged a national organization of durability.
The  <START:person> Jackson <END>  coalition handily defeated  <START:person> Adams <END>  in 1828.
During the election,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's opponents referred to him as a "jackass".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out.
However, it later became the symbol for the Democratic Party when cartoonist  <START:person> Thomas Nast <END>  popularized it.
The campaign was very much a personal one.
As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events.
Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's wife  <START:person> Rachel <END>  of bigamy.
Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794).
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife.
 <START:person> Rachel <END>  died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve.
He blamed the  <START:person> Adams <END>  campaigners for her death.
"May God Almighty forgive her murderers," he swore at her funeral.
"I never can."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards or morality.
(He was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation work.)
Presidency 1829–1837.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's name has been associated with the spread of democracy in terms of the passing of political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties.
"The Age of Jackson" shaped the national agenda and American politics.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's philosophy as President followed much in the same line as  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> , advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency held a high moralistic tone; having as a planter himself agrarian sympathies, a limited view of states rights and the federal government.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values.
When South Carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.
On March 4, 1829,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was the first President to invite the public to attend the White House ball honoring his first inauguration.
Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes.
The crowd became so large that  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken.
Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President.
The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's raucous populism earned him the nickname "King Mob".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that the president's authority was derived from the people and the presidential office was above party politics.
Instead of choosing party favorites,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  chose "plain, businessmen" whom he intended to control.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  chose  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  as Secretary of State,  <START:person> John Eaton <END>  Secretary of War,  <START:person> Samuel Ingham <END>  Secretary of Treasury,  <START:person> John Branch <END>  Secretary of Navy,  <START:person> John Berrien <END>  as Attorney General, and  <START:person> William T. Barry <END>  as postmaster general.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's first choice of Cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip, especially between Eaton, Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> , and  <START:person> Van Buren <END> .
By the Spring of 1831, only  <START:person> Barry <END>  remained, while the rest of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's cabinet had been discharged.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's following cabinet selections worked better together.
 <START:person> Eaton <END>  affair.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his first years in office responding to what came to be known as the  <START:person> Eaton <END>  affair.
Vicious Washington D.C. gossip circulated among  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Cabinet members and their wives including Vice President  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> 's wife Floride concerning Secretary of War  <START:person> John H. Eaton <END>  and his wife  <START:person> Peggy <END> .
Bitter rumors spread that  <START:person> Peggy <END>  was loose in her morals while working at her father's tavern when her naval officer husband was away at sea.
After  <START:person> Peggy <END> 's husband died at sea, both  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and  <START:person> Peggy <END>  were criticized for their perceived early marriage.
Initially  <START:person> Jackson <END>  thought that  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  was behind the gossip, but then he eventually concluded  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  was responsible for spreading the rumors.
Both  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  defended  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and his wife  <START:person> Peggy <END> , however  <START:person> Calhoun <END> 's wife  <START:person> Floride <END>  and the wives of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's pro-Calhoun Cabinet members publicly shunned both  <START:person> Eaton <END>  and  <START:person> Peggy <END> .
 <START:person> Van Buren <END> ,  <START:person> Eaton <END> , and  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  resigned office over the affair while  <START:person> Jackson <END>  dismissed the rest of his pro-Calhoun cabinet members except Postmaster  <START:person> William T. Barry <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  nominated  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  to be Minister to England, however,  <START:person> Calhoun <END> 's supporters in the Senate blocked the nomination giving  <START:person> Calhoun <END> , who had continued to be Vice President and President of the Senate until December 1832, the deciding vote against  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  and blocked the nomination.
 <START:person> Calhoun <END>  publically castigated and boasted that  <START:person> Van Buren <END> 's political career was over stating the defeated nomination would "...kill him, sir, kill dead.
He will never kick, sir, never kick."
This rumor however proved to be false as  <START:person> Van Buren <END> , who played a leading role in the  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's unofficial Kitchen Cabinet, allied with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and became  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's successor and Vice Presidential candidate in 1832.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also acquired the "Globe" paper that was sympathetic with the  <START:person> Jackson <END>  administration.
Indian removal policy.
Throughout his two terms in office, lasting eight years,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  made approximately 70 treaties with native American tribes both in the South and the Northwest.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked a new era in Indian-Anglo American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates.
The southern tribes included the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Seminole and the Cherokee.
The northwest tribes include the Chippewa, Ottawa, and the Potawatomi.
Though conflict between Indians and American settlers took place in the north and in the south, the problem was worse in the south where the Indian populations were larger.
Indian wars broke out repeatedly, often when native tribes, especially the Muscogee and Seminole Indians, refused to abide by the treaties for various reasons.
The Second Seminole War, started in December 1835, lasted over six years finally ending in August 1842 under President  <START:person> John Tyler <END> .
Though relations between Europeans (and later Americans) and Indians were always complicated, they grew increasingly complicated once American settlements began pushing further west in the years after the American Revolution.
Often these relations were peaceful, though they increasingly grew tense and sometimes even violent, both on the part of American settlers and the Indians.
From  <START:person> George Washington <END>  to  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END> , the problem was typically ignored or dealt with lightly; though by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's time the earlier policy had grown unsustainable.
The problem was especially acute in the south (in particular the lands near the state of Georgia), where Indian populations were larger, denser, and more Americanized than those of the north.
As such, there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the problem, and out of this developed a policy to relocate certain Indian populations.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , never one known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency.
This contrasted from his immediate predecessor, President  <START:person> John Q. Adams <END> , who tended to follow the policy of his own predecessors, that of letting the problem play itself out with minimal intervention.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency thus took place in a new era in Indian-Anglo American relations, in that it marked federal action and a policy of relocation.
As such, during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency, Indian relations between the Southern tribes and the state governments had reached a critical juncture.
In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  advocated land west of the Mississippi River be set aside for Indian tribes.
Congress had been developing its own Indian relocation bill, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had many supporters in both the Senate and House who agreed with his goal.
On May 26, 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed it into law.
The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.
The passage of the bill was  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's first successful legislative triumph and marked the Democratic party's emergence into American political society.
The passage of the act was especially popular in the South where population growth and the discovery of gold on Cherokee land had increased pressure on tribal lands.
The state of Georgia became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 U.S. Supreme Court decision ("Worcester v. Georgia").
In that decision, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice  <START:person> John Marshall <END> , in writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  is frequently, though incorrectly, attributed with the following response: " <START:person> John Marshall <END>  has made his decision, now let him enforce it".
The quote originated in 1863 from  <START:person> Horace Greeley <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used the Georgia crisis to broker an agreement whereby the Cherokee leaders agreed to a removal treaty.
A group of Cherokees led by  <START:person> John Ridge <END>  negotiated the Treaty of New Echota with  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's representatives.
Ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the Cherokee Nation, and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate.
A group of Cherokees petitioned in protest of the proposed removal, though this wasn't taken up by the Supreme Court or the U.S. Congress, in part due to delays and timing.
The treaty was enforced by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's successor,  <START:person> Van Buren <END> , who sent 7,000 troops to carry out the relocation policy.
Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began.
It was subsequent to this that as many as 4,000 Cherokees died on the "Trail of Tears".
By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.
All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves.
Their methods earned them the title of the "Five Civilized Tribes".
More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's administration, though a few Cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high Smoky Mountains along the North Carolina and Tennessee border.
Initiated reforms.
BEP engraved portrait of  <START:person> Jackson <END>  as President.
In an effort to purge the government from corruption of previous administrations,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments.
During  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's tenure in office, large amounts of public money were put in the hands of public officials.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , who believed appointees should be hired by merit, withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Postmaster  <START:person> Barry <END>  resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  replaced  <START:person> Barry <END>  with  <START:person> Amos Kendall <END> , who went on to implement much needed reforms in the Postal Service.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  repeatedly called for the abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President.
In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term.
So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress."
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's time in the presidency as saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents.
The Service Pension Act of 1832, for instance, provided pensions to veterans “even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need,” while an Act of July 1836 enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband’s pensions.
Rotation in office and spoils system.
Upon assuming the presidency in 1829  <START:person> Jackson <END>  enforced the "Tenure of Office Act", passed earlier into law by President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  declared that rotation of appointments in political office was "a leading principle in the republican creed".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  noted, "In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy.
Opposed to this view however, were  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's supporters who in order to strengthen party loyalty wanted to give the posts to other party members.
In practice, this would have meant the continuation of the patronage system by replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists.
The number of federal office holders removed by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  were exaggerated by his opponents;  <START:person> Jackson <END>  only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , however, did use his image and presidential power to award his loyal Democratic Party followers by granting them federal office appointments.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's democratic approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office.
Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership  <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated "If he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me."
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's rotation of office theory generated what was later to be called the spoils system, a practice that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  never personally justified.
The political realities of Washington, however, did in the end force  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations.
Historians believe that  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics.
Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington proved to be difficult such as the New York Customs House, the Postal Service, the Departments of Navy and War, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had enormously increased in the past two decades.
Other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices, forced political party campaign participation, and collection of assessments, did not take place until after  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency.
During  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency, those in opposition to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's purging of office holders, formed the Whig Party, calling  <START:person> Jackson <END>  "King  <START:person> Andrew <END>  I" having feared his military background, and named their party after the English paliamentary Whigs who opposed eighteenth century British monarchy.
Nullification crisis.
Another notable crisis during  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's period of office was the "Nullification Crisis", or "secession crisis", of 1828 – 1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs.
Critics alleged that high tariffs (the "Tariff of Abominations") on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South.
Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.
The issue came to a head when Vice President  <START:person> Calhoun <END> , in the South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, South Carolina, that it had the right to "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests.
Although  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  attempted to face down  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.
Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts.
 <START:person> Robert Hayne <END>  began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!"
– a clear challenge to  <START:person> Calhoun <END> .
 <START:person> Calhoun <END>  clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"
At the first Democratic National Convention, which was privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet,  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  broke from each other politically and  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  replaced  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  as  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's running mate in the 1832 presidential election.
In December 1832,  <START:person> Calhoun <END>  resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.
In response to South Carolina's nullification claim,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  vowed to send troops to South Carolina to enforce the laws.
In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers", stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed".
South Carolina, the President declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution ... forms a "government" not a league ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  asked Congress to pass a "Force Bill" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by  <START:person> Clay <END>  agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff.
The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed both.
The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance.
The Force  <START:person> Bill <END>  became moot because it was no longer needed.
On May 1, 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and disunion and southern confederacy the real object.
The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question."
Foreign affairs.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took office in 1829 spoliation claims, or compensation demands for the capture of American ships and sailors, dating from the Napoleonic era, caused strained relations between the U.S. and French governments.
The French Navy had captured and sent American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules.
According to Secretary of State  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  the relations between the U.S. and France was "hopeless".
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Minister to France  <START:person> William C. Rives <END> , however, through diplomacy was able to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on July 4, 1831 that would award the U.S. ₣ 25,000,000 ($5,000,000) in damages.
The French government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties.
The French king  <START:person> Louis Philippe <END>  I and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies.
By 1834 the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's ire and he became impatient.
In his December 1834 State of the Union address  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was "wholly disappointed" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France.
Feeling insulted by  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's words the French people demanded an apology.
In his December 1835 State of the Union Address  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment.
The French government accepted  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's statements as sincere and in February 1836 American reparations were finally paid.
In addition to France, the  <START:person> Jackson <END>  administration successfully settled spoliation claims with Denmark, Portugal, and Spain.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with Russia, Spain, Turkey, Great Britain, and Siam.
Under the treaty of Great Britain American trade was reopened in the West Indies.
The trade agreement with Siam was Americas first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country.
As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , however, was unsuccessful in opening trade with China and Japan.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's agent in Texas, Colonel  <START:person> Anthony Butler <END> , suggested to take Texas over militarily but  <START:person> Jackson <END>  refused.
 <START:person> Butler <END>  was later replaced toward the end of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's presidency.
Bank veto and Election of 1832.
In 1816 the Second Bank of the United States was charted by President  <START:person> James Madison <END>  to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812.
In 1823 President  <START:person> James Monroe <END>  appointed  <START:person> Nicholas Biddle <END> , the Bank's third and last executive, to run the bank.
In January 1832  <START:person> Biddle <END> , on advice from his friends, submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter four years before the original 20 year charter was to end.
 <START:person> Biddle <END> 's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , believing that Bank was fundamentally a corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners, vetoed the bill.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  stated the Bank made "the rich richer and the potent more powerful."
The National Republican Party immediately made  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto of the Bank a political issue attempting to undermine  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's political opponents castigated  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto as "the very slang of the leveller and demagogue" believing  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.
During the 1832 Presidential Election the rechartering of the Second National Bank became the primary issue.
The election also demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period.
The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, in May 1832 nominated  <START:person> Jackson <END>  of Tennessee and  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  of New York.
The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , senator from Kentucky and former Speaker of the House, and  <START:person> John Sergeant <END>  of Pennsylvania.
The Anti-Mason party, who had earlier held their convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated  <START:person> William Wirt <END>  of Maryland and  <START:person> Amos Elmaker <END>  of Pennsylvania; both  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and  <START:person> Clay <END>  were masons.
The two rival parties, however, proved to be no match for  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity and the Democratic Party's strong political networks known as "Hickory Clubs" in state and local organization.
Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's popularity.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D.C.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  won the election decisively by a landslide receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes.
 <START:person> Clay <END>  received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes.
 <START:person> Wirt <END>  received only 8 percent of the popular vote and 7 electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party folded.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.
Removal of deposits and censure.
In 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  removed federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation.
Three years later,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  issued the Specie Circular, an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins).
The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes, causing the Panic of 1837, which threw the national economy into a deep depression.
It took years for the economy to recover from the damage, however the bulk of the damage was blamed on  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> , who took office in 1837.
Whitehouse.gov notes, Basically the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of "boom and bust," which was following its regular pattern, but  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's financial measures contributed to the crash.
His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy bank credit, had swept the West.
To end this speculation,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with hard money--gold or silver.
In 1837 the panic began.
Hundreds of banks and businesses failed.
Thousands lost their lands.
For about five years the United States was wracked by the worst depression thus far in its history.—"Whitehouse.gov" official biography of  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  The U.S. Senate censured  <START:person> Jackson <END>  on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States.
The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Jackson-rival Senator  <START:person> Henry Clay <END> , which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
During the proceedings preceding the censure,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  called  <START:person> Clay <END>  "reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel", and the issue was highly divisive within the Senate, however the censure was approved 26–20 on March 28.
When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  supporters, led by  <START:person> Thomas Hart Benton <END> , who though he had once shot  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in a street fight, eventually became an ardent supporter of the president.
Attack and assassination attempt.
The first recorded physical attack on a U.S. president was directed at  <START:person> Jackson <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had ordered the dismissal of  <START:person> Robert B. Randolph <END>  from the navy for embezzlement.
On May 6, 1833,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  sailed on USS "Cygnet" to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of  <START:person> Mary Ball Washington <END> ,  <START:person> George Washington <END> 's mother.
During a stopover near Alexandria,  <START:person> Randolph <END>  appeared and struck the President.
He fled the scene chased by several members of  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's party, including the well-known writer  <START:person> Washington Irving <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  decided not to press charges.
On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative  <START:person> Warren R. Davis <END> ,  <START:person> Richard Lawrence <END> , an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired.
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired.
Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring.
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  was restrained, and legend says that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  attacked  <START:person> Lawrence <END>  with his cane.
Others present, including  <START:person> David Crockett <END> , restrained and disarmed  <START:person> Lawrence <END> .
 <START:person> Lawrence <END>  told doctors later his reasons for the shooting.
He blamed  <START:person> Jackson <END>  for the loss of his job.
He claimed that with the President dead, "money would be more plenty" (a reference to  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell".
Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English King—specifically,  <START:person> Richard III <END> , dead since 1485—and that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was his clerk.
He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.
Afterwards, due to public curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested.
Each time they performed perfectly.
Many believed that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had been protected by the same Providence that they believed also protected their young nation.
The incident became a part of the Jacksonian mythos.
Slavery controversies.
Anti-slavery tracts.
During the summer of 1835, controversy over slavery was rekindled throughout the nation, as had similarly taken place during the divisive 1819-1820 Missouri Compromise debates.
Northern abolitionists were sending anti-slavery tracts through the U.S. Postal system into the South.
Pro slavery Southerners objected believing the tracts were "incendiary literature" and demanded that the postal service unconditionally ban the sending of any anti-slavery tracts into the South.
On July 29, a mob of 300 conservatives broke into the Post Office in Charleston, South Carolina and proceeded to seize and destroy abolitionist tracts.
The Jackson Administration had Southern sympathies over slavery and was hostile to abolitionism.
However,  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who demanded sectional peace, desired to placate Southerners; at the same time resisting antislavery demands without ignoring the interests of Northern Democrats.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's Postmaster General  <START:person> Amos Kendall <END>  gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  angrily denounced Northern abolitionists and suggested that the names of abolitionist authors should be published.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> , who wanted the matter quickly resolved, also suggested the tracts be mailed only to subscribers.
In February 1836, Senator  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ,  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's former Vice President, authored a bill that would prohibit the sending of any anti-slavery tracts via the federal mail service.
The bill however failed to gain enough votes to pass in the House.
Many Southern postmasters, however, disregarded matters of federal law and simply refused to send the anti-slavery tracts.
Anti-slavery Congressional petitions.
In the same year another controversy took place, when abolitionists sent the U.S. House of Representatives petitions to end the slave trade and slavery in Washington D.C.
This infuriated pro-slavery Southerners, who attempted to prevent acknowledgement or discussion of the petitions.
On December 18, 1835 South Carolina congressman  <START:person> James H. Hammond <END>  strongly denounced abolitionists as "ignorant fanatics".
Northern Whigs objected that anti-slavery petitions were constitutional and should not be forbidden.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  wanted the issue of these petitions resolved quickly.
South Carolina Representative  <START:person> Henry L. Pinckney <END>  drafted and introduced a resolution that denounced the petitions as "sickly sentimentality", declared that Congress had no right to interfere with slavery, and tabled ("gag rule") all further anti-slavery petitions.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  leaders in Congress supported the measure, which was passed quickly and without any debate; temporarily suppressing pro-abolitionist activities in Congress.
Recognition of Republic of Texas.
In 1835, pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government; by May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military for the time being, establishing an independent Republic of Texas.
The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and annexation into the United States.
However,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was hesitant with recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election.
The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, while Democratic candidate  <START:person> Van Buren <END>  was elected President.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating a chargé d'affaires on the last day of his Presidency, March 3, 1837.
U.S. Exploring Expedition.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  initially opposed any federal exploration scientific expeditions during his first term in office.
The last scientific federally funded exploration expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823 led by  <START:person> Stephen H. Harriman <END>  on the Red River of the North.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's predecessor  <START:person> John Q. Adams <END>  attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration expedition in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort.
When  <START:person> Jackson <END>  assumed office in 1829 he pocketed  <START:person> Adam <END> 's expedition plans.
However, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END>  and the  <START:person> Lewis <END>  and Clark Expedition,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term.
On May 18, 1836  <START:person> Jackson <END>  signed a law creating and funding the oceanic United States Exploring Expedition.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  put Secretary of Navy  <START:person> Mahlon Dickerson <END>  in charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's term of office expired.
 <START:person> Dickerson <END>  however proved unfit for the task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, under the next President,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END> .
One Brig ship, the USS "Porpoise", later used in the expedition; having been laid down, built, and commissioned by Secretary  <START:person> Dickerson <END>  in May 1836, circumnavigated the world, explored and mapped the Southern Ocean, confirming the existence of the Antarctica continent.
Panic of 1837.
The national economy during the 1830s was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills.
In January 1835,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished.
However, reckless speculation in land and railroads caused what became known as the Panic of 1837.
Contributing factors included  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused Western Banks to relax their lending standards.
Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837, the Specie Circular, that mandated Western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, that transferred federal monies from Eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's "Specie Circular", although designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, led many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver.
The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States.
As a result the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased.
The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound.
Judicial appointments.
In total  <START:person> Jackson <END>  appointed 24 federal judges: six Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States and eighteen judges to the United States district courts.
Later life and death.
After serving two terms as president,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  retired to his Hermitage plantation in 1837.
He immediately began putting the Hermitage in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son,  <START:person> Andrew Jr <END> .
Although he suffered ill health,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  remained influential in both national and state politics.
He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, "I will die with the Union."
Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor,  <START:person> Martin Van Buren <END>  to repudiate the "Specie Circular".
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  died at his plantation on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic tuberculosis, dropsy, and heart failure.
According to a newspaper account from the "Boon Lick Times" read, "[he] fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed ... but he subsequently revived ... Gen.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  died at the Hermitage at 6 o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant.
When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach.
He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live."
In his will,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  left his entire estate to his adopted son,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members.
Family and personal life.
Shortly after  <START:person> Jackson <END>  first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with  <START:person> Rachel Stockley Donelson <END> , the widow of  <START:person> John Donelson <END> .
Here  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became acquainted with their daughter,  <START:person> Rachel Donelson Robards <END> .
At the time,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  was in an unhappy marriage with Captain  <START:person> Lewis Robards <END> ; he was subject to fits of jealous rage.
The two were separated in 1790.
According to  <START:person> Jackson <END> , he married  <START:person> Rachel <END>  after hearing that  <START:person> Robards <END>  had obtained a divorce.
However, the divorce had never been completed, making  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's marriage to  <START:person> Jackson <END>  bigamous and therefore invalid.
After the divorce was officially completed,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  and  <START:person> Jackson <END>  remarried in 1794.
To complicate matters further, evidence shows that  <START:person> Rachel <END>  had been living with  <START:person> Jackson <END>  and referred to herself as Mrs.  <START:person> Jackson <END>  before the petition for divorce was ever made.
It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.
The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for  <START:person> Jackson <END> , who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor.
By May 1806,  <START:person> Charles Dickinson <END>  had published an attack on  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from  <START:person> Jackson <END>  to a duel.
Since  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  was considered an expert shot,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  determined it would be best to let  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness;  <START:person> Jackson <END>  would wait and take careful aim at  <START:person> Dickinson <END> .
 <START:person> Dickinson <END>  did fire first, hitting  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in the chest.
Under the rules of dueling,  <START:person> Dickinson <END>  had to remain still as  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took aim and shot and killed him.
However, the bullet that struck  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled  <START:person> Jackson <END>  with a reputation as a fearful, violent, vengeful man.
He became a social outcast.
 <START:person> Rachel <END>  died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before  <START:person> Jackson <END>  took office as President.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  described her symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast."
After struggling for three days,  <START:person> Rachel <END>  finally died; a distraught  <START:person> Jackson <END>  had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body.
She had been under extreme stress during the election, and she never did well when  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was away at war or work.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  blamed  <START:person> John Quincy Adams <END>  for  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's death because the Whig campaign of 1828 had repeatedly attacked the circumstances for  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's wedding to  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave  <START:person> Adams <END> .
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  had three adopted sons:  <START:person> Theodore <END> , an Indian about whom little is known,  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , the son of  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's brother  <START:person> Severn Donelson <END> , and  <START:person> Lyncoya <END> , a Creek Indian orphan adopted by  <START:person> Jackson <END>  after the Creek War.
 <START:person> Lyncoya <END>  died of tuberculosis in 1828, at the age of sixteen.
The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children.
 <START:person> John Samuel Donelson <END> ,  <START:person> Daniel Smith Donelson <END>  and  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Donelson <END>  were the sons of  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's brother  <START:person> Samuel Donelson <END> , who died in 1804.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson Hutchings <END>  was  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's orphaned grand nephew.
 <START:person> Caroline Butler <END> ,  <START:person> Eliza Butler <END> ,  <START:person> Edward Butler <END> , and  <START:person> Anthony Butler <END>  were the orphaned children of  <START:person> Edward Butler <END> , a family friend.
They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.
The widower  <START:person> Jackson <END>  invited  <START:person> Rachel <END> 's niece  <START:person> Emily Donelson <END>  to serve as host at the White House.
 <START:person> Emily <END>  was married to  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Donelson <END> , who acted as  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the American Party ticket.
The relationship between the President and  <START:person> Emily <END>  became strained during the Petticoat affair, and the two became estranged for over a year.
They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House host.
 <START:person> Sarah Yorke Jackson <END> , the wife of  <START:person> Andrew Jackson Jr. <END> , became co-host of the White House in 1834.
It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady.
 <START:person> Sarah <END>  took over all hosting duties after  <START:person> Emily <END>  died from tuberculosis in 1836.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  used Rip Raps as a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.
Temperament.
 <START:person> Jackson <END> 's quick temper was notorious.
Brands says, "His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him and defamed even his wife,  <START:person> Rachel <END> .
He dueled in her defense and his own, suffering grievous wounds that left him with bullet fragments lodged about his body."
However,  <START:person> Remini <END>  is of the opinion that  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs.
Brands also notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper: On the last day of the presidency,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot  <START:person> Henry Clay <END>  or to hang  <START:person> John C. Calhoun <END> ."
Physical appearance.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a lean figure, standing at 6 feet, 1 inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64 kg) on average.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61.
He had penetrating deep blue eyes.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake.
Religious faith.
About a year after retiring the presidency,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  became a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a Freemason, having been initiated at Masonic Lodge, Harmony No. 1 in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee.
He was the only U.S. president to have been a Grandmaster of a State Lodge until  <START:person> Harry S. Truman <END>  in 1945.
His Masonic apron is on display in the Tennessee State Museum.
An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage.
 <START:person> Jackson <END>  on U.S. postage.
 <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on U.S. Postage more than the usual two or three times.
He died in 1845, but the U.S. Post Office did not release a postage stamp in his honor until 18 years after his death, with the issue of 1863, a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the 'Black Jack'.
In contrast, the first  <START:person> Warren G. Harding <END>  stamp was released only one month after his death,  <START:person> Lincoln <END> , one year exactly.
As  <START:person> Jackson <END>  was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait.
In all,  <START:person> Jackson <END>  has appeared on thirteen different U.S. postage stamps, more than that of most U.S. presidents; only Washington,  <START:person> Lincoln <END> , and  <START:person> Franklin <END>  (who was not a president) have appeared more often.
During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two Confederate postage stamps bearing  <START:person> Jackson <END> 's portrait, one a and the other a , both issued in 1863.
Popular culture depictions.
The actor  <START:person> Hugh Sothern <END>  played the character of General  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  in the 1938 film "The Buccaneer", and  <START:person> Charlton Heston <END>  played  <START:person> Andrew Jackson <END>  in the 1953 film, "The President's Lady" and the 1958 film, "The Buccaneer".
 <START:person> Basil Ruysdael <END>  played  <START:person> Jackson <END>  in Walt Disney's 1955 " <START:person> Davy Crockett <END> " TV miniseries and subsequent film release.

auto; font-size:95%;clear:both;"  Affix  An affix (in modern sense) is a morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word.
Affixes may be derivational, like English "-ness" and "pre-", or inflectional, like English plural "-s" and past tense "-ed".
They are bound morphemes by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be separable affixes.
Affixation is, thus, the linguistic process speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.
Positional categories of affixes.
Affixes are divided into plenty of categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem.
"Prefix" and "suffix" are extremely common terms.
"Infix" and "circumfix" are less so, as they are not important in European languages.
The other terms are uncommon.
"Prefix" and "suffix" may be subsumed under the term "adfix" in contrast to "infix."
When marking text for interlinear glossing, as in the third column in the chart above, simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens.
Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets.
Reduplication is often shown with a tilde.
Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash.
Lexical affixes.
"Lexical affixes" (or "semantic affixes") are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as incorporated nouns within verbs and as elements of compound nouns.
In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form.
Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.
Lexical affixes are relatively rare.
The Wakashan, Salishan, and Chimakuan languages all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest of the North America.
The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings.
Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of Northern Straits Saanich written in the Saanich orthography and in Americanist notation: Lexical suffixes when compared with free nouns often have a more generic or general meaning.
For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such "saltwater", "whitewater", etc.).
In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become grammaticalized to various degrees.
Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs.
Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic arguments just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns.
 <START:person> Gerdts <END>  (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the Halkomelem language (the word order here is verb–subject–object): In sentence (1), the verb "wash" is šak’ʷətəs where šak’ʷis the root and -ət and -əs are inflectional suffixes.
The subject "the woman" is łə słeniʔ and the object "the baby" is łə qeq.
In this sentence, "the baby" is a free noun.
(The niʔ here is an auxiliary, which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)
In sentence (2), "baby" does not appear as a free noun.
Instead it appears as the lexical suffix -əyəł which is affixed to the verb root šk’ʷ(which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here).
Note how the lexical suffix is neither "the baby" (definite) nor "a baby" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.
Orthographic affixes.
In orthography, the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters.
For example,  <START:person> Maya <END>  glyphs are generally compounds of a "main sign" and smaller "affixes" joined at its margins.
These are called "prefixes, superfixes, postfixes," and "subfixes" according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph.
A small glyph placed inside another is called an "infix."
Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the Indic alphabets.
For example, the Tibetan alphabet utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.

</dl>   <START:person> Augustin-Louis Cauchy  Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy <END>  (]; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician reputed as a pioneer of analysis.
He was one of the first to state and prove theorems of calculus rigorously, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors.
He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra.
A profound mathematician,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors.
His writings range widely in mathematics and mathematical physics.
"More concepts and theorems have been named for  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy)."
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks.
He was a devout Roman Catholic, strict Bourbon royalist, and a close associate of the Jesuit order.
Biography.
Youth and education.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was the son of  <START:person> Louis François Cauchy <END>  (1760–1848) and  <START:person> Marie-Madeleine Desestre <END> .
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had two brothers,  <START:person> Alexandre Laurent Cauchy <END>  (1792–1857), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and  <START:person> Eugene François Cauchy <END>  (1802–1877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  married  <START:person> Aloise de Bure <END>  in 1818.
She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's works.
By her he had two daughters,  <START:person> Marie Françoise Alicia <END>  (1819) and  <START:person> Marie Mathilde <END>  (1823).
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's father ( <START:person> Louis François Cauchy <END> ) was a high official in the Parisian Police of the New Régime.
He lost his position because of the French Revolution (July 14, 1789) that broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born.
The  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  family survived the revolution and the following Reign of Terror (1794) by escaping to Arcueil, where  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  received his first education, from his father.
After the execution of Robespierre (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris.
There  <START:person> Louis-François Cauchy <END>  found himself a new bureaucratic job, and quickly moved up the ranks.
When  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END>  came to power (1799),  <START:person> Louis-François Cauchy <END>  was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under Laplace (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics).
The famous mathematician Lagrange was also no stranger in the  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  family.
On Lagrange's advice,  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  was enrolled in the École Centrale du Panthéon, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802.
Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and Humanities.
In spite of these successes,  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the École Polytechnique.
In 1805 he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam, and he was admitted.
One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education.
The school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting.
Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the École des Ponts et Chaussées (School for Bridges and Roads).
He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors.
Engineering days.
After finishing school in 1810,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where  <START:person> Napoleon <END>  intended to build a naval base.
Here  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END>  stayed for three years, and although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the "Première Classe" (First Class) of the Institut de France.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's first two manuscripts (on polyhedra) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of conic sections) was rejected.
In September 1812, now 23 years old, after becoming ill from overwork,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  returned to Paris.
Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position.
Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior.
The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric functions, the symmetric group and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations).
He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815.
In 1815  <START:person> Napoleon <END>  was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king  <START:person> Louis XVIII <END>  took the restoration in hand.
The Académie des Sciences was re-established in March 1816;  <START:person> Lazare Carnot <END>  and  <START:person> Gaspard Monge <END>  were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them.
The reaction by  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's peers was harsh; they considered his acceptance of membership of the Academy an outrage, and  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  thereby created many enemies in scientific circles.
Professor at École Polytechnique.
In November 1815,  <START:person> Louis Poinsot <END> , who was an associate professor at the École Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship.
One of his great successes at that time was the proof of  <START:person> Fermat <END> 's polygonal number theorem.
However, the fact that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons, doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot.
He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the École Polytechnique.
In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was promoted to full professor.
When  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents.
His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride,  <START:person> Aloïse de Bure <END> , five years his junior.
The  <START:person> de Bure <END>  family were printers and booksellers, and published most of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's works.
 <START:person> Aloïse <END>  and  <START:person> Augustin <END>  were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice.
In 1819 the couple's first daughter,  <START:person> Marie Françoise Alicia <END> , was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter,  <START:person> Marie Mathilde <END> .
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had two brothers:  <START:person> Alexandre Laurent Cauchy <END> , who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and  <START:person> Eugène François Cauchy <END> , a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.
The conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  perfectly.
In 1824  <START:person> Louis XVIII <END>  died, and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
During these years  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another.
He received cross appointments at the Collège de France, and the Faculté des Sciences of the University.
In exile.
In July 1830 France underwent another revolution.
 <START:person> Charles X <END>  fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king  <START:person> Louis-Philippe <END>  (of the House of Orléans).
Riots, in which uniformed students of the École Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's home in Paris.
These events marked a turning point in  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> , shaken by the fall of the government, and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind.
He spent a short time at Fribourg in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime.
He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required.
In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the King of Sardinia (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him.
He taught in Turin during 1832–1833.
In 1831, he had been elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
In August 1833  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  left Turin for Prague, to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old  <START:person> Duke of Bordeaux Henri d'Artois <END>  (1820–1883), the exiled Crown  <START:person> Prince <END>  and grandson of  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
As a professor of the École Polytechnique,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material.
The young  <START:person> Duke <END>  had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch.
Although  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.
During his civil engineering days,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of telling his pupil this; with great malice, the young  <START:person> Duke <END>  went about saying that Mister  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  started his career in the sewers of Paris.
His role as tutor lasted until the  <START:person> Duke <END>  became eighteen years old, in September 1838.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics.
The only good that came out of this episode was  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's promotion to  <START:person> Baron <END> , a title that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  set great store by.
In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was finally reunited with his family, after four years of exile.
Last years.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838.
He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance.
However, he desperately wanted to regain a formal position in Parisian science.
In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau des Longitudes.
This Bureau had some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members.
Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could "forget" about the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it.
The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea – mainly the longitudinal coordinate, since latitude is easily determined from the position of the sun.
Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.
In November 1839  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with.
Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election.
For four years  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers.
Still  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics.
In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy.
He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by  <START:person> John Colson <END> .
The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was finally replaced by  <START:person> Poinsot <END> .
Throughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of Church and State.
After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally.
He lent his prestige and knowledge to the École Normale Écclésiastique, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges.
He also took part in the founding of the Institut Catholique.
The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France.
These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who, on the whole, supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution.
When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Collège de France in 1843,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  applied for it, but got just three out of 45 votes.
The year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France.
King  <START:person> Louis-Philippe <END> , fearful of sharing the fate of  <START:person> Louis XVI <END> , fled to England.
The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy.
On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Faculté de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy.
After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of  <START:person> Louis Napoleon Bonaparte <END> , nephew of  <START:person> Napoleon Bonaparte <END> , and son of  <START:person> Napoleon <END> 's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland.
Soon (early 1852) the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name  <START:person> Napoleon III <END> .
Not unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors.
Not always does history repeat itself, however, because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67.
He received the Last Rites and died at 4 a.m. on May 23, 1857.
His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.
Work.
Early work.
The genius of  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was illustrated in his simple solution of the problem of Apollonius—describing a circle touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of  <START:person> Euler <END> 's formula on polyhedra in 1811, and in several other elegant problems.
More important is his memoir on wave propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series, where he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series.
In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers.
He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.
Wave theory, mechanics, elasticity.
In the theory of light he worked on Fresnel's wave theory and on the dispersion and polarization of light.
He also contributed significant research in mechanics, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter.
He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media.
He introduced a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the Cauchy stress tensor.
In elasticity, he originated the theory of stress, and his results are nearly as valuable as those of  <START:person> Siméon Poisson <END> .
Number theory.
Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the  <START:person> Fermat <END>  polygonal number theorem.
Complex functions.
Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory.
The first pivotal theorem proved by  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , now known as "Cauchy's integral theorem", was the following: where "f"("z") is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve "C" (contour) lying in the complex plane.
The "contour integral" is taken along the contour "C".
The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  presented to the Académie des Sciences (then still called "First Class of the Institute") on August 11, 1814.
In full form the theorem was given in 1825.
The 1825 paper is seen by many as  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's most important contribution to mathematics.
In 1826  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  gave a formal definition of a residue of a function.
This concept regards functions that have poles—isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity.
If the complex-valued function "f"("z") can be expanded in the neighborhood of a singularity "a" as where φ("z") is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then "f" is said to have a pole of order "n" in the point "a".
If "n" = 1, the pole is called simple.
The coefficient "B"1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function "f" at "a".
If "f" is non-singular at "a" then the residue of "f" is zero at "a".
Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to, where we replaced "B"1 by the modern notation of the residue.
In 1831, while in Turin,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin.
In the first he proposed the formula now known as  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's integral formula, where "f"("z") is analytic on "C" and within the region bounded by the contour "C" and the complex number "a" is somewhere in this region.
The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise.
Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at "z" = "a".
In the second paper he presented the residue theorem, where the sum is over all the "n" poles of "f"("z") on and within the contour "C".
These results of  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers.
For quite some time, contemporaries of  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated.
Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with  <START:person> Pierre-Alphonse Laurent <END>  being the first mathematician, besides  <START:person> Cauchy <END> , making a substantial contribution (his Laurent series published in 1843).
Cours d'Analyse.
In his book "Cours d'Analyse"  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  stressed the importance of rigor in analysis.
"Rigor" in this case meant the rejection of the principle of "Generality of algebra" (of earlier authors such as  <START:person> Euler <END>  and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and infinitesimals.
 <START:person> Judith Grabiner <END>  wrote  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was "the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe."
The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and formula_6 arguments were introduced into Calculus.
Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: "The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself."
 <START:person> M. Barany <END>  claims that the École mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's better judgement .
 <START:person> Gilain <END>  notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to "Analyse Algébrique" was reduced in 1825,  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus.
 <START:person> Laugwitz <END>  (1989) and  <START:person> Benis-Sinaceur <END>  (1973) point out that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero.
There has been a vast body of literature written about  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's notion of "infinitesimally small quantities", arguing they lead from everything from the usual "epsilontic" definitions or to the notions of non-standard analysis.
The consensus is that  <START:person> Cauchy <END>  omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used.
 <START:person> Taylor <END> 's theorem.
He was the first to prove  <START:person> Taylor <END> 's theorem rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder.
He wrote a textbook (see the illustration) for his students at the École Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible.
In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught.
Also  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book: Cauchy condensation test.
In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook.
In spite of these,  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods; thus one of his theorems was exposed to a "counter-example" by  <START:person> Abel <END> , later fixed by the introduction of the notion of uniform continuity.
Argument principle, stability.
In a paper published in 1855, two years before  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the "Argument Principle" in many modern textbooks on complex analysis.
In modern control theory textbooks, the Cauchy argument principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist stability criterion, which can be used to predict the stability of negative feedback amplifier and negative feedback control systems.
Thus  <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.
Output.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was very productive, in number of papers second only to  <START:person> Leonhard Euler <END> .
It took almost a century to collect all his writings into 27 large volumes: His greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced; these are mainly embodied in his three great treatises: His other works include: Politics and religious beliefs.
 <START:person> Augustin-Louis Cauchy <END>  grew up in the house of a staunch royalist.
This made his father flee with the family to Arcueil during the French Revolution.
Their life there during that time was apparently hard;  <START:person> Augustin-Louis <END> 's father,  <START:person> Louis François <END> , spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period.
A paragraph from an undated letter from  <START:person> Louis François <END>  to his mother in Rouen says: We never had more than a half pound of bread — and sometimes not even that.
This we supplement with little supply of hard crackers and rice that we are allotted.
Otherwise, we are getting along quite well, which is the important thing and goes to show that human beings can get by with little.
I should tell you that for my children's pap I still have a bit of fine flour, made from wheat that I grew on my own land.
I had three bushels, and I also have a few pounds of potato starch.
It is as white as snow and very good, too, especially for very young children.
It, too, was grown on my own land.
In any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of  <START:person> Charles X. <END> 
He was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint  <START:person> Vincent de Paul <END> .
He also had links to the Society of  <START:person> Jesus <END>  and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so.
His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for  <START:person> Charles Hermite <END>  during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic.
It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Potato Famine.
His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues.
He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed.
 <START:person> Niels Henrik Abel <END>  called him a "bigoted Catholic" and added he was "mad and there is nothing that can be done about him", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END> 's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when  <START:person> Guglielmo Libri Carucci <END>  dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause.
When  <START:person> Libri <END>  was accused of stealing books he was replaced by  <START:person> Joseph Liouville <END>  rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy.
Another dispute with political overtones concerned  <START:person> Jean Marie Constant Duhamel <END>  and a claim on inelastic shocks.
 <START:person> Cauchy <END>  was later shown, by  <START:person> Jean-Victor Poncelet <END> , to be wrong.
Aimery of Jerusalem  Aimery (Latin "Aimericus"; 1145 – 1 April 1205), born  <START:person> Aimery <END>  of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> , was the first King of Cyprus (1194–1205) and tenth King of Jerusalem (1197–1205).
He was an older brother of  <START:person> Guy of Lusignan <END> .
Older scholarship mistook the names Aimery and  <START:person> Amalric <END>  ( <START:person> Amaury <END> ) as variant spellings of the same name, so these historians erroneously added numbers for kings  <START:person> Amalric <END>  I (1163–74) and  <START:person> Amalric <END>  II (actually Aimery).
Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king.
Confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries.
The  <START:person> Lusignan <END>  family was noted for its many Crusaders.
Aimery and Guy were sons of  <START:person> Hugh VIII <END>  of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> , who had himself campaigned in the Holy Land in the 1160s.
After being expelled from Poitou by their overlord,  <START:person> Richard <END>  the Lion-hearted, for the murder of  <START:person> Patrick <END>  of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury,  <START:person> Aimery <END>  arrived in Palestine c. 1174, Guy possibly later.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  married  <START:person> Eschiva <END> , daughter of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  of Ibelin.
He then took service with  <START:person> Agnes of Courtenay <END> , wife of  <START:person> Reginald <END>  of Sidon and mother of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  IV of Jerusalem.
The pro-Ibelin "Chronicle of Ernoul" later claimed that he was her lover, but it is likely that she and  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  IV were attempting to separate him from the political influence of his wife's family.
He was appointed Constable of Jerusalem soon after 22 April 1179.
 <START:person> Guy <END>  married the king's widowed older sister, Sibylla of Jerusalem in 1180, and so gained a claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  was among those captured with his brother after the disastrous  <START:person> Battle of Hattin <END>  in 1187.
In 1194, on the death of Guy, he became King of Cyprus.
By his first wife,  <START:person> Eschiva <END>  of  <START:person> Ibelin <END> , he was the father of  <START:person> Hugh <END>  I of Cyprus and was crowned in Nicosia on 22 September 1197.
After  <START:person> Eschiva <END> 's death in October 1197 he married  <START:person> Isabella <END> , the daughter of  <START:person> Amalric <END>  of Jerusalem by his second marriage, and became King of Jerusalem in right of his wife and was crowned at Acre in January 1198.
This was only possible, because the candidacy for the crown of  <START:person> Aimery <END> , who was a vassal of Roman-German Emperor  <START:person> Henry <END>  VI., was supported by the German crusaders.
In 1198, at the end of the Crusade of 1197, he was able to procure a five years' truce with the Muslims, owing to the struggle between  <START:person> Saladin <END> 's brothers and his sons for the inheritance of his territories.
The truce was disturbed by raids on both sides, but in 1204 it was renewed for six years.
Many members of the royal family died in rapid succession in early 1205, including  <START:person> Aimery <END>  himself.
 <START:person> Aimery <END> 's two older sons, Guy and John, boys of about eight years of age, died early in 1205.
 <START:person> Aimery <END>  died of dysentery (allegedly brought on by "a surfeit of white mullet") or even poisoned at Saint Jean d'Acre on 1 April 1205, just after his son  <START:person> Aimery <END>  and four days before his wife, and was buried at Saint Sophia, Nicosia.
The kingdom of Cyprus passed to  <START:person> Hugh <END> , his only surviving son, while the Kingdom of Jerusalem passed to  <START:person> Maria <END> , the daughter of  <START:person> Isabella <END>  by her previous marriage with  <START:person> Conrad of Montferrat <END> .
Wives and children.
His first wife, married before 29 October 1174, was Eschiva of Ibelin (c.
1160 – Cyprus in Winter 1196–1197), daughter of  <START:person> Baldwin <END>  of Ibelin and first wife  <START:person> Richilde de Bethsan <END>  or  <START:person> Bessan <END> .
They had six children: His second wife was  <START:person> Queen Isabella <END>  of Jerusalem, married January 1198 in Acre.
They had three children:   <START:person> Ambroise  Ambroise <END> , sometimes  <START:person> Ambroise <END>  of Normandy, (flourished c. 1190) was a  <START:person> Norman <END>  poet and chronicler of the Third Crusade, author of a work called "L'Estoire de la guerre sainte", which describes in rhyming Old French verse the adventures of  <START:person> Richard Coeur de Lion <END>  as a crusader.
The poem is known to us only through one Vatican manuscript, and long escaped the notice of historians.
The credit for detecting its value belongs to  <START:person> Gaston Paris <END> , although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the "Monumenta Germaniae Historica", who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885).
 <START:person> Ambroise <END>  followed  <START:person> Richard <END>  I as a noncombatant, and not improbably as a court-minstrel.
He speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at Messina, in Cyprus, at the siege of Acre, and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.
 <START:person> Ambroise <END>  is surprisingly accurate in his chronology; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his pilgrimage.
He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention.
He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the Saracens, against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the "Polein" party which supported  <START:person> Conrad <END>  of Montferrat against Guy of  <START:person> Lusignan <END> .
He is rather to be treated as a biographer than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects.
Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190–1192 in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
Books 2–6 of the "Itinerarium Regis Ricardi", a Latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by  <START:person> Richard <END> , a canon of Holy Trinity, London, are closely related to  <START:person> Ambroise <END> 's poem.
They were formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which  <START:person> Ambroise <END>  based his work, but that can no longer be maintained.
American English  American English, or U.S. English, is a set of dialects of the English language used mostly in the United States.
Approximately two-thirds of the world's native speakers of English live in the U.S. The variety of American English that is considered by many speakers to be the most free from regional, ethnic, or cultural distinctions is the dialect known as General American.
English is the most widely spoken language in the United States.
English is the common language used by the federal government and is considered the "de facto" language of the country because of its widespread use.
English has been given official status by 30 of the 50 state governments.
As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States District Court for the territory.
The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization.
The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Since then, American English has been influenced by the languages of West Africa, the Native American population, German, Irish, Spanish, and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the U.S. Phonology.
Compared with English as spoken in England, North American English is more homogeneous.
Some distinctive accents can be found on the East Coast (for example, in eastern New England, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore) partly because these areas were in close contact with England and imitated prestigious varieties of English at a time when these were undergoing changes.
In addition, many speech communities on the East Coast have existed in their present locations for centuries, while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing United States and developed a far more general linguistic pattern.
Studies on historical usage of English in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply evolve from period British English, but rather retained many archaic features contemporary British English has since lost.
Most North American speech is rhotic, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was rhotic.
Rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of Hiberno-English, West Country English and Scottish English.
In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter "r" is a postalveolar approximant [ɹ̠] or retroflex approximant [ɻ] rather than a trill or a tap (as often heard, for example, in Scotland or India).
A unique "bunched tongue" variant of the approximant "r" sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.
The loss of syllable-final "r" in North America, known as non-rhoticity, is confined mostly to the accents of eastern New England, New York City and surrounding areas and the coastal portions of the South, and African American Vernacular English.
In rural tidewater Virginia and eastern New England, 'r' is non-rhotic in accented (such as "bird", "work", "first", "birthday") as well as unaccented syllables, although this is declining among the younger generation of speakers.
Dropping of syllable-final "r" sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if "r" is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant (for example, many North Americans drop the first 'r' in "particular").
In England, the lost "r" was often changed into [ə] (schwa), giving rise to a new class of falling diphthongs.
Furthermore, the "er" sound of "fur or "butter, is realized in AmE as a monophthongal r-colored vowel (stressed [ɝ] or unstressed [ɚ] as represented in the IPA).
This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech.
Some other English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate: On the other hand, North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of English speech: Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include: Vocabulary.
North America has given the English lexicon many thousands of words, meanings, and phrases.
Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally.
Creation of an American lexicon.
The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the Native American languages.
Examples of such names are "opossum, raccoon, squash" and "moose" (from Algonquian).
Other Native American loanwords, such as "wigwam" or "moccasin", describe articles in common use among Native Americans.
The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, "cookie", "cruller", "stoop", and "pit" (of a fruit) from Dutch; "angst, kindergarten, sauerkraut" from German, "levee, portage" ("carrying of boats or goods") and (probably) "gopher" from French; "barbecue, stevedore, and rodeo" from Spanish.
Among the earliest and most notable regular "English" additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, "run, branch, fork, snag, bluff, gulch, neck" (of the woods), "barrens, bottomland, notch, knob, riffle, rapids, watergap, cutoff, trail, timberline" and "divide".
Already existing words such as "creek, slough, sleet" and (in later use) "watershed" received new meanings that were unknown in England.
Other noteworthy American toponyms are found among loanwords; for example, "prairie, butte" (French); "bayou" (Choctaw via Louisiana French); "coulee" (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); "canyon, mesa, arroyo" (Spanish); "vlei, skate, kill" (Dutch, Hudson Valley).
The word "corn", used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant "Zea mays", the most important crop in the U.S., originally named "Indian corn" by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as "grain".
Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by "barn" (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and "team" (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms "range, (corn) crib, truck, elevator, sharecropping" and "feedlot."
"Ranch," later applied to a house style, derives from Mexican Spanish; most Spanish contributions came after the War of 1812, with the opening of the West.
Among these are, other than toponyms, "chaps" (from "chaparreras), plaza, lasso, bronco, , rodeo;" examples of "English" additions from the cowboy era are "bad man, maverick, chuck" ("food") and "Boot Hill;" from the California Gold Rush came such idioms as "hit pay dirt" or "strike it rich."
The word "blizzard" probably originated in the West.
A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb "belittle" and the noun "bid," both first used in writing by  <START:person> Thomas Jefferson <END> .
With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts "(land office, lot, outlands, waterfront," the verbs "locate" and "relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision)," types of property "(log cabin, adobe" in the 18th century; "frame house, apartment, tenement house, shack, " in the 19th century; "project, condominium, townhouse, split-level, mobile home, multi-family" in the 20th century), and parts thereof "(driveway, breezeway, backyard, dooryard; clapboard, siding, trim, baseboard; stoop" (from Dutch), "family room, den;" and, in recent years, "HVAC, central air, walkout basement)."
Ever since the American Revolution, a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are "run (i.e, for office), gubernatorial, primary election, carpetbagger" (after the Civil War), "repeater", "lame duck" (a British term used originally in Banking) and "pork barrel."
Some of these are internationally used (for example, "caucus, gerrymander, filibuster, exit poll)."
19th century onwards.
The development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms.
Typical examples are the vocabulary of "railroading" (see further at rail terminology) and "transportation" terminology, ranging from names of roads (from "dirt roads" and "back roads" to "freeways" and "parkways)" to road infrastructure "(parking lot, overpass, rest area)," and from automotive terminology to "public transit" (for example, in the sentence ""riding" the "subway downtown""); such American introductions as "commuter" (from "commutation ticket), concourse, to board" (a vehicle), "to park, double-park" and "parallel park" (a car), "" or the noun "terminal" have long been used in all dialects of English.
Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations "(bartender, longshoreman, patrolman, hobo, bouncer, bellhop, roustabout, white collar, blue collar, employee, boss" [from Dutch], "intern, busboy, mortician, senior citizen)," businesses and workplaces "(department store, supermarket, thrift store, gift shop, drugstore, motel, main street, gas station, hardware store, savings and loan, hock" [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations "(automated teller machine, smart card, cash register, dishwasher, reservation" [as at hotels], "pay envelope, movie, mileage, shortage, outage, blood bank)."
Already existing English words—such as "store, shop, dry goods, haberdashery, lumber"—underwent shifts in meaning; some—such as "mason, student, clerk", the verbs "can" (as in "canned goods"), "ship, fix, carry, enroll" (as in school), "run" (as in "run a business"), "release" and "haul"—were given new significations, while others (such as "tradesman)" have retained meanings that disappeared in England.
From the world of business and finance came "breakeven, merger, , downsize, disintermediation, bottom line;" from sports terminology came, jargon aside, "Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan" (football); "in the ballpark, out of left field, off base, hit and run," and many other idioms from baseball; gamblers coined "bluff, , ante, bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown;" miners coined "bedrock, bonanza, peter out, pan out" and the verb "prospect" from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with "make the grade, sidetrack, head-on," and the verb "railroad."
A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: "elevator, ground, gasoline;" many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not "(hatchback, sport utility vehicle, station wagon, tailgate, motorhome, truck, pickup truck, to exhaust)."
In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from Yiddish "(chutzpah, schmooze, tush") and German—"hamburger" and culinary terms like "frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, wiener, deli(catessen); scram, kindergarten, gesundheit;" musical terminology "(whole note, half note," etc.); and apparently "cookbook, fresh" ("impudent") and "what gives?"
Such constructions as "Are you coming with?" and "I like to dance" (for "I like dancing") may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.
Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from "OK" and "cool" to "nerd" and "24/7)," while others have not "(have a nice day, for sure);" many are now distinctly old-fashioned "(swell, groovy)."
Some English words now in general use, such as "hijacking, disc jockey, boost, bulldoze" and "jazz," originated as American slang.
Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are "get the hang of, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, stiff upper lip, bad hair day, throw a monkey wrench, under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over, what goes around comes around," and "will the real x please stand up?" Morphology.
American English has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs.
Examples of verbed nouns are "interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service" (as a car), "corner, torch, exit" (as in "exit the lobby"), "factor" (in mathematics), "gun" ("shoot"), "author" (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, "proposition, graft" (bribery), "bad-mouth, vacation, major, backpack, backtrack, intern, ticket" (traffic violations), "hassle, blacktop, peer-review, dope" and "OD", and, of course "verbed" as used at the start of this sentence.
Compounds coined in the U.S. are for instance "foothill, flatlands, badlands, landslide" (in all senses), "overview" (the noun), ", teenager, brainstorm, , hitchhike, smalltime, , frontman, lowbrow" and "highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face" (later verbed), "upfront" (in all senses), "fixer-upper, no-show;" many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: "non-profit, for-profit, free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;" many compound nouns and adjectives are open: "happy hour, fall guy, capital gain, road trip, wheat pit, head start, plea bargain;" some of these are colorful "(empty nester, loan shark, , buzz saw, ghetto blaster, dust bunny)," others are euphemistic "(differently abled (physically challenged), human resources, affirmative action, correctional facility)."
Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: ", stopover, lineup, , tryout, spin-off, rundown" ("summary"), "shootout, holdup, hideout, comeback, cookout, kickback, makeover, takeover, rollback" ("decrease"), "rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up" ("stoppage"), "stand-in."
These essentially are nouned phrasal verbs; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin "(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in" and "check out" (in all senses), "fill in" ("inform"), "kick in" or "throw in" ("contribute"), "square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off" (from employment), "run into" and "across" ("meet"), "stop by, pass up, put up" (money), "set up" ("frame"), "trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out)."
Noun endings such as "-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)" and "-cian (beautician)" are also particularly productive.
Some verbs ending in "-ize" are of U.S. origin; for example, "fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, weatherize, winterize, Mirandize;" and so are some back-formations "(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve" and "enthuse)."
Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are "as of" (with dates and times), "outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to" and "lack for."
Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably "pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry" (as in "pry open", from "prize), putter" (verb), "buddy, sundae, skeeter, sashay" and "kitty-corner."
Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, "lengthy, bossy, cute" and "cutesy, grounded" (of a child), "punk" (in all senses), "sticky" (of the weather), "through" (as in "through train", or meaning "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as "peppy" or "wacky".
American blends include "motel, guesstimate, infomercial" and "televangelist."
English words that survived in the United States and not in the United Kingdom.
A number of words and meanings that originated in Middle English or Early Modern English and that have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in Lowland Scots.
Terms such as "fall" ("autumn"), "faucet" ("tap"), "diaper" ("nappy"), "candy" ("sweets"), "skillet", "eyeglasses" and "obligate" are often regarded as Americanisms.
"Fall" for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year".
During the 17th century, English immigration to the British colonies in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them.
While the term "fall" gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America.
"Gotten" (past participle of "get") is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of Britain, such as Lancashire and North East England, that still continue to use it and sometimes also use "putten" as the past participle for "put" (which is not done by most speakers of American English).
Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include "hire" ("to employ"), "quit" ("to stop", which spawned "quitter" in the U.S.), "I guess" (famously criticized by  <START:person> H. W. Fowler <END> ), "baggage", "hit" (a place), and the adverbs "overly" and "presently" ("currently").
Some of these, for example "monkey wrench" and "wastebasket", originated in 19th century Britain.
The mandative subjunctive (as in "the City Attorney suggested that the case "not be closed"") is livelier in American English than it is in British English.
It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal.
The adjectives "mad" meaning "angry", "smart" meaning "intelligent", and "sick" meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English.
Regionally distinct English words within the United States.
Linguist  <START:person> Bert Vaux <END>  created a survey polling English speakers across the United States about the specific words they use for a variety of given definitions.
This 2003 study concludes that: Regional differences.
While written American English is (in general) standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary.
"General American" is the name given to any American accent that is often considered relatively free of noticeable regional influences.
Eastern seaboard.
After the Civil War, the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, (koineization) so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the Eastern seaboard.
The Connecticut River and Long Island Sound is usually regarded as the southern/western extent of New England speech, which has its roots in the speech of the Puritans from East Anglia who settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
The Potomac River generally divides a group of Northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the Coastal Southern dialect area; in between these two rivers several local variations exist, chief among them the one that prevails in and around New York City and northern New Jersey, which developed on a Dutch substratum after the English conquered New Amsterdam.
The main features of Coastal Southern speech can be traced to the speech of the English from the West Country who settled in Virginia after leaving England at the time of the English Civil War.
Midwest.
A distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between Canada and the United States, centered on the Great Lakes region (but only on the American side).
This is the Inland North Dialect—the "standard Midwestern" speech that was the basis for General American in the mid-20th century (although it has been recently modified by the northern cities vowel shift).
Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both collectively as "Midwestern" in the Mid-Atlantic region or "Northern" in the Southern US.
The so-called '"Minnesotan" dialect is also prevalent in the cultural Upper Midwest, and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (like "yah" for yes, pronounced similarly to "ja" in German, Norwegian and Swedish).
In parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio, another dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch English is also spoken.
Interior.
In the interior, the situation is very different.
West of the Appalachian Mountains begins the broad zone of what is generally called "Midland" speech.
This is divided into two discrete subdivisions, the North Midland that begins north of the Ohio River valley area, and the South Midland speech; sometimes the former is designated simply "Midland" and the latter is reckoned as "Highland Southern".
The North Midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related Western dialect which contains Pacific Northwest English as well as California English, although in the immediate San Francisco area some older speakers do not possess the cot–caught merger and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which reflects a historical Mid-Atlantic heritage.
The South Midland or Highland Southern dialect follows the Ohio River in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across Arkansas and Oklahoma west of the Mississippi, and peters out in West Texas.
It is a version of the Midland speech that has assimilated some coastal Southern forms (outsiders often mistakenly believe South Midland speech and coastal South speech to be the same).
Although no longer region-specific, African American Vernacular English, which remains prevalent among African Americans, has a close relationship to Southern varieties of American English and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans.
The island state of Hawaii has a distinctive Hawaiian Pidgin.
Finally, dialect development in the United States has been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Charleston, Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which imposed their marks on the surrounding areas.
Differences between British and American English.
American English and British English (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, "An American Dictionary of the English Language", was written by  <START:person> Noah Webster <END>  in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.
Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and normally do not affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some verbal auxiliaries; formal (rather than notional) agreement with collective nouns; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: "learned"/"learnt", "burned"/"burnt", "snuck/sneaked", "dove/dived") although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE "in school," BrE "at school"); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE "to the hospital", BrE "to hospital"; contrast, however, AmE "actress  <START:person> Elizabeth Taylor <END> ", BrE "the actress  <START:person> Elizabeth Taylor <END> ").
Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other, and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.
Differences in orthography are also minor.
The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as "flavor" for British "flavour", "fiber" for "fibre", "defense" for "defence", "analyze" for "analyse", "catalog" for "catalogue" and "traveling" for "travelling".
 <START:person> Noah Webster <END>  popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them.
Rather, "he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology".
Other differences are due to the francophile tastes of 19th century Victorian England (for example they preferred "programme" for "program", "manoeuvre" for "maneuver", "cheque" for "check", etc.).
AmE almost always uses "-ize" in words like "realize".
BrE prefers "-ise", but also uses "-ize" (see Oxford spelling).
There are a few differences in punctuation rules.
British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called "comma splices" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside.
American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.
AmE sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE "transportation" and BrE "transport" or where the British form is a back-formation, such as AmE "burglarize" and BrE "burgle" (from "burglar").
However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.
Apollo 14  Apollo 14 was the eighth manned mission in the United States Apollo program, and the third to land on the Moon.
It was the last of the "H missions," targeted landings with two-day stays on the Moon with two lunar EVAs, or moonwalks.
Commander  <START:person> Alan Shepard <END> , Command Module Pilot  <START:person> Stuart Roosa <END> , and Lunar Module Pilot  <START:person> Edgar Mitchell <END>  launched on their nine-day mission on January 31, 1971 at 4:04:02 pm local time after a 40-minute, 2 second delay due to launch site weather restrictions, the first such delay in the Apollo program.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  made their lunar landing on February 5 in the Fra Mauro formation; this had originally been the target of the aborted Apollo 13 mission.
During the two lunar EVAs, 42 kg of Moon rocks were collected and several surface experiments, including seismic studies, were performed.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  famously hit two golf balls on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought from Earth.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  spent about 33 hours on the Moon, with about 9½ hours on EVA.
In the aftermath of Apollo 13, several modifications were made to the service module to prevent a repeat of that accident, including improved wiring insulation and a third oxygen tank.
While  <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  were on the surface,  <START:person> Roosa <END>  remained in lunar orbit aboard the Command/Service Module "Kitty Hawk", performing scientific experiments and photographing the Moon, including the landing site of the future Apollo 16 mission.
He took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were germinated on return, resulting in the so-called Moon trees.
 <START:person> Shepard <END> ,  <START:person> Roosa <END> , and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  landed in the Pacific Ocean on February 9. Crew.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  was the oldest U.S. astronaut when he made his trip aboard Apollo 14.
He is the only astronaut from Project Mercury (the original Mercury Seven astronauts) to reach the Moon.
Another of the original seven,  <START:person> Gordon Cooper <END> , had (as Apollo 10's backup commander) tentatively been scheduled to command the mission, but according to author  <START:person> Andrew Chaikin <END> , his casual attitude toward training, along with problems with NASA hierarchy (reaching all the way back to the Mercury-Atlas 9 flight), resulted in his removal.
The mission was a personal triumph for  <START:person> Shepard <END> , who had battled back from  <START:person> Ménière <END> 's disease which grounded him from 1964 to 1968.
He and his crew were originally scheduled to fly on Apollo 13, but in 1969 NASA officials switched the scheduled crews for Apollos 13 and 14.
This was done to allow  <START:person> Shepard <END>  more time to train for his flight, as he had been grounded for four years.
As of 2015,  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  is the only surviving member of the crew;  <START:person> Roosa <END>  died in 1994 from pancreatitis and  <START:person> Shepard <END>  in 1998 from leukemia.
Mission highlights.
Launch and flight to lunar orbit.
Apollo 14 launched during heavy cloud cover and the Saturn V booster quickly disappeared from view.
However, NASA's long-range cameras, based 60 miles south in Vero Beach, had a clear shot of the remainder of the launch.
Following the launch, the Launch Control Center at Kennedy Space Center was visited by U.S. Vice President  <START:person> Spiro T. Agnew <END> , Prince  <START:person> Juan Carlos <END>  of Spain, and his wife, Princess  <START:person> Sofía <END> .
At the beginning of the mission, the CSM "Kitty Hawk" had difficulty achieving capture and docking with the LM "Antares".
Repeated attempts to dock went on for 1 hour and 42 minutes, until it was suggested that  <START:person> Roosa <END>  hold "Kitty Hawk" against "Antares" using its thrusters, then the docking probe would be retracted out of the way, hopefully triggering the docking latches.
This attempt was successful, and no further docking problems were encountered during the mission.
Lunar descent.
After separating from the Command Module in lunar orbit, the LM "Antares" also had two serious problems.
First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from a faulty switch.
NASA believed that the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of solder had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit.
The immediate solution—tapping on the panel next to the switch—did work briefly, but the circuit soon closed again.
If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the ascent stage to separate from the descent stage and climb back into orbit.
NASA and the software teams at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scrambled to find a solution, and determined the fix would involve reprogramming the flight software to ignore the false signal.
The software modifications were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time.
A second problem occurred during the powered descent, when the LM landing radar failed to lock automatically onto the  <START:person> Moon <END> 's surface, depriving the navigation computer of vital information on the vehicle's altitude and vertical descent speed (this was not a result of the modifications to the ABORT command; rather, the post-mission report indicated it was an unrelated bug in the radar's operation).
After the astronauts cycled the landing radar breaker, the unit successfully acquired a signal near 18000 ft, again just in the nick of time.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  then manually landed the LM closer to its intended target than any of the other six Moon landing missions.
 <START:person> Mitchell <END>  believes that  <START:person> Shepard <END>  would have continued with the landing attempt without the radar, using the LM inertial guidance system and visual cues.
But a post-flight review of the descent data showed the inertial system alone would have been inadequate, and the astronauts probably would have been forced to abort the landing as they approached the surface.
Lunar surface operations.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  named their landing site "Fra Mauro Base", and this designation is recognized by the International Astronomical Union (depicted in Latin on lunar maps as "Statio Fra Mauro").
 <START:person> Shepard <END> 's first words, after stepping onto the lunar surface were, "And it's been a long way, but we're here."
Unlike  <START:person> Neil Armstrong <END>  on Apollo 11 and  <START:person> Pete Conrad <END>  on Apollo 12,  <START:person> Shepard <END>  had already stepped off the LM footpad and was a few yards (meters) away before he spoke.
 <START:person> Shepard <END> 's moonwalking suit was the first to utilize red stripes on the arms and legs and on the top of the lunar EVA sunshade "hood," so as to allow easy identification between the commander and LM pilot on the surface; on the Apollo 12 pictures, it had been almost impossible to distinguish between the two crewmen, causing a great deal of confusion.
This feature was included on  <START:person> Jim Lovell <END> 's Apollo 13 suit; however, because no landing was made on that mission, Apollo 14 was the first to make use of it.
This feature was used for the remaining Apollo missions, and for the EVAs of Space Shuttle flights afterwards, and it is still in use today on both the U.S. and Russian space suits on the International Space Station.
After landing in the Fra Mauro formation—the destination for Apollo 13— <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  took two moonwalks, adding new seismic studies to the by now familiar Apollo experiment package (ALSEP), and using the Modular Equipment Transporter (MET), a pull cart for carrying equipment and samples, referred to as a "lunar rickshaw."
 <START:person> Roosa <END> , meanwhile, took pictures from on board Command Module "Kitty Hawk" in lunar orbit.
The second moonwalk, or EVA, was intended to reach the rim of the 1000 ft wide Cone Crater.
However, the two astronauts were not able to find the rim amid the rolling terrain of the crater's slopes.
They became physically exhausted from the attempt and with their suits' oxygen supplies starting to run low, the effort was called off.
Later analysis, using the pictures that they took, determined that they had come within an estimated 65 ft of the crater's rim.
Images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) show the tracks of the astronauts and the MET come to within 30 m of the rim.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  and  <START:person> Mitchell <END>  deployed and activated various scientific instruments and experiments and collected almost 100 lb of lunar samples for return to Earth.
Other Apollo 14 achievements included: the only use of MET; longest distance traversed by foot on the lunar surface; first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; and the first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.
The astronauts also engaged in less serious activities on the Moon.
 <START:person> Shepard <END>  brought along a six iron golf club head which he could attach to the handle of a lunar excavation tool, and two golf balls, and took several one-handed swings (due to the limited flexibility of the EVA suit).
He exuberantly exclaimed that the second ball went "miles and miles and miles" in the low lunar gravity, but later estimated the distance as 200 to.
 <START:person> Mitchell <END>  then threw a lunar scoop handle as if it were a javelin.
Return, splashdown and quarantine.
On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space.
The Command Module "Kitty Hawk" splashed down in the South Pacific Ocean on February 9, 1971 at 21:05 [UTC], approximately 760 nmi south of American Samoa.
After recovery by the ship USS "New Orleans", the crew was flown to Pago Pago International Airport in Tafuna for a reception before being flown on a C-141 cargo plane to Honolulu.
The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be quarantined on their return from the Moon.
 <START:person> Roosa <END> , who worked in forestry in his youth, took several hundred tree seeds on the flight.
These were germinated after the return to Earth, and widely distributed around the world as commemorative Moon trees.
Mission insignia.
The oval insignia shows a gold NASA Astronaut Pin, given to U.S. astronauts upon completing their first space flight, traveling from the Earth to the Moon.
A gold band around the edge includes the mission and astronaut names.
The designer was  <START:person> Jean Beaulieu <END> .
The backup crew spoofed the patch with its own version, with revised artwork showing a  <START:person> Wile E. Coyote <END>  cartoon character depicted as gray-bearded (for  <START:person> Shepard <END> , who was 47 at the time of the mission and the oldest man on the Moon), pot-bellied (for  <START:person> Mitchell <END> , who had a pudgy appearance) and red furred (for  <START:person> Roosa <END> 's red hair), still on the way to the Moon, while Road Runner (for the backup crew) is already on the Moon, holding a U.S. flag and a flag labeled "1st Team."
The flight name is replaced by "BEEP BEEP" and the backup crew's names are given.
Several of these patches were hidden by the backup crew and found during the flight by the crew in notebooks and storage lockers in both the CSM "Kitty Hawk" and the LM "Antares" spacecraft, and one patch was even stored on the MET lunar hand cart.
Spacecraft location.
The Apollo 14 Command Module "Kitty Hawk" is on display at the Apollo/Saturn V Center building at the Kennedy Space Center after being on display at the Astronaut Hall of Fame near Titusville, Florida, for several years.
The ascent stage of Lunar Module "Antares" impacted the Moon on February 7, 1971 at 00:45:25.7 UT (February 6, 7:45 PM EST) .
"Antares"' descent stage and the mission's other equipment remain at Fra Mauro at .
Photographs taken in 2009 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter were released on July 17, and the Fra Mauro equipment was the most visible Apollo hardware at that time, owing to particularly good lighting conditions.
In 2011, the LRO returned to the landing site at a lower altitude to take higher resolution photographs.

NASA reports Multimedia  A. J. Ayer  Sir  <START:person> Alfred Jules <END>  "Freddie" Ayer (; 29 October 1910 – 27 June 1989) was a British philosopher known for his promotion of logical positivism, particularly in his books "Language, Truth, and Logic" (1936) and "The Problem of Knowledge" (1956).
He was educated at Eton College and Oxford University, after which he studied the philosophy of Logical Positivism at the University of Vienna.
From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at Christ Church College, Oxford.
During the Second World War Ayer was a Special Operations Executive and MI6 agent.
He was Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become Wykeham Professor of Logic.
He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1951 to 1952 and knighted in 1970.
Early life.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was born in St John's Wood, in north west London, to a wealthy family from continental Europe.
His mother,  <START:person> Reine Citroën <END> , was from the Dutch Jewish family who founded the Citroën car company in France.
His father,  <START:person> Jules Ayer <END> , was a Swiss Calvinist financier who worked for the  <START:person> Rothschild <END>  family.
Education.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was educated at Ascham St Vincent's School, a former boarding preparatory school for boys in the seaside town of Eastbourne in Sussex, in which he started boarding at the comparatively early age of seven, due to the First World War, and Eton College, a boarding school in Eton (near Windsor) in Berkshire.
It was at Eton that  <START:person> Ayer <END>  first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity.
Although primarily interested in furthering his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the Eton Wall Game very well.
In the final examinations at Eton,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  came second in his year, and first in classics.
In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of corporal punishment at the school.
He won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.
Life and career.
After graduation from Oxford University Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, "Language, Truth and Logic" in 1936.
The first exposition in English of Logical Positivism as newly developed by the Vienna Circle, this made Ayer at age 26 the 'enfant terrible' of British philosophy.
In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and MI6).
After the war he briefly returned to Oxford University where he became a fellow and Dean of Wadham College.
He thereafter taught philosophy at London University from 1946 until 1959, when he also started to appear on radio and television.
He was an extrovert, and social mixer, and was married four times, including to  <START:person> Dee Wells <END>  and  <START:person> Vanessa Salmon <END>  (thus becoming stepfather to  <START:person> Nigella Lawson <END> ).
Reputedly he liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York.
He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of the Tottenham Hotspur football team.
For an academic,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high society' and the establishment.
Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.
Philosophical ideas.
In Language, Truth and Logic (1936),  <START:person> Ayer <END>  asserts the verification principle as the only valid basis for philosophy.
Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like "God exists" or "charity is good" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored.
Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense.
He also criticises  <START:person> C. A. Mace <END> 's opinion that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry.
The stance of a person who believes "God" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as igtheism (for example, by  <START:person> Paul Kurtz <END> ).
In later years  <START:person> Ayer <END>  reiterated that he did not believe in God and began to refer to himself as an atheist.
He followed in the footsteps of  <START:person> Bertrand Russell <END>  by debating with the Jesuit scholar  <START:person> Frederick Copleston <END>  on the topic of religion.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's version of emotivism divides "the ordinary system of ethics" into four classes: He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in normative ethics as opposed to meta-ethics) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.
While class three statements were irrelevant to Ayer's brand of emotivism, they would later play a significant role in  <START:person> Stevenson <END> 's.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with ethical intuitionists.
But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition as "worthless" for determining moral truths, since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another.
Instead,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  concludes that ethical concepts are "mere pseudo-concepts": The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content.
Thus if I say to someone, "You acted wrongly in stealing that money," I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, "You stole that money."
In adding that this action is wrong I am not making any further statement about it.
I am simply evincing my moral disapproval of it.
It is as if I had said, "You stole that money," in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the addition of some special exclamation marks.
… If now I generalise my previous statement and say, "Stealing money is wrong," I produce a sentence that has no factual meaning—that is, expresses no proposition that can be either true or false.
… I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments.
Between 1945 and 1947, together with  <START:person> Russell <END>  and  <START:person> George Orwell <END> , he contributed a series of articles to "Polemic", a short-lived British "Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics" edited by the ex-Communist  <START:person> Humphrey Slater <END> .
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was closely associated with the British humanist movement.
He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1947 until his death.
He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963.
In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded  <START:person> Julian Huxley <END>  as president of the British Humanist Association, a post he held until 1970.
In 1968 he edited "The Humanist Outlook", a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism.
In addition he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.
He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at Bard College in the fall of 1987.
At a party that same year held by fashion designer  <START:person> Fernando Sanchez <END> ,  <START:person> Ayer <END> , then 77, confronted  <START:person> Mike Tyson <END>  who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model  <START:person> Naomi Campbell <END> .
When  <START:person> Ayer <END>  demanded that  <START:person> Tyson <END>  stop, the boxer said: "Do you know who the fuck I am?
I'm the heavyweight champion of the world," to which  <START:person> Ayer <END>  replied: "And I am the former Wykeham Professor of Logic.
We are both pre-eminent in our field.
I suggest that we talk about this like rational men".
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  and  <START:person> Tyson <END>  then began to talk, while  <START:person> Naomi Campbell <END>  slipped out.
Later career.
From 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir  <START:person> Alfred <END>  held the Wykham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford.
He was knighted in 1970.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  died on 27 June 1989.
From 1980 – 1989,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  lived at 51 York Street, Marylebone, where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.
Personal life.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was married four times to three women.
His first marriage was from 1932–1941 to (Grace Isabel)  <START:person> Renée <END>  (d.
1980), who subsequently married philosopher  <START:person> Stuart Hampshire <END> ,  <START:person> Ayer <END> 's friend and colleague.
In 1960 he married  <START:person> Alberta Constance <END>  (Dee) Wells (1925–2003), with whom he had one son.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's marriage to  <START:person> Wells <END>  was dissolved in 1983 and that same year he married  <START:person> Vanessa Salmon <END> , former wife of politician  <START:person> Nigel Lawson <END> .
She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried  <START:person> Dee Wells <END> , who survived him.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist  <START:person> Sheilah Graham Westbrook <END> .
Near-death experience.
In 1988, shortly before his death,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  wrote an article entitled, "What I saw when I was dead", describing an unusual near-death experience.
Of the experience,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  first said that it "slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be."
However, a few days later he revised this, saying "what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief".
In 2001 Dr  <START:person> Jeremy George <END> , the attending physician, claimed that  <START:person> Ayer <END>  had confided to him: "I saw a Divine Being.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions."
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's son  <START:person> Nick <END> , however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.
Works.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  is best known for popularising the verification principle, in particular through his presentation of it in "Language, Truth, and Logic" (1936).
The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called Vienna Circle which  <START:person> Ayer <END>  visited as a young guest.
Others, including the leading light of the circle,  <START:person> Moritz Schlick <END> , were already offering their own papers on the issue.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable empirical import, otherwise it is either "analytical" if tautologous, or "metaphysical" (i.e.
meaningless, or "literally senseless").
He started to work on the book at the age of 23 and it was published when he was 26.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and  <START:person> David Hume <END> .
His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes "Language, Truth and Logic" essential reading on the tenets of logical empiricism– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century analytic philosophy, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world.
In it,  <START:person> Ayer <END>  also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour', an argument which anticipates the Turing test published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  wrote two books on the philosopher  <START:person> Bertrand Russell <END> , " <START:person> Russell <END>  and  <START:person> Moore <END> : The Analytic Heritage" (1971) and "Russell" (1972).
He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of  <START:person> David Hume <END>  and a short biography of  <START:person> Voltaire <END> .
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  was strong critic of the German philosopher  <START:person> Martin Heidegger <END> .
As a logical positivist  <START:person> Ayer <END>  was in conflict with  <START:person> Heidegger <END> 's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence.
These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis.
This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought.
He considered  <START:person> Heidegger <END>  to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.
In 1972–1973  <START:person> Ayer <END>  gave the Gifford Lectures at University of St Andrews, later published as "The Central Questions of Philosophy".
In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord  <START:person> Gifford <END>  wished to promote '"Natural Theology", in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are "able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth".
He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called "philosophy"– including the whole of metaphysics, theology and aesthetics– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.
In "The Concept of a Person and Other Essays" (1963),  <START:person> Ayer <END>  heavily criticized  <START:person> Wittgenstein <END> 's private language argument.
 <START:person> Ayer <END> 's sense-data theory in "Foundations of Empirical Knowledge" was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian  <START:person> J. L. Austin <END>  in "Sense and Sensibilia", a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy.
 <START:person> Ayer <END>  responded to this in the essay "Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?", which can be found in his "Metaphysics and Common Sense" (1969).
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci  Amerigo Vespucci <END>  (]; March 9, 1454 – February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus' voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to Afro-Eurasians.
Colloquially referred to as the New World, this second super continent came to be termed "America", deriving its name from Americus, the Latin version of  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's first name.
Background.
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  was born and raised in Florence, Italy.
He was the third son of  <START:person> Ser Nastagio <END>  ( <START:person> Anastasio <END> ), a Florentine notary, and Lisabetta Mini.
 <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  was educated by his uncle,  <START:person> Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci <END> , a Dominican friar of the monastery of San Marco in Florence.
While his elder brothers were sent to the University of Pisa to pursue scholarly careers,  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial house of Medici, headed by  <START:person> Lorenzo <END>  de' Medici.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  acquired the favor and protection of  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici <END>  who became the head of the business after the elder  <START:person> Lorenzo <END> 's death in 1492.
In March 1492, the  <START:person> Medici <END>  dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  and  <START:person> Donato Niccolini <END>  as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in Cádiz (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.
In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop  <START:person> Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca <END> , the Crown of Castile broke their monopoly deal with  <START:person> Christopher Columbus <END>  and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the West Indies.
Just around this time (1495–96),  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was engaged as the executor of  <START:person> Giannotto Berardi <END> , an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  organized the fulfillment of  <START:person> Berardi <END> 's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.
After these were delivered,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.
Expeditions.
At the invitation of king  <START:person> Manuel <END>  I of Portugal,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of South America between 1499 and 1502.
On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.
The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  were published between 1502 and 1504.
In 1507,  <START:person> Martin Waldseemüller <END>  produced a world map on which he named the new continent America after the feminine Latin version of  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's first name, which is Americus.
In an accompanying book,  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was trying to upset  <START:person> Christopher Columbus <END> ' glory.
However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the Soderini Letter, could be fabrications, not by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , but by others.
Historical role.
In 1508 the position of chief of navigation of Spain ("piloto mayor de Indias") was created for  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.
Two letters attributed to  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  were published during his lifetime.
"Mundus Novus" (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from Lisbon to  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco <END>  de' Medici.
It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502.
"Mundus Novus" was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.
"Lettera di  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi" (Letter of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END>  concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as "Lettera al Soderini" or just "Lettera", was a letter in Italian addressed to  <START:person> Piero Soderini <END> .
Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  between 1497 and 1504.
A Latin translation was published by the German  <START:person> Martin Waldseemüller <END>  in 1507 in "Cosmographiae Introductio", a book on cosmography and geography, as "Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes" (Four Voyages of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END> ).
On March 22, 1508, King  <START:person> Ferdinand <END>  made  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).
In the 18th century three unpublished familiar letters from  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered.
One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the "four voyages".
Another was written from Cape Verde in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic.
The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.
Some have suggested that  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications.
However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> .
It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  to name the new continent America on his world map of 1507 in  <START:person> Lorraine <END> .
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  used a Latinised form of his name,  <START:person> Americus Vespucius <END> , in his Latin writings, which  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form "America", according to the prevalent view (for other hypotheses, see the footnote in the introduction).
The book accompanying the map stated: "I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women".
It is possible that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was not aware that  <START:person> Waldseemüller <END>  had named the continent after him.
The two disputed letters claim that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources.
At the moment there is a dispute between historians on when  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  visited the mainland the first time.
Some historians like  <START:person> Germán Arciniegas <END>  and  <START:person> Gabriel Camargo Pérez <END>  think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries.
From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication.
Voyages.
The first and fourth voyages are disputed to have occurred, while the second and third are certain voyages.
First voyage.
A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , written to  <START:person> Soderini <END> , of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498.
However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.
Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of hammocks and sweat lodges.
The names of  <START:person> Amerigo Vespucci <END> 's ships were the San Antiago, Repertaga, Wegiz, and the Girmand.
Second voyage.
About 1499–1500,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with  <START:person> Alonso de Ojeda <END>  (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander.
The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the Indian Ocean.
After hitting land at the coast of what is now Guyana, the two seem to have separated.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the Amazon River and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing Trinidad and the Orinoco River and returning to Spain by way of  <START:person> Hispaniola <END> .
The letter, to  <START:person> Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici <END> , claims that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  determined his longitude celestially on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage.
However, that claim may be fraudulent, which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.
Third voyage.
The last certain voyage of  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was led by  <START:person> Gonçalo Coelho <END>  in 1501–1502 in the service of Portugal.
Departing from Lisbon, the fleet sailed first to Cape Verde where they met two of  <START:person> Pedro Álvares Cabral <END> 's ships returning from India.
In a letter from Cape Verde,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  says that he hopes to visit the same lands that  <START:person> Álvares Cabral <END>  had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage.
On reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed south along the coast of South America to Rio de Janeiro's bay.
If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of Patagonia before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the Río de la Plata, which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south.
Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of  <START:person> Coelho <END>  and  <START:person> Vespucci <END> , do not show any land south of present-day Cananéia at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.
After the first half of the expedition,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  mapped Alpha and Beta Centauri, as well as the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross.
Although these stars had been known to the ancient Greeks, gradual precession had lowered them below the European horizon so that they had been forgotten.
On his return to Lisbon,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  or  <START:person> Marco Polo <END>  and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.
Fourth voyage.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504.
Like his alleged first voyage,  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place.
The only source of information for the last voyage is the "Letter to Soderini", but as several modern scholars dispute  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  undertook this trip.[b]
However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain  <START:person> Gonçalo Coelho <END> , very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition ( <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  went on board this one as well.
However, it is not independently confirmed  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.
The letters caused controversy after  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed  <START:person> Columbus <END> ' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged  <START:person> Vespucci <END> 's reputation.
Personal.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  was a cousin of the husband of  <START:person> Simonetta Vespucci <END> .
He married  <START:person> Maria Cerezo <END> .
One of the very few references to  <START:person> Amerigo <END> 's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512 giving his widow,  <START:person> Maria Cerezo <END>  a lifetime pension of ten thousand marvedis per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.
Final years.
Not long after his return to Spain,  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  became a Spanish citizen.
On March 22, 1508 he was made the pilot major of Spain by  <START:person> Ferdinand II of Aragon <END>  in honor of his discoveries.
 <START:person> Vespucci <END>  also ran a school for navigators.
He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in Seville, Spain and was buried at  <START:person> Vespucci <END>  family burial place in Florence, Italy.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt  Johann Adam Weishaupt <END>  (6 February 1748 – 18 November 1830) was a German philosopher and founder of the Order of the Illuminati, a secret society.
Early life.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  was born on 6 February 1748 in Ingolstadt in the Electorate of Bavaria.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's father  <START:person> Johann Georg Weishaupt <END>  (1717–1753) died when  <START:person> Adam <END>  was five years old.
After his father's death he came under the tutelage of his godfather  <START:person> Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt <END>  who, like his father, was a professor of law at the University of Ingolstadt.
 <START:person> Ickstatt <END>  was a proponent of the philosophy of Christian  <START:person> Wolff <END>  and of the Enlightenment, and he influenced the young  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  with his rationalism.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  began his formal education at age seven at a Jesuit school.
He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768 at age 20 with a doctorate of law.
In 1772 he became a professor of law.
The following year he married  <START:person> Afra Sausenhofer <END>  of  <START:person> Eichstätt <END> .
After  <START:person> Pope Clement XIV <END> ’s suppression of the Society of  <START:person> Jesus <END>  in 1773,  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  became a professor of canon law, a position that was held exclusively by the Jesuits until that time.
In 1775  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was introduced to the empirical philosophy of  <START:person> Johann Georg Heinrich Feder <END>  of the University of Göttingen.
Both  <START:person> Feder <END>  and  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  would later become opponents of Kantian idealism.
Founder of the Illuminati.
At a time, however, when there was no end of making game of and abusing secret societies, I planned to make use of this human foible for a real and worthy goal, for the benefit of people.
I wished to do what the heads of the ecclesiastical and secular authorities ought to have done by virtue of their offices ... On May day 1776  <START:person> Johann Adam Weishaupt <END>  founded the "Illuminati" in the Electorate of Bavaria.
He adopted the name of "Brother Spartacus" within the order.
Even Encyclopedia references vary on the goal of the order, such as New Advent saying the Order was not egalitarian or democratic internally, and sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society; while others like  <START:person> Collier <END> 's have said the aim was to combat religion and foster rationalism in its place.
The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies.
Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know: a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was initiated into the Masonic Lodge "Theodor zum guten Rath", at Munich in 1777.
His project of "illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice" was an unwelcome reform.
He used Freemasonry to recruit for his own quasi-masonic society, with the goal of "perfecting human nature" through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion.
Presenting their own system as pure masonry,  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  and  <START:person> Adolph Freiherr Knigge <END> , who organised his ritual structure, greatly expanded the secret organisation.
Contrary to  <START:person> Immanuel Kant <END> 's famous dictum that Enlightenment (and  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order was in some respects an expression of the Enlightenment Movement) was the passage by man out of his 'self-imposed immaturity' through daring to 'make use of his own reason, without the guidance of another,'  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order of Illuminati prescribed in great detail everything which the members had obediently to read and think, so that Dr.  <START:person> Wolfgang Riedel <END>  has commented that this approach to illumination or enlightenment constituted a degradation and twisting of the Kantian principle of Enlightenment.
 <START:person> Riedel <END>  writes: 'The independence of thought and judgement required by Kant ... was specifically prevented by the Order of the Illuminati's rules and regulations.
Enlightenment takes place here, if it takes place at all, precisely "under" the direction of another, namely under that of the "Superiors" [of the Order].
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's radical rationalism and vocabulary was not likely to succeed.
Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of  <START:person> Karl Theodor <END> , Elector of Bavaria, in 1784.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria.
Activities in exile.
He received the assistance of  <START:person> Duke Ernest II <END>  of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1745–1804), and lived in Gotha writing a series of works on illuminism, including "A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria" (1785), "A Picture of Illuminism" (1786), "An Apology for the Illuminati" (1786), and "An Improved System of Illuminism" (1787).
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  died in Gotha on 18 November 1830.
He was survived by his second wife,  <START:person> Anna Maria <END>  (née Sausenhofer), and his children  <START:person> Nanette <END> , Charlotte, Ernst,  <START:person> Karl <END> ,  <START:person> Eduard <END> , and  <START:person> Alfred <END> .
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was buried next to his son  <START:person> Wilhelm <END>  who preceded him in death in 1802.
After  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's Order of Illuminati was banned and its members dispersed, it left behind no enduring traces of an influence, not even on its own erstwhile members, who went on in the future to develop in quite different directions.
Assessment of character and intentions.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's character and intentions have been variously assessed: from those such as the Abbé Barruel and  <START:person> John Robison <END>  who regarded him as a 'human devil' and saw his mission as one of malevolent destructiveness, to those who view him as a humane and benign, albeit wilful, social reformer.
Writing on this topic, Dr.  <START:person> Tony Page <END>  comments: "Weishaupt’s plan was to educate Illuminati followers in the highest levels of humanity and morality (basing his teachings on the supremacy of Reason, allied with the spirit of the Golden Rule of not doing to others what one would not wish done to oneself), so that if  <START:person> Illuminati <END>  alumni subsequently attained positions of significance and power (such as in the fields of education and politics), they could exert a benevolent and uplifting influence upon society at large.
His project was utopian and naively optimistic, and he himself was certainly not without flaws of character – but neither he nor his plan was evil or violent in and of themselves.
It is one of the deplorable and tragic ironies of history that a man who tried to inculcate virtue, philanthropy, social justice and morality has become one of the great hate-figures of 21st-century ‘conspiracy’ thinking."
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  in pop culture.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is referred to repeatedly in "The Illuminatus!
Trilogy", written by  <START:person> Robert Shea <END>  and  <START:person> Robert Anton Wilson <END> , as the founder of the Illuminati and as an imposter who killed  <START:person> George Washington <END>  and took his place as the first president of the United States.
Washington's portrait on the U.S. one-dollar bill is said to actually be  <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's.
Another version of  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  appears in the extensive comic book novel "Cerebus the Aardvark" by  <START:person> Dave Sim <END> , as a combination of  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  and  <START:person> George Washington <END> .
He appears primarily in the "Cerebus" and "Church & State I" volumes.
His motives are republican confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.
 <START:person> Weishaupt <END> 's name is one of many references made to the Illuminati and other conspiracies in the video game "Deus Ex" (2000).
The protagonist uncovers a virus engineered by the VersaLife Corporation with its molecular structure in multiples of 17 and 23.
An ally of the protagonist notes "1723.
The birth of  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END> " even though this reference is actually incorrect as  <START:person> Weishaupt <END>  was born in 1748.
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is also mentioned (" <START:person> Bush <END>  got a ouija to talk to  <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END> ") by the New York rapper  <START:person> Cage <END>  in El-P's "Accidents Don't Happen", the ninth track on his album "Fantastic Damage" (2002).
 <START:person> Adam Weishaupt <END>  is briefly mentioned in  <START:person> Umberto Eco <END> 's novel "The Prague Cemetery".
 <START:person> Asterix  Asterix <END>  or The Adventures of  <START:person> Asterix <END>  (French: Astérix or Astérix le Gaulois, ]) is a series of French comics.
The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine "Pilote" on 29 October 1959.
It was written by  <START:person> René Goscinny <END>  and illustrated by  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  until the death of  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  in 1977.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette.
As of 2013, 35 volumes have been released.
The series follows the exploits of a village of indomitable Gauls as they resist Roman occupation.
They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid called Getafix in the English translations, which gives the recipient superhuman strength.
The protagonist, the titular character  <START:person> Asterix <END> , along with his friend  <START:person> Obelix <END>  have various adventures.
The "ix" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish "ix" names in the series) "alludes" to the "rix" suffix (meaning "king") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as Vercingetorix, Orgetorix, and Dumnorix.
(See below for further explanations of the character names.)
Many of the stories have them travel to foreign countries, though others are set in and around their village.
For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.
The  <START:person> Asterix <END>  series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most European countries.
The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into 12 films: eight animated, and four live action.
There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris,  <START:person> Parc Astérix <END> .
To date, 325 million copies of 34 Asterix books have been sold worldwide, making co-creators  <START:person> René Goscinny <END>  and  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  France's bestselling authors abroad.
History.
Prior to creating the  <START:person> Asterix <END>  series,  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  and  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  had previously had success with their series "Oumpah-pah", which was published in "Tintin" magazine.
"Astérix" was originally serialised in "Pilote" magazine, in the very first issue published on 29 October 1959.
In 1961 the first book was put together, titled "Asterix the Gaul".
From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis.
Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000.
In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000.
A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and the Big Fight" sold 400,000 upon initial publication.
The ninth Asterix volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END> 's first sketches portrayed  <START:person> Asterix <END>  as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior.
But  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  had a different picture in his mind.
He visualized  <START:person> Asterix <END>  as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength.
However,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  agreed.
Hence,  <START:person> Obelix <END>  was born.
Despite the growing popularity of  <START:person> Asterix <END>  with the readers, the financial backing for Pilote ceased.
 <START:person> Pilote <END>  was taken over by  <START:person> Georges Dargaud <END> .
When  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  died in 1977,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue.
He continued the series but on a less frequent basis.
Most critics and fans of the series prefer  <START:person> Goscinny <END> 's albums.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  created his own publishing company, Les Editions Albert-René, which published every album drawn and written by  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  alone since then.
However,  <START:person> Dargaud <END> , the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  and  <START:person> Goscinny <END> .
In 1990, the  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  and  <START:person> Goscinny <END>  families decided to sue  <START:person> Dargaud <END>  to take over the rights.
In 1998, after a long trial,  <START:person> Dargaud <END>  lost the rights to publish and sell the albums.
 <START:person> Uderzo <END>  decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  (40%),  <START:person> Sylvie Uderzo <END>  (20%) and  <START:person> Anne Goscinny <END>  (40%).
Although  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  declared he did not want anyone to continue the series after his death, which is similar to the request  <START:person> Hergé <END>  made regarding his "The Adventures of Tintin", his attitude changed and in December 2008 he sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company and now owns the rights.
In a letter published in the French newspaper "Le Monde" in 2009,  <START:person> Uderzo <END> 's daughter,  <START:person> Sylvie <END> , attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new "Astérix" adventures after his death.
She said "...the co-creator of "Astérix", France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance”.
However,  <START:person> René Goscinny <END> 's daughter  <START:person> Anne <END>  also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time.
She is reported to have said that " <START:person> Asterix <END>  has already had two lives: one during my father's lifetime and one after it.
Why not a third?".
A few months later,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  appointed three illustrators, who had been his assistants for many years, to continue the series.
In 2011,  <START:person> Uderzo <END>  announced that a new  <START:person> Asterix <END>  album was due out in 2013, with  <START:person> Jean-Yves Ferri <END>  writing the story and  <START:person> Frédéric Mébarki <END>  drawing it.
A year later, in 2012, the publisher  <START:person> Albert-René <END>  announced that  <START:person> Frédéric Mébarki <END>  had withdrawn from drawing the new album, due to the pressure he felt in following in the steps of Uderzo.
Comic artist  <START:person> Didier Conrad <END>  was officially announced to take over drawing duties from Mébarki, with the due date of the new album in 2013 unchanged.
In January 2015, after the murders of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly  <START:person> Charlie Hebdo <END> , presumably for their controversial work, Astérix creator  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  came out of retirement to draw 2 Astérix pictures honoring the memories of the victims.

It was released in 1976, and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be canonical to the series.
The only English translation ever to be published were in the "Asterix Annual 1980" and as a standalone volume in 1984.
In 2007, Les Editions  <START:person> Albert René <END>  released a tribute volume titled "Astérix et ses Amis", a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories.
It was a tribute to  <START:person> Albert Uderzo <END>  on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists.
The volume was translated into nine languages.
s of 2010[ [update]], it has not been translated into English.
Synopsis and characters.
The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village in Armorica (present-day Brittany), a province of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (modern France), in the year 50 BC.
 <START:person> Julius Caesar <END>  has conquered nearly all of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  for the Roman Republic.
The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, Getafix.
His chief is  <START:person> Vitalstatistix <END> .
The main protagonist and hero of the village is  <START:person> Asterix <END> , who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village.
He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and unintelligent friend,  <START:person> Obelix <END> , who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength.
 <START:person> Obelix <END>  is usually accompanied by  <START:person> Dogmatix <END> , his little dog.
(Except for  <START:person> Asterix <END>  and  <START:person> Obelix <END> , the names of the characters change with the language.
For example,  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's dog's name is "Dogmatix" in English, but "Idéfix" in the original French edition.)
 <START:person> Asterix <END>  and  <START:person> Obelix <END>  (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands.
Places visited in the series include parts of  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (Lutetia, Corsica etc.), neighbouring nations (Belgium, Spain, Britain, Germany etc.), and far away lands (North America, Middle East, India etc.).
The series employs science-fiction and fantasy elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of extraterrestrials in " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and the Falling Sky" and the city of Atlantis in " <START:person> Asterix <END>  and Obelix All at Sea".
Humour.
The humour encountered in the "Asterix" comics is often centering on puns, caricatures, and tongue-in-cheek stereotypes of contemporary European nations and French regions.
Much of the humour in the initial  <START:person> Asterix <END>  books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story.
Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's famous "Ils sont fous ces romains" ("These Romans are crazy") is translated as " <START:person> Sono <END>  pazzi questi romani", alluding to the Roman abbreviation "SPQR".
In another example: Hiccups are written onomatopoeically in French as "hips," but in English as "hic," allowing Roman legionaries in at least one of the English translations to decline their hiccups in Latin ("hic, haec, hoc").
The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.
In spite of (or perhaps because of) this stereotyping, and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French chauvinism, the humour has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world.
Character names.
All the fictional characters in Asterix have names which are puns on their roles or personalities and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality.
Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an '-ix' suffix for the males and ending in '-a' for the females, for example, Chief Vitalstatistix (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife Impedimenta (often at odds with the chief).
The male Roman names end in '-us', echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in Gluteus Maximus, a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the butt of the joke.
Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in "-ic", after Gothic chiefs such as  <START:person> Alaric <END>  and Theoderic, for example Rhetoric the interpreter.
Greek names end in "-os" or "-es"; for example, Thermos the restaurateur.
British names end in "-ax" and are often puns on the taxation associated with the later United Kingdom, such as Valuaddedtax the druid and Selectivemploymentax the mercenary.
Other nationalities are treated to Pidgin translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning eggs and bacon, is often guidebook Spanish for tourists) or literary and other popular media references, like  <START:person> Dubbelosix <END>  (a reference to  <START:person> James Bond <END> 's codename 007).
Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation, for example, the druid Getafix is "Panoramix" in the original French and "Miraculix" in German.
Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved:  <START:person> Obelix <END> 's dog, known in the original French as "Idéfix" (from "idée fixe", a "fixed idea" or obsession), is called "Dogmatix" in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely ("dogmatic") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable "Dog-" at the beginning of the name.
The name " <START:person> Asterix <END> ", French "Astérix", comes from "astérisque", meaning "asterisk", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ ("aster"), meaning a "star").
His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local alphabets.
For example, in Esperanto, Polish, Slovene, Latvian, and Turkish it is "Asteriks".
In Turkish he was first named "Bücür" meaning "shorty", but the name was then changed.
An exception is in Icelandic, in which he is known as "Ástríkur" ("Rich of love").
In Sinhalese, the name is සිංහල ("Soora Pappa"), which can be interpreted as "Hero".
For explanations of some of the other names, see List of Asterix characters.
Translations.
The 35 volumes have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects.
Besides the original French language, most albums are available in Estonian, English, Czech, Dutch, German, Galician, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, modern Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Slovene, Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, Latvian,  <START:person> Welsh <END>  as well as Latin.
Some albums have also been translated into languages such as Esperanto, Scottish Gaelic, Indonesian, Persian, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Frisian, Romansch, Vietnamese, Sinhalese and Ancient Greek.
In France, Finland, and especially in Germany, several volumes were translated into a variety of regional languages and dialects, such as Alsatian, Breton,  <START:person> Chtimi <END>  ( <START:person> Picard <END> ) and Corsican in France, Bavarian, Swabian and Low German in Germany, and  <START:person> Savo <END> , Karelia, Rauma and Helsinki slang dialects in Finland.
Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume,  <START:person> Asterix <END>  the Gaul, was translated into local language Mirandese.
In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the Cretan Greek, Cypriot Greek and Pontic Greek dialects.
In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the Romanesque dialect.
In former Yugoslavia, "Forum" publishing house translated Corsican in "Asterix in Corsica" into Montenegrin dialect of Serbo-Croatian (today called Montenegrin language).
In the Netherlands several volumes were translated into Frisian, a language related to English spoken in the province of Friesland.
Also in the Netherlands two volumes were translated into Limburgish, a regional language spoken not only in Dutch Limburg but also in Belgian Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Hungarian-language books have been issued in Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia.
Although not a fully autonomous dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in Hungary.
In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into Sinhala ("Singhalese") as  <START:person> Sura Pappa <END> , the only Sri Lankan translation of a foreign cartoon that managed to keep the spirit of the original series intact.
Most volumes have been translated into Latin and Ancient Greek with accompanying teachers' guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages.
English translation.
The translation of the books into English has been done by  <START:person> Derek Hockridge <END>  and  <START:person> Anthea Bell <END> , and their English language rendition has been widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French version.
Adaptations.
The series has been adapted into various media.
Films.
Various motion pictures based upon the series have been made.
Games.
Many gamebooks, board games and video games are based upon the  <START:person> Asterix <END>  series.
In particular, many video games were released by various computer game publishers.
Theme park.
 <START:person> Parc Astérix <END> , a theme park 22 miles north of Paris, based upon the series, was opened in 1989.
It is one of the most visited sites in France, with around 1.6 million visitors per year.

</dl>  Algebraic extension  In abstract algebra, a field extension "L"/"K" is called algebraic if every element of "L" is algebraic over "K", i.e. if every element of "L" is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in "K".
Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain transcendental elements, are called transcendental.
For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q(√2)/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers.
All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree.
This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic.
The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic.
For instance, the field of all algebraic numbers is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.
If "a" is algebraic over "K", then "K"["a"], the set of all polynomials in "a" with coefficients in "K", is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of "K" which has finite degree over "K".
The converse is true as well, if "K"["a"] is a field, then "a" is algebraic over "K".
In the special case where "K" = Q is the field of rational numbers, Q["a"] is an example of an algebraic number field.
A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called algebraically closed.
An example is the field of complex numbers.
Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice.
An extension "L"/"K" is algebraic if and only if every sub "K"-algebra of "L" is a field.
Properties.
The class of algebraic extensions forms a distinguished class of field extensions, that is, the following three properties hold: These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction:  This fact, together with  <START:person> Zorn <END> 's lemma (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of algebraic closures.
Generalizations.
Model theory generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of "M" into "N" is called an algebraic extension if for every "x" in "N" there is a formula "p" with parameters in "M", such that "p"("x") is true and the set is finite.
It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension.
The  <START:person> Galois <END>  group of "N" over "M" can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of  <START:person> Galois <END>  groups can be developed for the general case.
Aster CT-80  The Aster CT-80, an early (1982) home/personal computer developed by the small Dutch company MCP (later renamed to Aster Computers), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists.
Later it was sold ready to use.
It consisted of several Eurocard PCB's with DIN 41612 connectors, and a backplane all based on a 19-inch rack configuration.
It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer.
The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy TRS-80 computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run CP/M software, with a big amount of free memory Transient Program Area, (TPA) and a full 80×25 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal.
Although the Aster was a clone of the TRS-80 Model I it was in fact more compatible with the TRS-80  <START:person> Model III <END> , and ran all the software of these systems including games.
It also had a built in speaker which was compatible with such games software.
Models.
Three models were sold.
The first model (launched June 1982) looked like the later IBM PC (which came on the market years later), a rectangular base unit with two floppy drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard.
The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5¼" floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened Apple with a built-in keyboard.
All units ran much faster than the original TRS-80, at 4 MHz, (with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic), and an improved character font set.
The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 KB, more than four times the capacity of the original TRS-80.
A special version of NewDos/80, (an improved TRS-DOS compatible Disk operating system) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.
For the educational market a version of the first model was produced with a new plastic enclosure (the First Asters had an all-metal enclosure) that also had an opening on the top in which a cassette recorder could be placed.
This model was used in a cluster with one Aster (with disk drives) for the teacher, and eight disk less versions for the pupils.
The pupils could download software from the teachers computer through a network based on a fast serial connection, as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer.
There was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor.
Working modes.
The Aster used 64KB of RAM memory and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy or with a TRS-DOS floppy, the Aster would be fully TRS-80 compatible, with 48KB or RAM.
When the boot loader detected a CP/M floppy, the Aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free RAM for programs (TPA) and an 80 x 25 display.
This dual-architecture capability only existed on one other TRS-80 clone, the LOBO Max-80.
With a special configuration tool, the CT-80 could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.
A third mode was entered with a special boot floppy which turned the Aster into a Videotex terminal with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in RS232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.
Sales.
Most Aster CT-80's (about 10 thousand of them) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the "honderd scholen project" (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools.
MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands.
Another important demand was that the computers could be used in a network (Aster developed special software and hardware for that).
Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to Philips and their P2000 homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the technical demands, was made in Austria and did not have network hard nor software.
The company.
Aster computers was based in the small town of Arkel near the town of Gorinchem.
Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music.
The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time .
They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the "junior Computer" from  <START:person> Elektor <END>  (a copy of the KIM-1), and the ZX80 from  <START:person> Sinclair <END> .
Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers.
But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the WD1771 floppy disc controller chip without an external "data separator".
To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation.
Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable.
So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure.
The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64 KB RAM chips.
While this went on MCP renamed itself to "MCP CHIP" but ran into problems with the German computer magazine CHIP, and had to return to its former name.
At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the TRS-80, the Video Genie, (another TRS-80 clone), the Luxor ABC 80 and the Apple II.
They also sold the exotic Olivetti M20, a very early 16 bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a Z8000 CPU.
After designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface.
They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas.
The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low.
Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80.
So they decided to designed a TRS-80 and CP/M software compatible computer system, which (following the lead of Apple Computer) they decided to name after a "typical Dutch flower".
So they called it the Aster CT-80 (CP/M/Tandy-1980).
Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that "Aster" is also a Dutch girls name has something to do with it.
Remarkably "Aster" was also the name given to a Dutch Supercomputer much later, in 2002.
The first version of the Aster consisted of four "Eurocard's", one Z80 CPU card with 64KB memory, one Motorola MC6845 based video card, one double density floppy disk controller card and one "keyboard/RS232/cassette interface" card.
Plus a "backplane card", (which connected all the other cards) and a keyboard.
And was intended for hobbyists, to be sold as a kit consisting of the parts and the PCB's for the computer and attached keyboard.
After selling a few kits, MCP became convinced there was a much bigger market for an improved model sold as a completed working system.
However the original kit version lacked many features that prevented its use as a serious computer system.
Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, (adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80/64 column text mode support, (with different size letters for TRS-80 and CP/M mode, so that in TRS-80 mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64x16 portion of the 80x25 screen) with an improved font set (adding "gray scale" version of the TRS-80 mozaik graphics and many special PETSCII like characters), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, (in the form of a 19-inch rack for the Eurocards) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply.
A software engineer was hired to write the special "dual boot mode" BIOS and the special CP/M BIOS.
The "dual boot mode" BIOS actually discovered whether a TRS-DOS, or Aster CP/M disk was placed in the drive, and would, depending on the type of disk, reorganise the internal memory architecture of the system, to either be 100% TRS-80 compatible or optimally support CP/M, with as much "workspace" as possible, and the 80x25 video mode.
It also was responsible for switching to ROM BASIC when the system was turned on with the break key pressed, and later supported a primitive LAN system, using the RS232 port with modified cabling.
The very first of the ready made computers were sold with the "kit" versions of the euro cards, the version with redesigned cards came a month or so later.
Soon the little shop became much too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby (formerly a window glass factory), and started mass-producing the Aster for a period of a few years, in which time its staff grew twentyfold.
After the Aster having been a few years on the Market Tandy released its own improved model, the TRS-80 Model III computer which solved many of the same problems that the Aster also had solved, but the model 3 still did not fully support CP/M as the Aster did.
In the meantime IBM had released its original IBM PC, which incidentally looked remarkably like the Asters base with floppy drives + separate keyboard set-up.
The aster was chosen for Dutch schools by the Dutch ministry of education, in a set-up with eight disk-less Asters, and one Aster with high capacity floppy drives all connected by a LAN based on the Asters high-speed serial port hardware, and special cables that permitted that any single computer on the LAN could broadcast to all other computers.
The floppy based system was operated by the teacher who could send programs from his floppy disk, and data, to the student's disk-less systems thanks to the special BIOS in those systems.
The students could send programs and data back to the teacher through the same LAN, or could save to a cassette recorder built into the disk-less units.
Through a special "video-switch" the teacher was also able to see a copy of each students display on his own screen.
About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.
Unfortunately, because of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.
Perhaps the Aster computer inspired another Dutch computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower — the Tulip's Tulip System-1 which appeared about the same time Aster folded.
Most of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) MSX system for a company called "Micro Technology b.v.".
Unreleased add ons.
To enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system).
A hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a SCSI interface, and the necessary software.
A working prototype was developed that added a 40MB hard disk.
On the software front, work was being done to implement the replacement for the aging "user interface" of CP/M, (the Command Console Processor CCP ) with the more modern ZCPR.
Finally a replacement for the aging Z80 processor was being developed in the form of an Intel 8086 board, and additional 512K 16 bit memory boards.
Such replacements of CPU and memory system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that was designed to support both 8 and 16 bit processors, and used a modular Eurocard based design with slots to spare for expansion.
In theory the system could support the Z80 and the 8086 simultaneously.
Plans were formulated to support CP/M-86 and even MS-DOS.
Unfortunately none of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before any of them could be released.
Atlanta Braves  The Atlanta Braves are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team in Atlanta, Georgia, playing in the Eastern Division of the National League.
The Braves have played home games at Turner Field since 1997 and play spring training games in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.
In 2017, the team is to move to SunTrust Park, a new stadium complex in the Cumberland district of Cobb County just north of the I-285 bypass.
The "Braves" name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for a Native American warrior.
They are nicknamed "the "Bravos"", and often referred to as "America's Team" in reference to the team's games being broadcast on the nationally available TBS from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a wide fan base.
From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period (omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there were no official division champions).
The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and they returned to the playoffs as the National League Wild Card in 2010.
The Braves advanced to the World Series five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995.
Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 16 divisional titles, 17 National League pennants, and three World Series championships—in 1914 as the Boston Braves, in 1957 as the Milwaukee Braves, and in 1995 in Atlanta.
The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities.
The club is one of the National League's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the Chicago Cubs) and was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings (not to be confused with the American League's Boston Red Sox).
They are considered "the oldest continuously playing team in major North American sports."
There is an argument as to which team is actually older, because, although the Cubs are a full season "older" (formed as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870), Chicago did not sponsor a White Stockings team for two seasons due to the Great Chicago Fire; therefore, the Braves have played more consecutive seasons.
After various name changes, the team eventually began operating as the Boston Braves, which lasted for most of the first half of the 20th century.
Then, in 1953, the team moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Braves, followed by the final move to Atlanta in 1966.
The team's tenure in Atlanta is noted for  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END>  breaking  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END> 's career home run record in 1974.
History.
Boston.
1870–1913.
The Cincinnati Red Stockings, established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season.
Player-manager  <START:person> Harry Wright <END> , with brother  <START:person> George <END>  and two other Cincinnati players, then went to Boston Massachusetts at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder  <START:person> Ivers Whitney Adams <END>  to form the nucleus of the "Boston Red Stockings", a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP).
The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports.
(The only other team that has been organized as long, the Chicago Cubs, did not play for the two years following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.)
Two young players hired away from the Forest City club of Rockford, Illinois, turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher  <START:person> Al Spalding <END>  (founder of Spalding sporting goods) and second baseman  <START:person> Ross Barnes <END> .
Led by the  <START:person> Wright <END>  brothers,  <START:person> Barnes <END> , and  <START:person> Spalding <END> , the Red Stockings dominated the National Association, winning four of that league's five championships.
The team became one of the National League's charter franchises in 1876, sometimes called the "Red Caps" (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member).
Boston came to be called the "Beaneaters" in 1883, while retaining red as the team color.
The Boston Red Caps played in the first game in the history of the National League, on Saturday, April 22, 1876, defeating the Athletics, 6-5.
Although somewhat stripped of talent in the National League's inaugural year, Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants.
The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants.
For most of that time, their manager was  <START:person> Frank Selee <END> .
The 1898 team finished 102–47, a club record for wins that would stand for almost a century.
Stars of those 1890s  <START:person> Beaneater <END>  teams included the "Heavenly Twins",  <START:person> Hugh Duffy <END>  and  <START:person> Tommy McCarthy <END> , as well as "Slidin'"  <START:person> Billy Hamilton <END> .
The team was decimated when the American League's new Boston entry set up shop in 1901.
Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match.
They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913, and lost 100 games five times.
In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in "The Sporting News Baseball Guide" during the 1940s when each team's entry had a history of its nickname(s).
See details in History of baseball team nicknames).
The American League club's owner,  <START:person> Charles Taylor <END> , wasted little time in adopting Red Sox as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic "Americans").
Media-driven nickname changes to the "Doves" in 1907 and the "Rustlers" in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck.
The team became the "Braves" for the first time in 1912.
Their owner,  <START:person> James Gaffney <END> , was a member of New York City's political machine, Tammany Hall, which used an Indian chief as their symbol.
1914: Miracle.
Two years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history.
After a dismal 4–18 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last place finish.
On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Dodgers.
The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place, "15 games" behind the league-leading New York Giants, who had won the previous three league pennants.
After a day off, the Braves started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41–12.
On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three from the New York Giants and moved into first place.
The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16–16.
They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.
They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.
Despite their amazing comeback, the Braves entered the World Series as a heavy underdog to  <START:person> Connie Mack <END> 's Philadelphia A's.
Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics—the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern World Series (the 1907 Series had one tied game) to win the world championship.
Meanwhile,  <START:person> Johnny Evers <END>  won the Chalmers Award.
The Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at Fenway Park, since their normal home, the South End Grounds, was too small.
However, the Braves' success inspired owner  <START:person> Gaffney <END>  to build a modern park, Braves Field, which opened in August 1915.
It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield.
The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.
1915–1953.
After contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932.
The lone highlight of those years came when Judge  <START:person> Emil Fuchs <END>  bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great  <START:person> Christy Mathewson <END> , back into the game.
However,  <START:person> Mathewson <END>  died in 1925, leaving  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  in control of the team.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome.
The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager  <START:person> Bill McKechnie <END> , but  <START:person> Fuchs <END> ' revenue was severely depleted due to the Great Depression.
Looking for a way to get more fans and more money,  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  worked out a deal with the New York Yankees to acquire  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END> , who had started his career with the Red Sox.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  made  <START:person> Ruth <END>  team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits.
He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals.
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  even suggested that  <START:person> Ruth <END> , who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once  <START:person> McKechnie <END>  stepped down—perhaps as early as 1936.
At first, it appeared that  <START:person> Ruth <END>  was the final piece the team needed in 1935.
On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 win over the Giants.
However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500
all year.
Events went downhill quickly.
While  <START:person> Ruth <END>  could still hit, he could do little else.
He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if  <START:person> Ruth <END>  were in the lineup.
It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and  <START:person> Fuchs <END> ' promise of a share of team profits was hot air.
In fact,  <START:person> Ruth <END>  discovered that  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  expected him to invest some of "his" money in the team.
Seeing a franchise in complete disarray,  <START:person> Ruth <END>  retired on June 1—only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three home runs of his career.
He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but  <START:person> Fuchs <END>  wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.
The Braves finished 38–115, the worst season in franchise history.
Their .248
winning percentage is the third-worst in baseball history, and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the 1899 Cleveland Spiders).
 <START:person> Fuchs <END>  lost control of the team in August 1935, and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the "Boston Bees".
This did little to change the team's fortunes.
After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate  <START:person> Lou Perini <END> , changed the nickname back to the Braves.
He immediately set about rebuilding the team.
World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of  <START:person> Warren Spahn <END>  to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.
In 1948, the team won the pennant, behind the pitching of  <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Johnny Sain <END> , who won 39 games between them.
The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, "Boston Post" writer  <START:person> Gerald Hern <END>  wrote this poem about the pair: The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as " <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Sain <END>  and pray for rain", entered the baseball vocabulary.
However, in the 1948 season, the Braves actually had the same record in games that  <START:person> Spahn <END>  and  <START:person> Sain <END>  started that the team had overall, in terms of winning percentage.
The 1948 World Series, which the Braves lost in six games to the Indians, turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston.
In 1950,  <START:person> Sam Jethroe <END>  became the team's first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18.
Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953,  <START:person> Perini <END> , who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to Milwaukee, where the Braves had their top farm club, the Brewers.
Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation.
 <START:person> Bill Veeck <END>  had tried to return his St. Louis Browns there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.
Milwaukee (1953–1965).
Milwaukee went wild over the Braves, who were welcomed as genuine heroes.
The Braves finished 92–62 in their first season in Milwaukee, and drew a then-NL record 1.8 million fans.
The success of the team was noted by many owners.
Not coincidentally, the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns, Brooklyn Dodgers, and New York Giants would leave their original hometowns within the next five years.
As the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive.
Sluggers  <START:person> Eddie Mathews <END>  and  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END>  drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee), while  <START:person> Warren Spahn <END> ,  <START:person> Lew Burdette <END> , and  <START:person> Bob Buhl <END>  anchored the rotation.
The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.
In 1957, the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's MVP season, as he led the National League in home runs and RBI.
Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run walk-off home run that gave the Braves a 4–2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and clinched the League championship.
The team then went on to its first World Series win in over 40 years, defeating the New York Yankees of Berra,  <START:person> Mantle <END> , and Ford in seven games.
 <START:person> Burdette <END> , the Series MVP, threw three complete game victories, giving up only two earned runs.
In 1958, the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the New York Yankees once more, thanks in part to the strength of  <START:person> Spahn <END> 's and  <START:person> Burdette <END> 's pitching.
But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP  <START:person> Bob Turley <END> 's pitching.
The 1959 season saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers, both with 86-68 records.
Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about 75 mi apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers.
The Dodgers would go on to defeat the Chicago White Sox in the World Series.
The next six years were up-and-down for the Braves.
The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by  <START:person> Burdette <END>  and  <START:person> Spahn <END> , and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, who ultimately were to win the World Series that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher  <START:person> Harvey Haddix <END> .
The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite  <START:person> Spahn <END>  recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  hit 45 home runs in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth.
The next season,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and  <START:person> Spahn <END>  was once again the ace of the staff, going 23–7.
However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the lower half of the league, or "second division", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.
The Braves were somewhat mediocre as the 1960s began, but fattened up on the expansion New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s.
To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team who played more than one season and never had a losing record.
 <START:person> Perini <END>  sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by  <START:person> William Bartholomay <END>  in 1962.
Almost immediately  <START:person> Bartholomay <END>  started shopping the Braves to a larger television market.
Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor  <START:person> Ivan Allen <END> ,  <START:person> Jr. <END>  constructed a new $18 million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, Atlanta Stadium, which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team.
After the city failed to lure the Kansas City A's to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season.
However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year.
In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.
 <START:person> Eddie Mathews <END>  is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in.
 <START:person> Mathews <END>  played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.
Atlanta.
1966–1974.
The Braves were a .500
team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85–77 in 1966, 77–85 in 1967, and 81–81 in 1968.
The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston.
In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever National League West Division title, before being swept by the "Miracle Mets" in the National League Championship Series.
They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 – in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.
In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of  <START:person> Hank Aaron <END> .
In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium ("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production.
Atlanta also produced batting champions in  <START:person> Rico Carty <END>  (in 1970) and  <START:person> Ralph Garr <END>  (in 1974).
In the shadow of  <START:person> Aaron <END> 's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 –  <START:person> Darrell Evans <END> ,  <START:person> Davey Johnson <END>  and, of course,  <START:person> Aaron <END> .
By the end of the 1973 season,  <START:person> Aaron <END>  had hit 713 home runs, one short of  <START:person> Ruth <END> 's record.
Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure.
The next season, it was only a matter of time before he set a new record.
On April 4, opening day, he hit No.714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience he finally beat  <START:person> Ruth <END> 's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <START:person> Aaron <END>  spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before asking to be traded to the Milwaukee Brewers, while  <START:person> Ruth <END>  finished his career as a Boston Brave.
In fact, until  <START:person> Barry Bonds <END>  eclipsed the 714 home runs hit by  <START:person> Babe Ruth <END>  in 2006, the top two home run hitters in Major League history had at one time been Braves.
1976–77:  <START:person> Ted Turner <END>  buys the team.
In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> , owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta.
The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment.
It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
 <START:person> Turner <END>  quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner.
On May 11, 1977,  <START:person> Turner <END>  appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2–1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).
Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base.
WTBS marketed the team as "The Atlanta Braves: America's Team", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South.
Among other things, in 1976  <START:person> Turner <END>  suggested the nickname "Channel" for pitcher  <START:person> Andy Messersmith <END>  and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired Braves games.
Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.
1978–1990.
After three straight losing seasons,  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season.
He promoted 22-year-old slugger  <START:person> Dale Murphy <END>  into the starting lineup.
 <START:person> Murphy <END>  hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base.
In 1980,  <START:person> Murphy <END>  was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974.
 <START:person> Cox <END>  was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with  <START:person> Joe Torre <END> , under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969.
Strong performances from  <START:person> Bob Horner <END> ,  <START:person> Chris Chambliss <END> , pitcher  <START:person> Phil Niekro <END> , and short relief pitcher  <START:person> Gene Garber <END>  helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than  <START:person> Murphy <END> , who won both a Most Valuable Player and a Gold Glove award.
 <START:person> Murphy <END>  also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s.
 <START:person> Murphy <END> , excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990.
Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games.
The 1986 season saw the return of  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  as general manager.
Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Native American-themed mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa.
1991–2004: Division dominance.
1991–1994.
 <START:person> Cox <END>  returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing  <START:person> Russ Nixon <END> .
The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97.
They traded  <START:person> Dale Murphy <END>  to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player.
Pitching coach  <START:person> Leo Mazzone <END>  began developing young pitchers  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END> ,  <START:person> Steve Avery <END> , and  <START:person> John Smoltz <END>  into future stars.
That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB Draft to select  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END> , who became one of the best hitters in team history.
Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office.
Immediately after the season,  <START:person> John Schuerholz <END>  was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.
The following season,  <START:person> Glavine <END> ,  <START:person> Avery <END> , and  <START:person> Smoltz <END>  would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them.
Meanwhile, behind position players  <START:person> David Justice <END> ,  <START:person> Ron Gant <END>  and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion  <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END> , the Braves overcame a 39–40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races.
The "Worst to First" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag.
They defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in a very tightly contested seven-game NLCS only to lose the World Series, also in seven games, to the Minnesota Twins.
The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.
Despite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue.
In 1992, the Braves returned to the NLCS and once again defeated the Pirates in seven games, culminating in a dramatic game seven win.
 <START:person> Francisco Cabrera <END> 's two-out single that scored  <START:person> David Justice <END>  and  <START:person> Sid Bream <END>  capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3–2 victory.
It was the first time in post season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning.
The Braves lost the World Series to the Toronto Blue Jays, however.
In 1993, the Braves signed Cy Young Award winning pitcher  <START:person> Greg Maddux <END>  from the Chicago Cubs, leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball.
The 1993 team posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the San Francisco Giants, who won 103 games.
The Braves needed a stunning 55–19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11.
However, the Braves fell in the NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.
In 1994, in a realignment of the National League's divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.
This realignment was the main cause of the team's heated rivalry with the New York Mets during the mid-to-late 1990s.
The player's strike cut short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the Montreal Expos with 48 games left to play.
1995–2004.
The Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series.
This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the "Buffalo Bills of Baseball" (January 1996 issue of "Beckett Baseball Card Monthly").
With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities.
With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the 1996 and 1999 World Series (losing both to the New York Yankees, managed by  <START:person> Joe Torre <END> , a former Braves manager), and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early.
Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization —Cox was the Braves' manager, while  <START:person> Schuerholz <END>  remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president.
 <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END>  finished his playing career elsewhere, but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.
In October 1996, Time Warner acquired  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> 's Turner Broadcasting System and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves.
Over the next few years,  <START:person> Ted Turner <END> 's presence as owner of the team would diminish.
A 95–67 record in 2000 produced a ninth consecutive division title.
However, a sweep at the hands of the St. Louis Cardinals prevented the Braves from reaching the National League Championship Series for a ninth consecutive time.
In 2001, Atlanta won the National League East division yet again, swept the Houston Astros in the NLDS, then lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Championship Series four games to one.
One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played rival New York Mets in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since 9/11.
In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Houston Astros.
 <START:person> Cy Young <END>  dominance.
Six National League Cy Young Awards in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers: 2005: A new generation.
In 2005, the Braves won the Division championship for the fourteenth consecutive time from 1991 to 2005.
Fourteen consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball.
The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs ( <START:person> Wilson Betemit <END> ,  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> ,  <START:person> Pete Orr <END> ,  <START:person> Ryan Langerhans <END> ,  <START:person> Jeff Francoeur <END> ).
Catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> , right fielder  <START:person> Jeff Francoeur <END> , and pitcher  <START:person> Kyle Davies <END>  all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta.
The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the "Baby Braves" by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to a record of 90–72.
However, the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the National League Division Series to the Astros in four games.
In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros battled back with a  <START:person> Lance Berkman <END>  grand slam and a two-out, ninth inning  <START:person> Brad Ausmus <END>  home run off of Braves closer  <START:person> Kyle Farnsworth <END> .
The game did not end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50 minutes.
 <START:person> Chris Burke <END>  ended the marathon with a home run off of  <START:person> Joey Devine <END> .
After the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach  <START:person> Leo Mazzone <END> , who left to go to the Baltimore Orioles.
 <START:person> Roger McDowell <END>  took his place in the Atlanta dugout.
Unable to re-sign shortstop  <START:person> Rafael Furcal <END> , the Braves acquired shortstop  <START:person> Edgar Rentería <END>  from the Boston Red Sox.
2006: Struggles.
In 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to.
Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6–21 record for the month of June, the worst month ever in the city of Atlanta, and just percentage points better than the Boston Braves of May 1935 (4–20).
The Braves made their move in July, going 14–10.
However, the team remained in the bottom half of the NL East and trailed the Mets by a double-digit deficit for much of the season (13 games at the All-Star Break).
However, despite their struggles, the Braves entered the break down by only six and a half games to the Dodgers for the NL Wild Card slot after winning seven of their last ten games.
After the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records.
They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span.
The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the Boston Beaneaters totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 – June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the 1930 New York Yankees to score ten runs or more in five straight games.
The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8–3 victory over Cincinnati on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break.
Additionally,  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie  <START:person> Paul Waner <END> 's 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.
The Braves made their first trade of the season on July 20 to shore up the bullpen, sending Class A Rome catcher  <START:person> Max Ramirez <END>  to Cleveland for closer  <START:person> Bob Wickman <END> .
He served as the Braves' closer for the remainder of the season, taking over for an embattled  <START:person> Jorge Sosa <END> , who was subsequently traded on the July 31 trade deadline for St. Louis minor league pitcher  <START:person> Rich Scalamandre <END> .
On July 29, the Braves traded reserve third baseman/shortstop  <START:person> Wilson Betemit <END>  to the Los Angeles Dodgers for reliever  <START:person> Danys Báez <END>  and infielder  <START:person> Willy Aybar <END> .
The move came on the night that starting third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  went on the 15-day disabled list with a strained oblique muscle.
With  <START:person> Betemit <END>  gone, Atlanta called up infielder  <START:person> Tony Pena <END> , Jr. from AAA Richmond to supplement  <START:person> Pete Orr <END> .
Before the expansion of rosters on September 1, the Braves acquired  <START:person> Daryle Ward <END>  from the Washington Nationals for Class A Myrtle Beach pitcher  <START:person> Luis Atilano <END> , in hopes that he would be a valuable pinch-hitter in the postseason.
However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the Florida Marlins mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves' eleven-year reign over the NL East.
On September 24, the Braves' loss to the Colorado Rockies mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season.
Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990.
Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie  <START:person> Chuck James <END>  besting  <START:person> Roger Clemens <END> , Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79–83.
After the season, the Atlanta coaching staff underwent a few changes.
 <START:person> Brian Snitker <END>  became the third base coach after  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  left to become the manager for the Florida Marlins.
 <START:person> Chino Cadahia <END>  replaced  <START:person> Pat Corrales <END>  as bench coach and former catcher  <START:person> Eddie Pérez <END>  became the new bullpen coach, replacing  <START:person> Bobby Dews <END> .
Sale to Liberty Media.
In December 2005, team owner Time Warner, who inherited the Braves after purchasing TBS in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale.
Liberty Media began negotiations to purchase the team.
In February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal that would sell the Braves to Liberty Media Group (a company which owned a large amount of stock in Time Warner, Inc.), pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball,  <START:person> Bud Selig <END> .
The deal included the exchange of the Braves, valued in the deal at $450 million, a hobbyist magazine publishing company, and $980 million cash, for 68.5 million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty Media, then worth approximately $1.48 billion.
Team President  <START:person> Terry McGuirk <END>  anticipated no change in the current front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day operations of the Braves.
Liberty Media is not expected to take any type of "active" ownership in terms of day-to-day operations.
On May 16, 2007, Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale of the Braves from Time Warner to Liberty Media.
2007: More struggles.
The Braves made their first moves by re-signing  <START:person> Bob Wickman <END>  to a one-year deal and picking up  <START:person> John Smoltz <END> 's option in September 2006.
They traded starting pitcher  <START:person> Horacio Ramírez <END>  to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher  <START:person> Rafael Soriano <END> , an American League reliever with a 2.20 ERA in 2006.
They also denied arbitration to pitcher  <START:person> Chris Reitsma <END>  and second baseman  <START:person> Marcus Giles <END> .
The Braves signed utility-man  <START:person> Chris Woodward <END>  to fill a spot on the bench.
The biggest trade in the offseason involved first baseman  <START:person> Adam LaRoche <END>  and a minor league player for Pittsburgh Pirates closer  <START:person> Mike González <END>  and a minor league infielder,  <START:person> Brent Lillibridge <END> .
 <START:person> Gonzalez <END> , who converted 24 of 24 save opportunities in 2006, joined  <START:person> Soriano <END>  as a set-up man for  <START:person> Wickman <END>  in the bullpen.
The team then signed  <START:person> Craig Wilson <END>  to a one-year deal to platoon with  <START:person> Scott Thorman <END> .
The Braves also had solid relievers in  <START:person> Macay McBride <END> ,  <START:person> Blaine Boyer <END> , and  <START:person> Tyler Yates <END> .
In addition, the majority of the Braves' offense, which was second in the NL in runs scored in 2006, returned in 2007.
However,  <START:person> Mike Hampton <END>  was sidelined for the entire 2007 season with yet another surgery.
 <START:person> Mike González <END>  was later sidelined for the season while recovering from  <START:person> Tommy John <END>  surgery.
The Braves' bullpen and offense came through in the clutch early on, helping the Braves to a 7–1 start, their best start since winning the World Series in 1995.
The team finished April with a 16–9 record, but struggled during May, finishing 14–14.
The Braves also struggled during interleague play, finishing with an NL-worst 4–11 record.
On June 24, the Braves fell to .500 for the first time in the 2007 season, but rebounded by winning the next 5 games.
On July 5,  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  surpassed  <START:person> Dale Murphy <END>  for the Atlanta club record of 372 home runs by belting two against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
On July 31, 2007, the Braves finalized the deal to acquire slugger first baseman  <START:person> Mark Teixeira <END>  and LHP  <START:person> Ron Mahay <END>  from the Texas Rangers for catcher  <START:person> Jarrod Saltalamacchia <END> , SS  <START:person> Elvis Andrus <END> , and three minor-leaguers.
The Braves also acquired  <START:person> Octavio Dotel <END>  from the Kansas City Royals for  <START:person> Kyle Davies <END>  and also traded LHP  <START:person> Wilfredo Ledezma <END>  and RHP Will Startup to the San Diego Padres for Royce Ring.
On August 19, 2007  <START:person> John Smoltz <END>  passed  <START:person> Phil Niekro <END>  for 1st place on the Braves' all-time strikeout list.
Braves manager  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  broke the all-time MLB record for most career ejections by a manager in August 2007.
After struggling during the second half of the 2007 season, Atlanta finished over .500
and missed the post season again.
On October 12, 2007,  <START:person> John Schuerholz <END>  stepped down as General Manager to take over as team president.
Assistant GM  <START:person> Frank Wren <END>  took over as General Manager.
2008: Plagued by injuries.
In December 2007, the team announced it would not re-sign center fielder  <START:person> Andruw Jones <END>  (who later would sign with the Dodgers).
Another major move was acquiring CF  <START:person> Gorkys Hernández <END>  and RHP  <START:person> Jair Jurrjens <END>  from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for SS  <START:person> Edgar Rentería <END>  and cash considerations.
Next, LHP  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END>  was signed to a one-year contract.
They also acquired LHP  <START:person> Will Ohman <END>  and INF  <START:person> Omar Infante <END>  from the Cubs in exchange for RHP  <START:person> José Ascanio <END> .
The team's first new move for 2008 was acquiring OF  <START:person> Mark Kotsay <END>  from the A's (to replace  <START:person> Jones <END> ) in exchange for RHP  <START:person> Joey Devine <END> , RHP  <START:person> Jamie Richmond <END>  and cash considerations.
Days later,  <START:person> Wren <END>  traded  <START:person> Willy Aybar <END> , outfielder  <START:person> Tom Lindsey <END> , and infielder  <START:person> Chase Fontaine <END>  to the Rays in exchange for left-hand reliever  <START:person> Jeff Ridgway <END> .
Before the trade deadline the Braves traded 1B  <START:person> Mark Teixeira <END>  to the Los Angeles Angels for first baseman  <START:person> Casey Kotchman <END>  and minor league RHP  <START:person> Stephen Marek <END> .
The Braves failed to make the playoffs for the third straight season.
2009: The return of solid pitching.
On December 4, 2008, the Atlanta Braves received  <START:person> Javier Vázquez <END>  and  <START:person> Boone Logan <END> , while the Chicago White Sox received prospects catcher  <START:person> Tyler Flowers <END> , shortstop  <START:person> Brent Lillibridge <END> , third baseman  <START:person> Jon Gilmore <END>  and pitcher  <START:person> Santos Rodriguez <END> .
On January 13, 2009, the Braves signed Japanese pitcher  <START:person> Kenshin Kawakami <END>  to a three-year deal, and two days later signed free agent pitcher  <START:person> Derek Lowe <END>  to a four-year contract.
During the course of the offseason, the Braves signed veteran pitcher and former Brave  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END> , while losing long-time Brave  <START:person> John Smoltz <END>  to the Boston Red Sox.
On February 25, 2009, just before the start of spring training, Atlanta agreed to terms on a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder  <START:person> Garret Anderson <END> .
The additional outfield depth allowed the Braves to trade  <START:person> Josh Anderson <END>  to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher  <START:person> Rudy Darrow <END>  on March 30, 2009.
On June 3, 2009, the Braves acquired  <START:person> Nate McLouth <END>  from the Pittsburgh Pirates for prospects  <START:person> Jeff Locke <END> ,  <START:person> Charlie Morton <END>  and  <START:person> Gorkys Hernández <END> .
They also released veteran pitcher  <START:person> Tom Glavine <END> .
On July 10, 2009, the Braves traded outfielder  <START:person> Jeff Francoeur <END>  to the New York Mets for outfielder  <START:person> Ryan Church <END> .
On July 31, 2009, hours before the trade deadline, the Braves and Boston Red Sox swapped 1st basemen: Atlanta dealt  <START:person> Casey Kotchman <END>  to Boston and reacquired  <START:person> Adam LaRoche <END> , whom the Braves had traded away during the 2006–07 off-season to Pittsburgh.
The Braves made a late-season surge, coming within 2 games of the wild card leading Colorado Rockies in late September.
On October 1, 2009 with the Braves four games back, Colorado beat the Milwaukee Brewers 9–2 to clinch the wild card spot and end the Braves' 2009 postseason hopes.
2010: Cox's final season.
The 2010 Atlanta Braves Season features the Braves' attempt to reclaim a postseason berth for the first time since 2005.
The Braves were once again skippered by  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END> , now in his 25th and final season managing the team.
The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April.
Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since 2000 when they won 16 in a row.
On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place Philadelphia Phillies at Turner Field to take sole possession of first place in the National League East standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August.
The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in 2005.
On July 13, 2010 at the 2010 MLB All-Star Game in Anaheim, Braves catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END>  was awarded the All-Star Game MVP Award for his clutch two-out, three-run double in the seventh inning to give the National League its first win in the All-Star Game since 1996.
He became the first Brave to win the All-Star Game MVP Award since  <START:person> Fred McGriff <END>  did so in 1994.
The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire Álex González,  <START:person> Rick Ankiel <END>  and  <START:person> Kyle Farnsworth <END>  from the Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals, giving up shortstop  <START:person> Yunel Escobar <END> , pitchers  <START:person> Jo-Jo Reyes <END>  and  <START:person> Jesse Chavez <END> , outfielder  <START:person> Gregor Blanco <END>  and three minor leaguers.
On August 18, 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman  <START:person> Derrek Lee <END>  from the Chicago Cubs.
On August 22, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs,  <START:person> Mike Minor <END>  struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record.
The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September, but won the NL Wild Card.
They lost to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four games.
Every game of the series was determined by one run.
After the series-clinching victory for the Giants in Game 4,  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  was given a standing ovation by the fans, also by players and coaches of both the Braves and Giants.
2011:  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  takes over.
On October 13, 2010, the Atlanta Braves announced that  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  would replace long-time Braves manager  <START:person> Bobby Cox <END>  as manager of the team in 2011.
The announcement came just two days after the 2010 Braves were eliminated from the postseason.
It was also announced that pitching coach  <START:person> Roger McDowell <END> , third-base coach  <START:person> Brian Snitker <END> , and bullpen coach  <START:person> Eddie Pérez <END>  would retain their current positions, while former hitting coach  <START:person> Terry Pendleton <END>  would replace  <START:person> Glenn Hubbard <END>  as the first-base coach and newcomer  <START:person> Carlos Tosca <END>  would become the new bench coach.
 <START:person> Hubbard <END>  and former bench coach  <START:person> Chino Cadahia <END>  were not offered positions on the new coaching staff.
 <START:person> Larry Parrish <END>  was hired as hitting coach on October 29, 2010.
On November 16, 2010 in an offseason trade, the Braves acquired  <START:person> Dan Uggla <END>  from the Florida Marlins in exchange for left-handed reliever  <START:person> Mike Dunn <END>  and infielder  <START:person> Omar Infante <END> .
According to Elias Sports Bureau, the Braves had an all-time franchise win-loss record over .500
for the first time since 1923 after their win over the Houston Astros on June 11, 2011.
The Braves franchise became the third franchise in MLB history to reach 10,000 wins with their win over the Washington Nationals on July 15, 2011.
On July 31, 2011, just sixteen days after registering their 10,000th win, the Florida Marlins defeated the Braves by a score of 3-1, handing the team the 10,000th loss in franchise history.
The Braves become only the second team in big league history with 10,000 losses after the Philadelphia Phillies reached the plateau in 2007.
Players from the Braves' farm system, such as  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  and  <START:person> Brandon Beachy <END> , played regularly with the big league club, while  <START:person> Julio Teherán <END> ,  <START:person> Randall Delgado <END> , and  <START:person> Mike Minor <END>  were called up for spot starts.
With late season injuries to starters  <START:person> Jair Jurrjens <END>  and  <START:person> Tommy Hanson <END> , these three young pitchers made their way into the starting rotation in their absence.
Eight players made their major league debuts for the team in 2011.
September collapse.
The Braves led the National League Wild Card standings for much of the 2011 season, with the division-rival Philadelphia Phillies firmly in control of first place in the National League East.
The Braves entered the final month of the regular season 25 games above .500
with a record of 80–55 and an 8 1⁄2-game lead in the Wild Card standings.
The nearest team trailing them, the St. Louis Cardinals, who also trailed the National League Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers by 8 1⁄2 games at the time, were considered a long-shot to gain a spot in the postseason.
Just days prior on August 26, the Cardinals found themselves 10 1⁄2 games behind and in third place.
With 27 games to play, the Braves went 9–18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89–73.
The Cardinals, meanwhile, went 18–8 to finish at 90–72.
Braves closer  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END> , who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August, carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves.
After being dominant in his role for much of the season, Braves setup man  <START:person> Jonny Venters <END>  posted a 5.11 September ERA.
These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by Braves manager  <START:person> Fredi González <END> .
Veteran starter  <START:person> Derek Lowe <END>  posted a win-loss record of 0–5 in September with an ERA of 8.75.
Shortly into the offseason,  <START:person> Lowe <END>  would be traded to the Cleveland Indians.
The Braves starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games.
Over the last five games, all of which were losses for the Braves, the team managed to score only seven runs.
Braves catcher  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> , often regarded as the best offensive catcher in the Majors, hit only .183 with two home runs in September.
The offense as a whole hit for only a .235
batting average and a .300
on-base percentage in September, both second-worst in the National League.
The .195
RISP average by Braves hitters was second worst in the Majors.
Hitting coach  <START:person> Larry Parrish <END>  was fired two days following the last game of the season.
2012:  <START:person> Chipper <END> 's last season.
In 2012, the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season.
On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team.
The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher  <START:person> Derek Lowe <END> , shortstop  <START:person> Alex González <END> , and outfielder  <START:person> Nate McLouth <END> .
To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder  <START:person> Michael Bourn <END> , along with shortstops  <START:person> Tyler Pastornicky <END>  and  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END> .
To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by  <START:person> Lowe <END>  (as well as a mid-season injury to  <START:person> Brandon Beachy <END> ), manager  <START:person> Fredi González <END>  elected relief pitcher  <START:person> Kris Medlen <END>  to the starting pitching rotation.
The Braves went on to win every game  <START:person> Medlen <END>  started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23).
Atlanta stayed close to the Washington Nationals in the race to win the National League East title.
They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race.
Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild card race.
Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a playoff game before entering into the Division Series.
The Braves played the St. Louis Cardinals in the first ever Wild Card Game.
The Braves were behind 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END>  hit a fly ball to left field that dropped in between the Cardinals shortstop and left fielder.
Umpire  <START:person> Sam Holbrook <END>  called  <START:person> Simmons <END>  out, citing the infield fly rule.
Had an infield fly not been called,  <START:person> Simmons <END>  would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out.
Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes.
The Braves lost the game 6–3, ending their season.
2013: Braves win the East.
During the offseason following a gut wrenching exit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the Wild Card Game, the Braves spent the 2012-2013 offseason revamping and retooling their offense.
The Braves turned heads across baseball by acquiring  <START:person> B.J. Upton <END>  from the Tampa Bay Rays, signing him to a 5-year $75.25 million contract and making him their starting center fielder, and uniting him with his younger brother  <START:person> Justin Upton <END>  from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a seven player trade that sent fan favorite utility man  <START:person> Martin Prado <END>  to the Diamondbacks, they also filled a need for a new Third Baseman in  <START:person> Chris Johnson <END>  after the retirement of  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  the previous year.
The Braves began the 2013 season with a hot start in April by going 17-9 for the month, which saw the emergence of rookie sensation  <START:person> Evan Gattis <END> , while taking hold of first place in the National League East division, a lead they would never relinquish for the rest of the season.
The Braves suffered many injuries to key players throughout the season, including injuries to  <START:person> Jason Heyward <END> ,  <START:person> Brian McCann <END> ,  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END> ,  <START:person> Eric O'Flaherty <END> ,  <START:person> Jonny Venters <END> ,  <START:person> Ramiro Pena <END>  and others, but found a way to win despite these blows to the team.
Leading up to the All Star break, First Baseman  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  was voted in to play for the 2013 National League All-Star Team, in the 2013 All Star Game, which he did not play.
The Braves also witnessed the emergence of rookie pitcher  <START:person> Julio Teheran <END>  after much hype during Spring Training.
From July 26 to August 10, the Braves won 14 games in a row.
The winning streak was the longest of its kind since April–May 2000.
On June 28, 2013 the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman  <START:person> Chipper Jones <END> ' jersey, number 10, before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
He was honored before 51,300 fans at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia.
He served as a staple of the Braves franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season.
 <START:person> Chipper Jones <END>  played his last regular season game for the Braves on September 30, 2012.
The Braves opened up a 15-game lead on the Washington Nationals in the National League East on September 3, 2013, riding that lead en route to its first division title since 2005, the last of 14 straight division titles.
This was also Braves manager  <START:person> Fredi Gonzalez <END> 's first division title since beginning his managerial career in 1990; including his first since becoming the manager of the Braves after the 2010 season.
The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22, 2013 after a Nationals loss to the Marlins in the first game of a double header; the Braves also won their game that day, beating the Chicago Cubs 5-2 at Wrigley Field.
2014.
On November 11, 2013, the Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field for a new stadium in Cobb County, in the northwest suburbs outside of Atlanta in 2017.
The move is to follow the expiration of the Braves' 20-year lease on Turner Field in 2016.
The new stadium is to be constructed in a public/private partnership.
During the offseason the Braves signed few of their young talents to multi year contracts;  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END>  (4 years/$42M),  <START:person> Freddie Freeman <END>  (8 years/$135M),  <START:person> Kris Medlen <END>  (1 year/$5.8M),
 <START:person> Jason Heyward <END>  (2 years/$13.3M),
 <START:person> Julio Teherán <END>  (6 years/$32.4M)
and  <START:person> Andrelton Simmons <END>  (7 years/$58M).
The Braves finished the season in a distant second place with a 79-83 record, which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990.
2015.
Prior to the 2015 season, the Braves fired their General Manager  <START:person> Frank Wren <END> , and  <START:person> John Hart <END>  replaced him as interim GM, choosing to only take the title of President of Baseball Operations.
The Braves promptly traded Gold Glove Award winner  <START:person> Jason Heyward <END>  to the St. Louis Cardinals along with pitcher  <START:person> Jordan Walden <END>  for pitchers  <START:person> Shelby Miller <END>  and  <START:person> Tyrell Jenkins <END> .
 <START:person> Hart <END>  would then trade All Star left fielder  <START:person> Justin Upton <END>  to the San Diego Padres for Max Fried,  <START:person> Jace Peterson <END> ,  <START:person> Dustin Peterson <END> , and  <START:person> Mallex Smith <END> .
Catcher  <START:person> Evan Gattis <END>  and minor league prospect  <START:person> James Hoyt <END>  were traded to the Houston Astros for minor leaguers  <START:person> Mike Foltynewicz <END> ,  <START:person> Rio Ruiz <END> , and  <START:person> Andrew Thurman <END> .
A day before the season began, the braves made a final trade involving former AllStar  <START:person> Craig Kimbrel <END>  and outfielder  <START:person> Melvin Upton Jr <END> ..
They were traded to the San Diego Padres for outfielders  <START:person> Cameron Maybin <END>  and  <START:person> Carlos Quentin <END>  along with two minor league players.
By the beginning of the season, the Braves did 11 trades in all.

Acadia University  Acadia University is a predominantly undergraduate university located in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada with some graduate programs at the master's level and one at the doctoral level.
The enabling legislation consists of Acadia University Act and the Amended Acadia University Act 2000.
The Wolfville Campus houses Acadia University Archives and the Acadia University Art Gallery.
Acadia offers over 200 degree combinations in the Faculties of Arts, Pure and Applied Science, Professional Studies, and Theology.
The student-faculty ratio is 15:1 and the average class size is 28.
Open Acadia offers correspondence and distance education courses.
History.
Acadia began as an extension of Horton Academy (1828), which was founded in Horton, Nova Scotia, by Baptists from Nova Scotia and Queen's College (1838).
The College was later named Acadia College.
Acadia University, established at Wolfville, Nova Scotia in 1838 has a strong Baptist religious affiliation.
It was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members.
The two major Universities of the day in Nova Scotia were heavily controlled by Denominational structures.
King's College (University of King's College) was an Anglican School and Dalhousie University, which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the Church of Scotland.
It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar,  <START:person> Edmund Crawley <END> , to the Chair of Classics, as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a College established and run by the Baptists.
In 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for  <START:person> Queen Victoria <END> ).
The College began with 21 students in January 1839.
The name "Queen's College" was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed "Acadia College" in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an Acadian settlement.
Acadia College awarded its first degrees in 1843 and became Acadia University in 1891, established by the Acadia University Act.
The Granville Street Baptist Church (now First Baptist Church (Halifax)) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the University.
It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development.
Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president  <START:person> John Pryor <END> , were members of the First Baptist Church Halifax congregation.
Similarly, the adjacent Wolfville United Baptist Church plays a significant role in the life of the university.
The original charter of the college stated: And be it further enacted, that no religious tests or subscriptions shall be required of the Professors Fellows, Scholars, Graduates or Officers of the said College; but that all the privileges and advantages thereof shall be open and free to all and every Person and Persons whomsoever, without regard to religious persuasion ...
And it shall and may be lawful for the trustees and Governors of the said College to select as Professors, and other Teaches or Officers, competent persons of any religious persuasion whatever, provided such person or persons shall be of moral and religious character.
This was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff.
In 1851, the power of appointing governors was transferred from the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces.
 <START:person> Charles Osborne Wickenden <END>  (architect), and  <START:person> J.C. Dumaresq <END>  designed the Central Building, Acadia College, 1878–79.
 <START:person> Clara Belle Marshall <END> , from Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia, became the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879.
In 1891, there were changes in the Act of Incorporation.
The War Memorial House (more generally known as Barrax), which is a residence, and War Memorial Gymnasium  are landmark buildings on the campus of Acadia University.
The Memorial Hall and Gymnasium honours students who had enlisted and died in the First World War, and in the Second World War.
Two granite shafts, which are part of the War Memorial Gymnasium complex at Acadia University, are dedicated to the university's war dead.
The War Memorial House is dedicated to the war dead from Acadia University during the Second World War   <START:person> Andrew R. Cobb <END>  designed several campus buildings including: Raynor Hall Residence, 1916; , designed by  <START:person> Cobb <END>  in the Georgian style, and built by  <START:person> James Reid <END>  of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia was opened in 1915 as Horton Academy.
Today,  <START:person> Horton Hall <END>  is the home of the Department of Psychology and Research and Graduate Studies.
 <START:person> Emmerson Hall <END> , built in 1913, is particularly interesting for the variety of building stones used.
In 1967  <START:person> Emmerson Hall <END>  was converted to classrooms and offices for the School of Education.
It is a registered Heritage Property.
Unveiled on 16 August 1963, a wooden and metal organ in Manning Chapel, Acadia University, is dedicated to Acadia University's war dead of the First World War.
A memorial pipe organ in Convovation Hall, Acadia University is dedicated to the members of Acadia University killed during the First World War A book of remembrance in Manning Chapel, Acadia University was unveiled on 1 March 1998 through the efforts of the Wolfville Historical Society  In 1966, the Baptist denomination relinquished direct control over the University.
The denomination maintains nine seats on the University's Board of Governors.
On 4 January 2008, Dr.  <START:person> Gail Dinter-Gottlieb <END>  decided to step down as President and Vice Chancellor of the University before her term expired.
Her resignation was effective 29 February 2008.
 <START:person> Ray Ivany <END>  began his position as President and Vice-Chancellor on 1 April 2009.
Faculty strikes.
Acadia University's Board of Governors and members of the Acadia University Faculty Association (AUFA) have ratified a new covering the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2014.
The faculty of Acadia University have been on strike twice in the history of the institution.
The first was 24 February to 12 March 2004.
The second was 15 October to 5 November 2007.
The second strike was resolved after the province's labour minister,  <START:person> Mark Parent <END> , appointed a mediator, on 1 November, to facilitate an agreement.
Academics.
Profile.
As a primarily undergraduate institution, the university places significant importance on teaching and instruction.
The mission of Acadia University is to provide a personalized and rigorous liberal education; promote a robust and respectful scholarly community; and inspire a diversity of students to become critical thinkers, lifelong learners, engaged citizens, and responsible global leaders.
Rankings.
Acadia University is consistently ranked among the top universities in Canada for undergraduate studies in the  <START:person> Maclean <END> 's comprehensive Canadian Universities rankings, coming second in Canada for the 2014 academic year and among the top five for the past decade.
This has been attributed to Acadia's small class size and close relationships between the faculty and the students.
Faculties.
Acadia is organized into four faculties: Arts, Pure & Applied Science, Professional Studies and Theology.
Each faculty is further divided into departments and schools specialized in areas of teaching and research.
Research.
The Division of Research & Graduate Studies is separate from the faculties and oversees graduate students as well as Acadia's research programs.
Acadia's research programs explore coastal environments, ethno-cultural diversity, social justice, environmental monitoring and climate change, organizational relationships, data mining, the impact of digital technologies, and lifestyle choices contributing to health and wellness.
Acadia's research centres include the Tidal Energy Institute, and the Beaubassin Field Station.
Applied research opportunities include research with local wineries and grape growers, alternative insect control techniques and technologies.
Innovation.
The Acadia Advantage.
In 1996, Acadia University pioneered the use of mobile computing technology in a post-secondary educational environment.
This academic initiative, named the Acadia Advantage, integrated the use of notebook computers into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching.
By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were taking part in the initiative.
The initiative went beyond leasing notebook computers to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond.
Because of its pioneering efforts, Acadia is a laureate of Washington's Smithsonian Institution and a part of the permanent research collection of the National Museum of American History.
It is the only Canadian university selected for inclusion in the Education and Academia category of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award.
In addition, Acadia University received the Pioneer Award for Ubiquitous Computing.
In 2001, it achieved high rankings in the annual "Maclean's" University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum.
In October 2006, Dr.  <START:person> Dinter-Gottlieb <END>  established a commission to review the Acadia Advantage learning environment 10 years after inception.
The mandate of the commission was to determine how well the current Advantage program meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff and to examine how the role of technology in the postsecondary environment has changed at Acadia, and elsewhere.
The commission was asked to recommend changes and enhancements to the Acadia Advantage that would benefit the entire university community and ensure its sustainability.
Some of the recommendations coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased notebook computers to a student-owned computer model.
The compelling rationale for this was the integral role technology now plays in our lives, which was not present in 1996.
The University was also advised to unbundle its tuition structure so that the cost of an Acadia education is more detailed and students can understand how their investment in the future of the school is allotted.
In September 2008, Acadia moved to a student-owned notebook computer version of the Acadia Advantage, now named Acadia Advantage 2.0.
Athletics.
Acadia's sports teams are called the Axemen and Axewomen.
They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of Canadian Interuniversity Sport.
School spirit abounds with men's and women's varsity teams that have delivered more conference and national championships than any other institution in Atlantic University Sport.
Routinely, more than one-third of Acadia's varsity athletes also achieve Academic All-Canadian designation through Canadian Interuniversity Sport by maintaining a minimum average of 80 per cent.
Expansion and modernization of  <START:person> Raymond Field <END>  was completed in the fall of 2007 and features the installation of an eight-lane all-weather running track and a move to the same premium artificial turf used by the New England Patriots of the National Football League for its main playing field.
The Raymond Field modernization was a gift to the university by friends, alumni, and the province.
War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams.
In September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club and the Acadia Masters Swim Club to form the Acadia Swim Club and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14-year hiatus.
On 26 September 2008, the university announced its intention to return swimming to a varsity status in September 2009.
Fight song.
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: "Stand Up and Cheer", the Acadia University fight song.
According to 'Songs of Acadia College' (Wolfville, NS 1902-3, 1907), the songs include: 'Acadia Centennial Song' (1938); 'The Acadia Clan Song'; 'Alma Mater Acadia;' 'Alma Mater Acadia' (1938) and 'Alma Mater Song.' Symbols.
In 1974, Acadia was granted a coat of arms designed by the College of Arms in London, England.
The coat of arms is two-tone, with the school's official colours, garnet and blue, on the shield.
The axes represent the school's origins in a rural setting, and the determination of its founders who cleared the land and built the school on donated items and labour.
The open books represent the intellectual pursuits of a university, and the wolves heads are a whimsical representation of the University's location in Wolfville.
"In pulvere vinces" (In dust you conquer) is the motto.
The University seal depicts the Greek goddess of wisdom Athena in front of the first college hall.
The University also uses a stylized "A" as a logo for its sports teams.
Notable among a number of fight songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are: the Acadia University alma mater set to the tune of "Annie Lisle".
The lyrics are: Historic buildings at Acadia University.
Seminary House, also known as the Ladies' Seminary, is a Second Empire style-building constructed in 1878 as a home for women attending the university.
It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997 as Canada's oldest facility associated with the higher education of women.
Carnegie Hall, built in 1909, is a large, two-storey, Neo-classical brick building.
It was designated under the provincial Heritage Property Act in 1989 as its construction in 1909 signified Acadia's evolution from classical college to liberal university.
Student life.
At Acadia University, students have access to the Student Union Building which serves as a hub for students and houses many Student Union organizations.
The building also houses The Axe Lounge, a convenience store, an information desk and two food outlets.
The university press, The Athenaeum, is a member of CUP.
Student government.
All students are represented by the Acadia Students' Union.
The Union Executive for the 2013–2014 academic year: President  <START:person> Callie Lathem <END> , Vice President Programming  <START:person> Chelsey Spinney <END> , Vice President Academic  <START:person> Liam Murphy <END> , Vice President Finance  <START:person> Jalen Sabean <END> , Vice President Communications  <START:person> Suzanne Gray <END> .
The student newspaper is "The Athenaeum."
Residences.
Approximately 1500 students live on-campus in 12 residences:  Arthur Eddington  Sir  <START:person> Arthur Stanley Eddington <END> , OM, FRS (28 December 1882 – 22 November 1944) was a British astronomer, physicist, and mathematician of the early 20th century who did his greatest work in astrophysics.
He was also a philosopher of science and a popularizer of science.
The Eddington limit, the natural limit to the luminosity of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour.
He is famous for his work regarding the theory of relativity.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrote a number of articles that announced and explained  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's theory of general relativity to the English-speaking world.
World War I severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England.
He also conducted an expedition to observe the Solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 that provided one of the earliest confirmations of relativity, and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.
Early years.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was born 28 December 1882 in Kendal,  <START:person> Westmorland <END>  (now Cumbria), England, the son of Quaker parents,  <START:person> Arthur Henry Eddington <END>  and  <START:person> Sarah Ann Shout <END> .
His father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to  <START:person> Kendal <END>  to become headmaster of Stramongate School.
He died in the typhoid epidemic which swept England in 1884.
His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income.
The family moved to Weston-super-Mare where at first  <START:person> Stanley <END>  (as his mother and sister always called  <START:person> Eddington <END> ) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.
In 1893  <START:person> Eddington <END>  entered Brynmelyn School.
He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature.
His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the University of Manchester) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year.
He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to physics for the next three years.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers,  <START:person> Arthur Schuster <END>  and  <START:person> Horace Lamb <END> .
At Manchester,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician  <START:person> J. W. Graham <END> .
His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a B.Sc. in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.
Based on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge in 1902.
His tutor at Cambridge was  <START:person> Robert Alfred Herman <END>  and in 1904  <START:person> Eddington <END>  became the first ever second-year student to be placed as Senior Wrangler.
After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on thermionic emission in the Cavendish Laboratory.
This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students.
This hiatus was brief.
Death.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  died of cancer in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 22 November 1944.
His body was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium (Cambridgeshire) on 27 November 1944; the cremated remains were buried in the grave of his mother in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.
Astronomy.
In January 1906,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the Astronomer Royal at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.
He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month.
He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the parallax of 433 Eros on photographic plates that had started in 1900.
He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the  <START:person> Smith <END> 's Prize in 1907.
The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge.
In December 1912  <START:person> George Darwin <END> , son of  <START:person> Charles Darwin <END> , died suddenly and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was promoted to his chair as the Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in early 1913.
Later that year,  <START:person> Robert Ball <END> , holder of the theoretical  <START:person> Lowndean <END>  chair also died, and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was named the director of the entire Cambridge Observatory the next year.
In May 1914 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and won their Royal Medal in 1918 and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1926.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  also investigated the interior of stars through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes.
He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for Cepheid variables.
He began by extending  <START:person> Karl Schwarzschild <END> 's earlier work on radiation pressure in Emden polytropic models.
These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere.
He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior.
However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, density and pressure at all points inside a star, and  <START:person> Eddington <END>  argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics.
 <START:person> James Jeans <END>  contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be ionized, but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important mass-luminosity relation.
This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as ideal gases.
In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy.
Jeans and others defended the  <START:person> Kelvin <END> – <START:person> Helmholtz <END>  mechanism, which was based on classical mechanics, while  <START:person> Eddington <END>  speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.
With these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees.
In 1924, he discovered the mass-luminosity relation for stars (see Lecchini in #External links and references ).
Despite some disagreement,  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution.
The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by  <START:person> Michelson <END>  in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's intuitive, exploratory style.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as "The Internal Constitution of the Stars", which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and  <START:person> Edward Arthur Milne <END> .
An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in quantum physics, including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.
Dispute with  <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END>  on existence of black holes.
The topic of extension of his models precipitated his famous dispute with  <START:person> Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar <END> , who was then a student at Cambridge.
 <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's work presaged the discovery of black holes, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  refused to believe that  <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world.
History clearly proved  <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrong, but his motivation remains a matter of some controversy.
 <START:person> Chandrasekhar <END> 's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays  <START:person> Eddington <END>  as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist.
This is at variance with  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's character as described by other contemporaries.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain away the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.
Relativity.
During World War I,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from  <START:person> Willem de Sitter <END>  regarding  <START:person> Einstein <END> ’s theory of general relativity.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his Quaker religious beliefs, one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist.
He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain.
He and Astronomer Royal  <START:person> Frank Watson Dyson <END>  organized two expeditions to observe a solar eclipse in 1919 to make the first empirical test of  <START:person> Einstein <END> ’s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field.
In fact,  <START:person> Dyson <END> ’s argument for the indispensability of  <START:person> Eddington <END> ’s expertise in this test was what prevented  <START:person> Eddington <END>  from eventually having to enter military service.
When conscription was introduced in Britain on 2 March 1916,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  intended to apply for an exemption as a conscientious objector.
Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's work being of national interest.
In 1918, this was appealed against by the Ministry of National Service.
Before the appeal tribunal in June,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognised and would have ended his exemption in August 1918.
A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record.
Astronomer Royal, Sir  <START:person> Frank Dyson <END> , supported  <START:person> Eddington <END>  at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's essential role in the solar eclipse expedition to Principe in May 1919.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  made clear his willingness to serve in the Friends' Ambulance Unit, the Red Cross, or as a harvest labourer.
However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of  <START:person> Eddington <END>  continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Principe expedition.
The war ended before the end of his exemption.
After the war,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  travelled to the island of Príncipe near Africa to watch the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919.
During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars in the region around the Sun.
According to the theory of general relativity, stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field.
This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by  <START:person> Einstein <END> .
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's observations published the next year confirmed  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's theory, and were hailed at the time as a conclusive proof of general relativity over the Newtonian model.
The news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story.
Afterward,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations.
It has been claimed that  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's observations were of poor quality, and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at Sobral, Brazil, which appeared closer to the Newtonian model, but a 1979 re-analysis with modern measuring equipment and contemporary software validated  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's results and conclusions.
The quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations, but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers.
The rejection of the results from the Brazil expedition was due to a defect in the telescopes used which, again, was completely accepted and well-understood by contemporary astronomers.
Throughout this period,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific.
He collected many of these into the "Mathematical Theory of Relativity" in 1923, which  <START:person> Albert Einstein <END>  suggested was "the finest presentation of the subject in any language."
He was an early advocate of  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment:  <START:person> Ludwik Silberstein <END> , a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached  <START:person> Eddington <END>  at the Royal Society's (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended  <START:person> Einstein <END> 's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged  <START:person> Arthur <END>  as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory ( <START:person> Silberstein <END> , of course, was including himself and  <START:person> Einstein <END>  as the other two).
When  <START:person> Eddington <END>  refrained from replying, he insisted  <START:person> Arthur <END>  not be "so shy", whereupon  <START:person> Eddington <END>  replied, "Oh, no!
I was wondering who the third one might be!" Cosmology.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models.
He had been investigating the instability of the  <START:person> Einstein <END>  universe when he learned of both  <START:person> Lemaître <END> 's 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession on the spiral nebulae.
He felt the cosmological constant must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics.
In "The Mathematical Theory of Relativity,"  <START:person> Eddington <END>  interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is "self-gauging".
Fundamental theory and the  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number.
During the 1920s until his death, he increasingly concentrated on what he called "fundamental theory" which was intended to be a unification of quantum theory, relativity, cosmology, and gravitation.
At first he progressed along "traditional" lines, but turned increasingly to an almost numerological analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.
His basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number.
In many cases these would result in numbers close to 1040, its square, or its square root.
He was convinced that the mass of the proton and the charge of the electron were a "natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe" and that their values were not accidental.
One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics,  <START:person> Paul Dirac <END> , also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the  <START:person> Dirac <END>  large numbers hypothesis, and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.
A somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the fine structure constant, α.
At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons.
Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the degrees of freedom, so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number.
Wags at the time started calling him "Arthur Adding-one".
This change of stance detracted from  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's credibility in the physics community.
The is estimated at 1/137.035 999 074(44).
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed "E-numbers" (representing a certain group – a  <START:person> Clifford <END>  algebra).
These in effect incorporated spacetime into a higher-dimensional structure.
While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a grand unified theory.
Moreover,  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics.
In particular, he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the Universe 136 x 2256, or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons + electrons.
When equalized with the non-dark energy equivalent number of hydrogen atoms (3/10) x Rc2/GmH, this corresponds to a Universe radius R = 13.8
Giga light year, a value predicted for years from universal constants using an atomic-cosmic symmetry, and compatible with c-times the so-called Universe age 13.80(4) Gyr, as determined by the recent mission Planck (March 2003).
He did not complete this line of research before his death in 1944; his book "Fundamental Theory" was published posthumously in 1948.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  number for cycling.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  is credited with devising a measure of a cyclist's long-distance riding achievements.
The  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days.
For example an  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions.
Achieving a high  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's own E-number was 84.
The  <START:person> Eddington <END>  number for cycling is analogous to the "h"-index that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.
Philosophy.
Idealism.
Sir  <START:person> Arthur Eddington <END>  wrote in his book "The Nature of the Physical World" that "The stuff of the world is mind-stuff."
The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds...
The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it...
It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature...
It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character.
But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference." <START:person> —Eddington <END> ,
"The Nature of the Physical World", 276-81.
The idealist conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.
The first derives directly from current physical theory.
Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behavior of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics.
From this,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required.
The second, and more interesting argument, was based on  <START:person> Eddington <END> 's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts.
First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness.
We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is "mind-stuff."
Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.
But, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material.
To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world.
However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties.
But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.
 <START:person> Ian Barbour <END> , in his book Issues in Science and Religion (1966), p. 133, cites  <START:person> Arthur Eddington <END> 's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) for a text that argues The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for "the defense of the idea of human freedom" and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical idealism "the thesis that reality is basically mental".
 <START:person> Charles De Koninck <END>  points out that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase "mind-stuff" to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same "stuff" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.
As  <START:person> De Koninck <END>  quotes  <START:person> Eddington <END> , There is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it.
I will not discuss the doctrine since I have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection.
At any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon.
In the scientific world (which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing) there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer; it reflects sunlight when no one sees it; it has mass when no one is measuring the mass; it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance; and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date. <START:person> —Eddington <END> ,
"The Nature of the Physical World", 226 Indeterminism.
Against  <START:person> Albert Einstein <END>  and others who advocated determinism, indeterminism—championed by  <START:person> Eddington <END> —says that a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the epistemological limitations of physicists' understanding.
The uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, then, would not necessarily be due to hidden variables but to an indeterminism in nature itself.
Popular and philosophical writings.
 <START:person> Eddington <END>  wrote a clever parody of "The Rubaiyat of  <START:person> Omar Khayyam <END> ", recounting his 1919 solar eclipse experiment.
It contained the following quatrain:  <poem> Oh leave the Wise our measures to collate  One thing at least is certain, LIGHT has WEIGHT, One thing is certain, and the rest debate — Light-rays, when near the Sun, DO NOT GO STRAIGHT.</poem>
During the 1920s and 30s,  <START:person> Eddington <END>  gave innumerable lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity, in addition to his textbook "The Mathematical Theory of Relativity", and later, quantum mechanics.
Many of these were gathered into books, including "The Nature of the Physical World" and "New Pathways in Science".
His skillful use of literary allusions and humor helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible.
 <START:person> Eddington <END> 's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of  <START:person> Eddington <END> ’s clear and entertaining exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics.
He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum physics) provided new room for personal religious experience and free will.
Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.
He is sometimes misunderstood as having promoted the infinite monkey theorem in his 1928 book "The Nature of the Physical World", with the phrase "If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the British Museum".
It is clear from the context that  <START:person> Eddington <END>  is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration.
On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term "improbable" is functionally equivalent to "impossible".
His popular writings made him, quite literally, a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.
Adrenal gland  The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a wide variety of hormones.
They are found on the top of the kidneys and consist of a number of different layers that directly influence the structure and function of the glands.
Each gland has an outer cortex made of steroid-producing cells surrounding a core of medulla, formed by chromaffin cells in direct relationship with the sympathetic nervous system.
The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones according to their functions and microscopic appearance.
The adrenal cortex produces a class of steroid hormones, the corticosteroids, which are classified according to their effects.
Mineralocorticoids, produced in the zona glomerulosa, help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance.
Glucocorticoids such as cortisol, are synthesized in the zona fasciculata and their functions include regulation of glycogen and lipid metabolism and immune system suppression.
The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis produces androgens (steroid hormones) that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs.
The production of steroid hormones is named steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells.
The medulla produces the catecholamines, epinephrine, and norepinephrine which function to provoke a quick response on diverse organs in stress situations.
Regulation of synthesis and secretion of adrenal hormones is equally varied.
Mineralocorticoid production is mainly under influence of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, in which specialized juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys monitor blood volume and start a cascade of reactions that leads to the stimulation of aldosterone synthesis in the zona glomerulosa.
Cortisol and androgen synthesis are under control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a classic example of a negative feedback loop, in which the hypothalamus and pituitary gland release stimulating hormones whenever cortisol levels are low.
In contrast, release of medullary catecholamines is regulated by direct innervation from the sympathetic nervous system.
There are a number of endocrine diseases and disorders that can affect the normal functioning of the adrenal gland.
Overproduction of corticosteroid hormones leads to  <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome, whereas insufficiency is commonly associated with  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by a disregulation of endocrine control mechanisms.
A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue, and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.
Structure.
The adrenal glands are located bilaterally in the retroperitoneum superior and slightly medial to the kidneys.
In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left adrenal gland is semilunar in shape; in non-humans, they are quadrilateral in shape.
The combined weight of the adrenal glands in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10 grams.
The adrenal glands are surrounded by an adipose capsule and are enclosed within the renal fascia, a fibrous structure that also surrounds the kidney.
A weak septum of connective tissue separates the glands from the kidneys and facilitates surgical removal of the kidneys without damage to the glands.
The adrenal glands are in close relationship with the diaphragm, and are attached to the crura of the diaphragm by means of the renal fascia.
Each adrenal gland has two anatomically and functionally distinct parts, the outer adrenal cortex and the inner medulla, both of which produce hormones.
The cortex mainly produces aldosterone, cortisol and androgens, while the medulla produces adrenaline and noradrenaline.
Cortex.
The adrenal cortex is devoted to production of corticosteroid and androgen hormones.
Specific cortical cells produce particular hormones including aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens such as androstenedione.
Under normal unstressed conditions, the human adrenal glands produce the equivalent of 35–40 mg of cortisone acetate per day.
The adrenal cortex comprises three zones, or layers.
This "anatomic zonation" can be appreciated at the microscopic level, where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics.
The adrenal cortex exhibits "functional zonation" as well: by virtue of the characteristic enzymes present in each zone, the zones produce and secrete distinct hormones.
Zona glomerulosa.
The outermost layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona glomerulosa, lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland.
Cells in this layer form ovoid groups, separated by trabeculae of connective tissue that are continuous with the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.
This layer is the main site for production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, by the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase.
Aldosterone is a hormone largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure.
The expression of neuron-specific proteins in the zona glomerulosa cells of human adrenocortical tissues has been predicted and reported by several authors and it was suggested that the expression of proteins like the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the cells of the zona glomerulosa reflects the regenerative feature of these cells, which would lose NCAM immunoreactivity after moving to the zona fasciculata.
However, together with other data on neuroendocrine properties of zona glomerulosa cells, NCAM expression may reflect a neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells.
Voltage-dependent calcium channels have been detected in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, which suggests that calcium-channel blockers may directly influence the adrenocortical biosynthesis of aldosterone in vivo.
Zona fasciculata.
Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the zona fasciculata is responsible for producing mainly glucocorticoids such as cortisol.
It is the widest of the three layers as it composes nearly 80% of the cortical volume.
The cells, arranged in columns radially oriented towards the medulla, have numerous lipid droplets responsible of the pale staining nature of the cytoplasm.
Abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum are also present in the cells of this layer.
Zona reticularis.
The innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly next to the medulla.
It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans.
Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue.
The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.
Medulla.
The adrenal medulla is the core of the adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex.
The chromaffin cells of the medulla (named for their characteristic brown staining with chromic acid salts) are the body's main source of the circulating catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla.
Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted.
To carry out its part of this response, the adrenal medulla receives input from the sympathetic nervous system through preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord from T5–T11.
Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion.
Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.
Blood supply.
Although variations of the blood supply to the adrenal glands (and kidneys) are common, there are usually three arteries that supply each adrenal gland: Venous drainage of the adrenal glands is achieved via the suprarenal veins: The central adrenomedullary vein is a particular type of blood vessel in the adrenal medulla.
Its structure is different from the other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.
The suprarenal vein exits the adrenal gland through a depression on its anterior surface known as the hilum.
Note that the arteries supplying the suprarenal gland do not pass through the hilum.
The suprarenal veins may form anastomoses with the inferior phrenic veins.
Since the right supra-renal vein is short and drains directly into the inferior vena cava it is likely to injure the latter during removal of right adrenal for various reasons.
The adrenal glands (alongside the thyroid gland) have one of the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue of any organ.
Up to 60 arterioles may enter each adrenal gland.
This may be one of the reasons that lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the adrenals.
Function.
The adrenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other parts of the body.
These hormones are involved in a number of different pathways.
Corticosteroid production.
All corticosteroid hormones share cholesterol as a common precursor.
In consequence, the first step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis.
Cells that produce steroid hormones provide themselves with cholesterol in various ways.
Their main source is dietary cholesterol transported in the blood as LDL, which enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, although endogenous synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum is sufficient when LDL levels are abnormally low as represented in people with abetalipoproteinemia (a genetic disorder of intestinal lipid absorption).
In lysosomes, cholesterol is separated from the proteic component of LDL and then stored within cell membranes or bound with proteins.
The initial part of conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones involves a number of enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that are located in the inner membrane of mitochondria.
Transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane is facilitated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and is the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis.
The functional zonation of the adrenal cortex is determined by the presence of distinct enzymes in each particular layer, explaining how the different layers produce unique hormones from a common precursor.
The first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase.
After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it.
Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs).
Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones.
Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases.
For example, the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.
Regulation of corticosteroid production.
Glucocorticoids are under the regulatory influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone of the anterior pituitary.
In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated by the presence of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus.
ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes.
The HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis.
The HPA-axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.
Mineralocorticoid secretion is regulated mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), the concentration of potassium, and ACTH to a lesser extent.
Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II.
Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.
Catecholamine production.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines, water-soluble compounds that have a structure made of a catechol group and an amino group.
The adrenal glands are responsible for the majority of circulating epinephrine (adrenaline) in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating norepinephrine (noradrenaline).
These hormones are released in the adrenal medulla, which is richly vascular.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.
Catecholamines are produced in chromaffin cells (the main type of cells in the adrenal medulla) from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver.
The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in the first step of catecholamine synthesis.
L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into norepinephrine.
In the cytosol, norepinephrine is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules.
Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.
The adrenal medulla is innervated by splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system, which signal the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.
Effects of adrenal hormones.
Mineralocorticoids.
Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid produced in the body.
Its effects are on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct).
Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates.
Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation.
Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium (Ca2+) entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry.
However, mouse zona glomerulosa cells within adrenal slices spontaneously generate membrane potential oscillations of low periodicity; this innate electrical excitability of zona glomerulosa cells provides a platform for the production of a recurrent Ca2+ channels signal that can be controlled by angiotensin II and extracellular potassium, the two major regulators of aldosterone production.[30]
Angiotensin II originates from plasmatic angiotensin I after the conversion of angiotensinogen by renin produced by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney.[
Glucocorticoids.
Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid produced under normal conditions and its actions include mobilization of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, but it does not increase under starvation conditions.
Additionally, cortisol enhances the activity of other hormones including glucagon and catecholamines.
The zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary.
Adrenal androgens.
Cells in zona reticularis of the adrenal glands produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most important of which is DHEA.
In general, these hormones do not have an overall effect in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines that act at adrenergic receptors throughout the body, with effects including constriction of small arteries, dilation of veins, and an increase in the heartrate.
Adrenergic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors.
This means that they interact with G proteins, a family of enzymes that start a chain of reactions leading to the formation of intracellular second messengers.
There are many classes of adrenergic receptors, and the specific response in the cell upon binding of either epinephrine or norepinephrine depends on the mechanism of action of those receptors.
For example, when epinephrine or norepinephrine bind to β-adrenergic receptors, the level of cAMP (a second messenger) rises inside the cell, but if they bind to α2-adrenergic receptors in other tissues, the level of cAMP lowers.
Development.
The adrenal glands are composed of two heterogenous types of tissue: in the center there is the adrenal medulla, which produces and releases mostly adrenaline to the blood in stress situations as part of the sympathetic nervous system.
Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a wide variety of steroid hormones.
These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal developments.
Cortex.
Adrenal cortex tissue is derived from the intermediate mesoderm.
It first appears 33 days after fertilisation, shows steroidogenic (steroid hormone production) capabilities by the eighth week and undergoes rapid growth during the first trimester of pregnancy.
The fetal adrenal cortex is different from its adult counterpart, as it is composed of two distinct zones: the inner fetal zone, which carries most of the hormone-producing activity, and the outer definitive zone, which is in a proliferative phase.
The fetal zone produces large amounts of adrenal androgens (male sex hormones) that are used by the placenta for estrogen biosynthesis.
Cortical development of the adrenal gland is regulated mostly by ACTH, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates cortisol synthesis.
During midgestation, the fetal zone occupies most of the cortical volume and produces 100–200 mg/day of DHEA-S, an androgen and precursor of both androgens and estrogens (female sex hormones).
Adrenal hormones, especially glucocorticoids such as cortisol are considered essential for prenatal development of organs, particularly for the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The adrenal gland decreases in size after birth because of the rapid disappearance of the fetal zone, with a decrease in androgen secretion.
Adrenarche.
During childhood, androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but several years before puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of DHEA and DHEA-S.
These changes are part of a process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates.
Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex.
Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.
Medulla.
The adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which come from the ectoderm layer of the embryo.
These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs.
These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system.
Cells of the adrenal medulla are also called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs.
Glucocorticoid production by the adrenal cortex was thought to be responsible for this differentiation, but now the available data suggest that BMP-4 secreted in the adrenal tissue is the primary responsible for the differentiation, and that glucocorticoids have a role in the posterior development of the cells.
Clinical significance.
Corticosteroid overproduction.
 <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome.
 <START:person> Cushing <END> 's syndrome is the manifestation of glucocorticoid excess.
It can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol.
Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent.
The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH.
The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.
Primary aldosteronism.
When the zona glomerulosa produces excess aldosterone, the result is primary aldosteronism.
Causes for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia of the glands and aldosterone-producing adenomas, which is called Conn's syndrome.
Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, increasing potassium depletion and sodium retention.
Adrenal insufficiency.
 <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
 <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease refers to primary hypoadrenalism, which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid production.
In the Western world,  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease is more commonly autoimmune, where the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex.
Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis.
A distinctive feature of  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.
An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and an array of nonspecific symptoms such as vomiting and fever.
An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma.
Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency.
Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when a part of the body is affected by a condition that impairs the production of hormones in the adrenal cortex.
The most common cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is a pituitary adenoma, which may affect the ability of the pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
This hormone is vital in the event of physiological stress, as it stimulates the adrenal glands into action: if absent, this action will not occur and an Addisonian crisis may follow unless an emergency hydrocortisone injection is given.
Tertiary adrenal insufficiency results from a deficiency in the production of CRH (produced by the hypothalamus).
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a congenital disease in which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis.
In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis.
As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other corticosteroids instead.
The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens.
Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.
Adrenal tumors.
Adrenal tumors are commonly found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging.
They are seen in around 3.4% of CT scans, and in most cases they are benign adenomas.
Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.
Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that arise from chromaffin cells.
They can produce a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety and palpitations.
Common signs include hypertension and tachycardia.
Surgery, especially adrenal laparoscopy, is the most common treatment for small pheochromocytomas.
History.
 <START:person> Bartolomeo Eustachi <END> , an Italian anatomist, is credited with the first description of the adrenal glands in 1564.
One of the most recognized works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 with the publication of "On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule", by the English physician  <START:person> Thomas Addison <END> .
In his monography,  <START:person> Addison <END>  described what the French physician  <START:person> George Trousseau <END>  would later name  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations.
In 1894, English physiologists  <START:person> George Oliver <END>  and  <START:person> Edward Schafer <END>  studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects.
In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts form the adrenal cortex to treat  <START:person> Addison <END> 's disease.
 <START:person> Edward Calvin Kendall <END> ,  <START:person> Philip Hench <END>  and  <START:person> Tadeusz Reichstein <END>  were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the isolation of cortisone from the adrenal cortex.
Etymology.
The adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys.
The term "adrenal" comes from "ad-" (Latin, "near") and "renes" (Latin, "kidney").
Similarly, "suprarenal" is derived from "supra-" (Latin, "above") and "renes".
 <START:person> Alfonso Leng  Alfonso Leng Haygus <END>  (11 February 1884 – 11 November 1974) was a post-romantic composer of classical music.
He was born in Santiago, Chile.
He wrote the first important symphonic work in Chilean tradition, "La Muerte de Alcino", a symphonic poem inspired by the novel of  <START:person> Pedro Prado <END> .
He composed many art songs in different languages and important piano pieces, like the five "Doloras" (1914), which he later orchestrated and are normally played in concerts in Chile and Latin America.
He won the Nacional Art Prize in 1957.
 <START:person> Leng <END>  was also an accomplished dentist in Santiago.
As a dentist, he was the main founder of the dentistry faculty of the Universidad de Chile, and he was eventually elected as the first dean.
 <START:person> Leng <END>  was the nephew of composer  <START:person> Carmela Mackenna <END> .
AD (disambiguation)  An ad (advertisement) is a form of marketing communication.
AD ("Anno Domini") is a designation used to label years following 1 BC in the  <START:person> Julian <END>  and Gregorian calendars.
AD, A.D. or Ad may also refer to: People.
People nicknamed "AD" or "A.D." include: "Ad" can also refer to:  Adamic language  The Adamic language is, according to Jews (as recorded in the "midrashim") and some Christians, the language spoken by  <START:person> Adam <END>  (and possibly Eve) in the Garden of Eden.
It is variously interpreted as either the language used by God to address  <START:person> Adam <END>  (the divine language), or the language invented by  <START:person> Adam <END>  with which he named all things (including Eve), as in .
Medieval.
Traditional Jewish exegesis such as Midrash ( <START:person> Genesis Rabbah <END>  38) says that  <START:person> Adam <END>  spoke Hebrew because the names he gives Eve – ""Isha" (Book of Genesis 2:23) and "Chava"" (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew.
By contrast,  <START:person> Kabbalism <END>  assumed an "eternal Torah" which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew.
Thus,  <START:person> Abulafia <END>  in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in Paradise had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.
Eco (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of  <START:person> Adam <END>  was preserved by  <START:person> Adam <END> 's descendants until the confusion of tongues (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).
 <START:person> Dante <END>  addresses the topic in his "De Vulgari Eloquentia".
He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.
He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to  <START:person> Eve <END> , addressing the serpent, and not to  <START:person> Adam <END> .
In his "Divina Commedia", however,  <START:person> Dante <END>  changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise.
 <START:person> Dante <END>  concludes ("Paradiso" XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, "El", must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which  <START:person> Dante <END>  gives as "I".
Early Modern.
Elizabethan scholar  <START:person> John Dee <END>  makes references to an occult or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of spirit medium  <START:person> Edward Kelley <END> .
 <START:person> Dee <END> 's journals did not describe the language as "Enochian", instead preferring "Angelical", the "Celestial Speech", the "Language of Angels", the "First Language of God-Christ", the "Holy Language", or "Adamical" because, according to  <START:person> Dee <END> 's Angels, it was used by  <START:person> Adam <END>  in Paradise to name all things.
The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to  <START:person> Dee <END> 's assertion that the Biblical Patriarch  <START:person> Enoch <END>  had been the last human (before  <START:person> Dee <END>  and  <START:person> Kelley <END> ) to know the language.
Modern.
Latter Day Saint movement.
 <START:person> Joseph Smith <END> , founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, in his revision of the Bible, declared the Adamic language to have been "pure and undefiled".
Some Latter Day Saints believe it to be the language of God.
Glossolalia, or speaking in tongues, was commonplace in the early years of the LDS Church, and it was commonly believed that the incomprehensible language spoken during these incidents was the language of  <START:person> Adam <END>  though this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted.
Some other early Latter Day Saint leaders, including Brigham Young,  <START:person> Orson Pratt <END> , and  <START:person> Elizabeth Ann Whitney <END> , claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language by revelation.
Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the "pure language" spoken of by  <START:person> Zephaniah <END>  and that it will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world.
Apostle  <START:person> Orson Pratt <END>  declared that "Ahman", part of the name of the settlement "Adam-ondi-Ahman" in Daviess County, Missouri, was the name of God in the Adamic language.
An 1832 handwritten page from the  <START:person> Joseph Smith <END>  Papers, titled "A Sample of the Pure Language", and reportedly dictated by  <START:person> Smith <END>  to "Br.
 <START:person> Johnson <END> ", asserts that the name of God is "Awmen".
The Latter Day Saint endowment prayer circle once included use of the words "Pay Lay Ale".
These untranslated words are no longer used in temple ordinances and have been replaced by an English version, "O God, hear the words of my mouth".
Some believe that the "Pay Lay Ale" sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase "pe le-El", פה לאל "mouth to God".
Other words thought by some Latter Day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include "deseret" ("honey bee"), see Ether and "Ahman" ("God") see Doctrine and Covenants  The Book of Moses refers to "a book of remembrance" written in the language of  <START:person> Adam <END> .
 <START:person> Avery Hopwood  James Avery Hopwood <END>  (May 28, 1882 July 1, 1928), was an American playwright, called the most successful playwright of the Jazz Age, having four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920.
Biography.
He was born in Cleveland, Ohio and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Michigan (1905).
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, "Clothes" (1906), produced on Broadway.
He became known as "The Playboy Playwright" and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué at the time.
One play, "The Demi-Virgin" in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, "Stripping Cupid", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie.
The case was dismissed.
Dramatist.
His many plays included "Nobody's Widow" (1910), starring  <START:person> Blanche Bates <END> ; "Fair and Warmer" (1915), starring  <START:person> Madge Kennedy <END>  (filmed in 1919); "The Gold Diggers" (1919), starring  <START:person> Ina Claire <END>  (filmed in 1923 as "The Gold Diggers", in 1928 as "Gold Diggers of Broadway" and also as "Gold Diggers of 1933"); "Ladies' Night", 1920, starring  <START:person> Charlie Ruggles <END>  (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play "The Bat" (with  <START:person> Mary Roberts Rinehart <END> ), 1920 (filmed in 1926 "The Bat", 1930 "The Bat Whispers," and 1959 "The Bat)"; "Getting  <START:person> Gertie <END> 's Garter" (with  <START:person> Wilson Collison <END> ), 1921, starring  <START:person> Hazel Dawn <END>  (filmed in 1927 and 1945); "The Demi-Virgin", 1921, also starring  <START:person> Dawn <END> ; "The Alarm Clock", 1923; "The Best People" (with  <START:person> David Gray <END> ), 1924 (filmed in 1925 and as "Fast and Loose" in 1930), the song-farce "Naughty Cinderella", 1925, starring  <START:person> Irene Bordoni <END>  and "The Garden of Eden" in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as "The Garden of Eden").
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  was asked to write the third act of  <START:person> Mary Roberts Rinehart <END> 's play; "The Bat".
 <START:person> Hopwood <END>  collaborated with  <START:person> Rinehart <END>  to then work on the last act of the play in Sewickley and sometimes in New York.
Interestingly, the early sound film, "The Bat Whispers", played an influence on  <START:person> Bob Kane <END> 's  <START:person> Batman <END>  because the inspiration for  <START:person> Batman <END> 's costume came from the "mysterious Bat" character portrayed in the movie from 1930.
A clever, adroit, masterful craftsman who wrote to the tastes of his public,  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  was inexhaustible in his work ethic.
Although the press reported that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer  <START:person> Rose Rolanda <END>  in 1924,  <START:person> Hopwood <END> 's close friend  <START:person> Carl Van Vechten <END>  confirmed in later years that it was all a publicity stunt.
 <START:person> Rolanda <END>  would later marry caricaturist  <START:person> Miguel Covarrubias <END> .
Death.
While swimming at Juan-les-Pins on the French Riviera, July 1, 1928, he suffered a heart attack and died.
He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio, next to his mother,  <START:person> Jule <END> .
Hopwood Awards.
The terms of  <START:person> Hopwood <END> 's will left a substantial portion of his estate to his alma mater, the University of Michigan for the establishment of the  <START:person> Avery Hopwood <END>  and Jule Hopwood Creative Writing Awards.
The bequest stipulated: "It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged."
Famous  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  award winners include  <START:person> Robert Hayden <END> ,  <START:person> Marge Piercy <END> ,  <START:person> Arthur Miller <END> ,  <START:person> Betty Smith <END> ,  <START:person> Lawrence Kasdan <END> ,  <START:person> John Ciardi <END> ,  <START:person> Mary Gaitskill <END> ,  <START:person> Edmund White <END> ,  <START:person> Nancy Willard <END> ,  <START:person> Frank O’Hara <END> , and  <START:person> Steve Hamilton <END> .
Works.
"The Great Bordello".
Throughout his life,  <START:person> Hopwood <END>  worked on a novel that he hoped would "expose" the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published.
 <START:person> Jack Sharrar <END>  recovered the manuscript for this novel in 1982 during his research for " <START:person> Avery Hopwood <END> , His Life and Plays".
The novel was published in July 2011 as "The Great Bordello".
Adventism  Adventism is a branch of Protestantism which began in the 19th century in the context of the Second Great Awakening revival in the United States.
The name refers to belief in the imminent Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END> .
 <START:person> William Miller <END>  started the Adventist movement in the 1830s.
His followers became known as Millerites.
Although the Adventist churches hold much in common, their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of refers to the one in heaven or one on earth.
The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible, leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath.
The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs (1980 and 2005), which use Biblical references as justification.
In 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches.
The largest church within the movement — the Seventh-day Adventist Church — has more than 18 million members.
History.
Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement.
Its most vocal leader was  <START:person> William Miller <END> .
Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported  <START:person> Miller <END> 's predictions of  <START:person> Christ <END> 's return.
After the "Great Disappointment" of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.
Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (second coming of  <START:person> Jesus <END> ).
Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that  <START:person> Jesus <END>  had come not literally but "spiritually", and consequently were known as "spiritualizers".
A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted.
This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.
Albany Conference (1845).
The Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement.
Following this meeting, the "Millerites" then became known as "Adventists" or "Second Adventists".
However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.
Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the Advent Christian Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
The largest group was organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church.
Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death.
They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies.
It has diminished to almost non-existence today.
Their main publication was the "Advent Herald", of which  <START:person> Sylvester Bliss <END>  was the editor until his death in 1863.
It was later called the "Messiah’s Herald".
The Life and Advent Union was founded by  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  in 1863.
He had established "The Bible Examiner" in 1842.
It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964.
The Advent Christian Church officially formed in 1861, and grew rapidly at first.
It declined a little during the 20th century.
The Advent Christians publish the four magazines "The Advent Christian Witness", "Advent Christian News", "Advent Christian Missions" and "Maranatha".
They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a one-year Bible College in Lenox, Massachusetts called Berkshire Institute for Christian Studies.
The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church officially formed in 1863.
It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.
It published the "Adventist Review, Kids Review, and Sabbath Herald".
It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.
 <START:person> Miller <END>  did not join any of the movements, and he spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.
Denominations.
The "Handbook of Denominations in the United States", 12th edn., describes the following churches as "Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches": Christadelphians.
The Christadelphians were founded in 1844 by  <START:person> John Thomas <END>  and had an estimated 25,000 members in 170 ecclesias, or churches, in 2000 in America.
Advent Christian Church.
The Advent Christian Church was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America.
It is a "first-day" body of Adventist Christians founded on the teachings of  <START:person> William Miller <END> .
It adopted the "conditional immortality" views of  <START:person> Charles F. Hudson <END>  and  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  who formed the "Advent Christian Association" in Salem, Massachusetts in 1860.
Primitive Advent Christian Church.
The Primitive Advent Christian Church is a small group which separated from the Advent Christian Church.
It differs from the parent body mainly on two points.
Its members observe foot washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized).
This is sometimes referred to as rebaptism.
Seventh-day Adventist.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, founded in 1863, had over 17,210,000 baptized members (not counting children of members) worldwide as of 2011.
It is best known for its teaching that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the Sabbath and is the appropriate day for worship.
However, it is the second coming of  <START:person> Jesus Christ <END>  along with the Judgement day, based on the three angels message in Revelation 14: 6-13, that is the main doctrine of SDA.
Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement.
The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members from the Seventh-day Adventist Church caused by disagreement over military service on the Sabbath day during World War I. Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association.
The Davidians (originally named  <START:person> Shepherd <END> 's Rod) is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members made up primarily of voluntarily disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
They were originally known as the Shepherd's Rod and are still sometimes referred to as such.
The group derives its name from two books on Bible doctrine written by its founder,  <START:person> Victor Houteff <END> , in 1929.
Branch Davidians.
The Branch Davidians were a split ("branch") from the Davidians.
Many of them were killed during the infamous Waco Siege of April 1993.
Church of God (Seventh Day).
The Church of God (Seventh-Day) was founded in 1863 and it had an estimated 11,000 members in 185 churches in 1999 in America.
Its founding members separated in 1858 from those Adventists associated with  <START:person> Ellen G. White <END>  who later organized themselves as Seventh-day Adventists in 1863.
The Church of God (Seventh Day) split in 1933, creating two bodies: one headquartered in Salem, West Virginia, and known as the Church of God (7th day) Salem Conference and the other one headquartered in Denver, Colorado and known as the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day).
The Worldwide Church of God splintered from this.
Church of God and Saints of  <START:person> Christ <END> .
The Church of God and Saints of  <START:person> Christ <END>  was founded in 1896 and had an estimated 40,000 members in approximately 200 congregations in 1999 in America.
Church of God General Conference.
Many denominations known as "Church of God" have Adventist origins.
The Church of God General Conference was founded in 1921 and had 7,634 members in 162 churches in 2004 in America.
It is an Adventist Christian body which is also known as the "Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith" and the "Church of God General Conference ( <START:person> Morrow <END> , GA)".
Creation Seventh-Day Adventist.
Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church United Seventh-Day Brethren.
The United Seventh-Day Brethren is a small Sabbatarian Adventist body.
In 1947, several individuals and two independent congregations within the Church of God Adventist movement formed the "United Seventh-Day Brethren", seeking to increase fellowship and to combine their efforts in evangelism, publications, and other .
Other relationships.
The Bible Students movement founded by  <START:person> Charles Taze Russell <END>  had in its early development close connections with the Millerite movement and stalwarts of the Adventist faith, including  <START:person> George Storrs <END>  and  <START:person> Joseph Seiss <END> .
The various groupings of Bible Students currently have a cumulative membership of less than 20,000 worldwide.
Although  <START:person> Jehovah <END> 's Witnesses and Bible Students do not categorize themselves as part of the Millerite Adventist movement (or other denominations, in general), some theologians do categorize the group and schisms as Millerite Adventist because of its teachings regarding an imminent Second Coming and use of specific dates.
As of January 2014 there are approximately 8 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.
High Sabbath Adventists are a group of Seventh-day Adventists who believe in the prophetic significance of the High Sabbaths.
They are Historic Adventists who believe that God has been giving the light of the fourth angel (of Revelation 18) in the form of the Orion Message since 2010.

General:  American Football League  The American Football League (AFL) was a major professional American football league that operated from 1960 until 1969, when it merged with the National Football League (NFL).
The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence.
The AFL was created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises.
The AFL's original lineup saw an Eastern division of the New York Titans, Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers along with a Western division of the Los Angeles Chargers, Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders, and Dallas Texans.
The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960, including Houston's successful signing of All-American  <START:person> Billy Cannon <END> .
While the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance, the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with ABC (followed by a contract with NBC for games starting with the 1965 season) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide.
Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, as well as successful franchise shifts to San Diego (from LA) and Kansas City (from Dallas), the AFL established a dedicated following.
The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league's reputation among the major media.
As fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues, especially after a series of "raids," the leagues agreed to a merger in 1966.
Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions, which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl.
The AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game.
During this time the AFL added the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals.
After losses by Kansas City and Oakland in the first two AFL-NFL Championship Games to the Green Bay Packers, the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowls III and IV, cementing the league's claim to being an equal to the NFL.
In 1970, the AFL was absorbed into the NFL, and the ten AFL franchises along with the Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers became the American Football Conference.
League history.
During the 1950s, the National Football League had grown to rival Major League Baseball as one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States.
One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the Chicago Cardinals, owned by the  <START:person> Bidwill <END>  family, who had become overshadowed by the more popular Chicago Bears.
The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to St. Louis but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee.
Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END> , son and heir of Texas millionaire oilman  <START:person> H. L. Hunt <END> .
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to Dallas, Texas, where he had grown up.
However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a previous NFL franchise had failed in 1952.
While Hunt negotiated with Bidwills, similar offers were made by  <START:person> Bud Adams <END> ,  <START:person> Bob Howsam <END> , and  <START:person> Max Winter <END> .
When  <START:person> Hunt <END> ,  <START:person> Adams <END> , and  <START:person> Howsam <END>  were unable to secure a controlling interest in the Chicago Cardinals, they approached NFL commissioner  <START:person> Bert Bell <END>  and proposed the addition of expansion teams.
Bell, wary of expanding the 12-team league and risking its newfound success, rejected the offer.
On his return flight to Dallas,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  conceived the idea of an entirely new league and decided to contact the others who had shown interest in purchasing the Cardinals.
He contacted  <START:person> Adams <END> ,  <START:person> Howsam <END> , and Winter (as well as Winter's business partner,  <START:person> Bill Boyer <END> ) to gauge their interest in starting a new league.
 <START:person> Hunt <END> 's first meeting with  <START:person> Adams <END>  was held in March 1959.
Hunt, who felt a regional rivalry would be critical for the success of the new league, convinced  <START:person> Adams <END>  to join and found his team in Houston.
Hunt next secured an agreement from  <START:person> Howsam <END>  to bring a team to Denver, Colorado.
After Winter and  <START:person> Boyer <END>  agreed to start a team in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, the new league had its first four teams.
Hunt then approached  <START:person> Willard Rhodes <END> , who hoped to bring pro football to Seattle, Washington.
However, the University of Washington was unwilling to let the fledgling league use Husky Stadium, probably due to the excessive wear and tear that would have caused to the facility's grass surface.
With no place for his team to play,  <START:person> Rhodes <END> ' effort came to nothing.
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  also sought franchises in Los Angeles, California; Buffalo and New York City.
During the summer of 1959 he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a potentially costly rivalry.
Within weeks of the July 1959 announcement of the league's formation,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  received commitments from Barron Hilton and  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END>  to bring teams to Los Angeles and New York, respectively.
His initial efforts for Buffalo, However, were rebuffed, when  <START:person> Hunt <END> 's first choice of owner,  <START:person> Pat McGroder <END> , declined to take part;  <START:person> McGroder <END>  had hoped that the threat of the AFL would be enough to prompt the NFL to expand to Buffalo.
On August 14, 1959, the first league meeting was held in Chicago, Illinois, and charter memberships were given to Dallas, New York, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, and  <START:person> Minneapolis-Saint Paul <END> .
On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League.
The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier All-America Football Conference (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league.
AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones.
Only the party from Minneapolis accepted, and the Minnesota group joined the NFL the next year in 1961; the Minneapolis group joined Ole Haugsrud in the new NFL team's ownership group, with Haugsrud dubbing the team the Minnesota Vikings.
The older league also announced on August 29 that it had conveniently reversed its position against expansion, and planned to bring NFL expansion teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961.
(The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team – the Dallas Cowboys – actually started play in 1960, and the  <START:person> Vikings <END>  began play in 1961.)
Finally, the NFL quickly came to terms with the Bidwills and allowed them to relocate the struggling Cardinals to St. Louis, eliminating that city as a potential AFL market.
 <START:person> Ralph Wilson <END> , who owned a minority interest in the NFL's Detroit Lions at the time, initially announced he was placing a team in Miami, Florida, but like the Seattle situation, was also rebuffed by local ownership; given five other choices,  <START:person> Wilson <END>  negotiated with  <START:person> McGroder <END>  and brought the team that would become the Bills to Buffalo.
Buffalo was officially awarded its franchise on October 28.
During a league meeting on November 22, a 10-man ownership group from Boston, Massachusetts (led by  <START:person> Billy Sullivan <END> ) was awarded the AFL's eighth team.
On November 30, 1959,  <START:person> Joe Foss <END> , a World War II Marine fighter ace and former governor of South Dakota, was named the AFL's first commissioner.
 <START:person> Foss <END>  commissioned a friend of  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END> 's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo.
 <START:person> Hunt <END>  was elected President of the AFL on January 26, 1960.
The AFL Draft.
The AFL's first draft took place the same day Boston was awarded its franchise, and lasted 33 rounds.
The league held a second draft on December 2, which lasted for 20 rounds.
Because the Raiders joined after the AFL draft, they inherited Minnesota's selections.
A special "allocation draft" was held in January 1960, to allow the Raiders to stock their team, as some of the other AFL teams had already signed some of Minneapolis' original draft choices.
Crisis and success (1960–61).
In November 1959, Minneapolis owner  <START:person> Max Winter <END>  announced his intent to leave the AFL to accept a franchise offer from the NFL.
In 1961, his team began play in the NFL as the Minnesota Vikings.
Los Angeles Chargers owner  <START:person> Barron Hilton <END>  demanded that a replacement for Minnesota be placed in California, to reduce his team's operating costs and to create a rivalry.
After a brief search, Oakland was chosen and an ownership group led by F. Wayne Valley and local real estate developer  <START:person> Chet Soda <END>  was formed.
After initially being called the Oakland "Señores", the Oakland Raiders officially joined the AFL on January 30, 1960.
The AFL's first major success came when the Houston Oilers signed  <START:person> Billy Cannon <END> , the All-American and 1959 Heisman Trophy winner from LSU.  <START:person> Cannon <END>  signed a $100,000 contract to play for the Oilers, despite having already signed a $50,000 contract with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams.
The Oilers filed suit and claimed that Rams general manager  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  had unduly manipulated Cannon.
The court upheld the Houston contract, and with Cannon the Oilers appeared in the AFL's first three championship games (winning two).
On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with ABC, which brought in revenues of approximately $2,125,000 per year for the entire league.
On June 17, the AFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, which was dismissed in 1962 after a two-month trial.
The AFL began regular-season play (a night game on Friday, September 9, 1960) with eight teams in the league — the Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Dallas Texans, Denver Broncos, Houston Oilers, Los Angeles Chargers, New York Titans, and Oakland Raiders.
Raiders' co-owner  <START:person> Wayne Valley <END>  dubbed the AFL ownership "The Foolish Club," a term  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  subsequently used on team photographs he sent as Christmas gifts.
The Oilers became the first-ever league champions by defeating the Chargers, 24–16, in the AFL Championship on January 1, 1961.
Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable for a new league, but not nearly that of the NFL.
Whereas the more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures in excess of 50,000 per game, AFL attendance generally hovered between 10,000-20,000 per game.
With the low attendance came financial losses.
The Raiders, for instance, lost $500,000 in their first year and only survived after receiving a $400,000 loan from Bills owner  <START:person> Ralph Wilson <END> .
In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation.
In fact, the only major change was the relocation of the Chargers from Los Angeles to nearby San Diego.
On August 8, 1961, the AFL challenged the Canadian Football League to an exhibition game that would feature the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the Buffalo Bills.
Playing at Civic Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario, the Ticats defeated the Bills 38–21 playing a mix of AFL and CFL rules.
Movement and instability (1962–63).
While the Oilers found instant success in the AFL, other teams did not fare as well.
The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans struggled on and off the field during their first few seasons in the league.
Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses their first season.
Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the team playing in the San Francisco Bay Area—which already had an established NFL team (the San Francisco 49ers)—but the product on the field was also to blame.
After winning six games their debut season, the Raiders won a total of three times in the 1961 and 1962 seasons.
Oakland took part in a 1961 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did little good.
They participated in another such draft in 1962.
The Titans fared a little better on the field but had their own financial troubles.
Attendance was so low for home games that team owner  <START:person> Harry Wismer <END>  had fans move to seats closer to the field to give the illusion of a fuller stadium on television.
Eventually  <START:person> Wismer <END>  could no longer afford to meet his payroll, and on November 8, 1962 the AFL took over operations of the team.
The Titans were sold to a five-person ownership group headed by  <START:person> Sonny Werblin <END>  on March 28, 1963, and in April the new owners changed the team's name to the New York Jets.
The Raiders and Titans both finished last in their respective divisions in the 1962 season.
The Texans and Oilers, winners of their divisions, faced each other for the 1962 AFL Championship on December 23.
The Texans dethroned the two-time champion Oilers, 20–17, in a double-overtime contest that was, at the time, professional football's longest-ever game.
In 1963, the Texans became the second AFL team to relocate.
 <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  felt that despite winning the league championship in 1962, the Texans could not succeed financially competing in the same market as the Dallas Cowboys, which entered the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1960.
After meetings with New Orleans, Atlanta, and Miami,  <START:person> Hunt <END>  announced on May 22 that the Texans' new home would be Kansas City, Missouri.
Kansas City mayor  <START:person> Harold Roe Bartle <END>  (nicknamed "Chief") was instrumental in his city's success in attracting the team.
Partly to honor  <START:person> Bartle <END> , the franchise officially became the Kansas City Chiefs on May 26.
The San Diego Chargers, under head coach  <START:person> Sid Gillman <END> , won a decisive 51–10 victory over the Boston Patriots for the 1963 AFL Championship.
Confident that his team was capable of beating the NFL-champion Chicago Bears (he had the Chargers' rings inscribed with the phrase "World Champions"),  <START:person> Gillman <END>  approached NFL Commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  and proposed a final championship game between the two teams.
 <START:person> Rozelle <END>  declined the offer; however, the game would be instituted three seasons later.
Watershed years (1964–65).
A series of events throughout the next few years demonstrated the AFL's ability to achieve a greater level of equality with the NFL.
On January 29, 1964, the AFL signed a lucrative $36 million television contract with NBC (beginning in the 1965 season), which gave the league money it needed to compete with the NFL for players.
An NFL owner was quoted as saying to NFL Commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  that "They don't have to call us 'Mister' anymore".
A single-game attendance record was set on November 8, 1964, when 61,929 fans packed Shea Stadium to watch the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.
The bidding war for players between the AFL and NFL escalated in 1965.
The Chiefs drafted University of Kansas star  <START:person> Gale Sayers <END>  in the first round of the 1965 AFL draft (held November 28, 1964), while the Chicago Bears did the same in the NFL draft.
 <START:person> Sayers <END>  eventually signed with the Bears.
A similar situation occurred when the New York Jets and the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals both drafted University of Alabama quarterback  <START:person> Joe Namath <END> .
In what was viewed as a key victory for the AFL,  <START:person> Namath <END>  signed a $427,000 contract with the Jets on January 2, 1965 (the deal included a new car).
It was the highest amount of money ever paid to a collegiate football player, and is cited as the strongest contributing factor to the eventual merger between the two leagues.
In early 1965, the AFL considered adding its first expansion team, to begin play in Atlanta in 1966.
An AFL franchise was awarded to  <START:person> Rankin Smith <END>  of that city.
The NFL quickly offered  <START:person> Smith <END>  a franchise, which  <START:person> Smith <END>  accepted.
In March 1965,  <START:person> Joe Robbie <END>  had met with Commissioner  <START:person> Foss <END>  to inquire about an expansion franchise for Miami, Florida.
On May 6, after Atlanta's exit,  <START:person> Robbie <END>  secured an agreement with Miami mayor  <START:person> Robert King Higho <END>  to bring a team to Miami.
League expansion was approved at a meeting held on June 7, and on August 16 the AFL's ninth franchise was officially awarded to  <START:person> Robbie <END>  and television star  <START:person> Danny Thomas <END> .
The Miami Dolphins joined the league for a fee of $7.5 million and started play in the AFL's Eastern Division in 1966.
Escalation and merger (1966–67).
In 1966, the rivalry between the AFL and NFL reached an all-time peak.
On April 7,  <START:person> Joe Foss <END>  resigned as AFL commissioner.
His successor was Oakland Raiders head coach and general manager  <START:person> Al Davis <END> , who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise.
No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under  <START:person> Davis <END>  started to recruit players already on NFL squads.
 <START:person> Davis <END> 's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL.
Although  <START:person> Davis <END> 's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues.
Alarmed with the rate of spending in the league, Hilton Hotels forced  <START:person> Barron Hilton <END>  to relinquish his stake in the Chargers as a condition of maintaining his leadership role with the hotel chain.
The same month  <START:person> Davis <END>  was named commissioner, several NFL owners, along with Dallas Cowboys general manager  <START:person> Tex Schramm <END> , secretly approached  <START:person> Lamar Hunt <END>  and other AFL owners and asked the AFL to merge.
They held a series of secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching.
Hunt and  <START:person> Schramm <END>  completed the basic groundwork for a merger of the two leagues by the end of May, and on June 8, 1966, the merger was officially announced.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft.
The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues.
The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, NFL commissioner  <START:person> Pete Rozelle <END>  would remain as commissioner of the merged league, and additional expansion teams would eventually be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring it to a 28-team league.
The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years.
In protest,  <START:person> Davis <END>  resigned as AFL commissioner on July 25 rather than remain until the completion of the merger, and  <START:person> Milt Woodard <END>  was named President of the AFL.
On January 15, 1967, the first-ever World Championship Game between the champions of the two separate professional football leagues, the AFL-NFL Championship Game (retroactively referred to as Super Bowl I), was played in Los Angeles.
After a close first half, the NFL champion Green Bay Packers overwhelmed the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs, 35–10.
The loss reinforced for many the notion that the AFL was an inferior league.
Packers head coach  <START:person> Vince Lombardi <END>  stated after the game, "I do not think they are as good as the top teams in the National Football League."
The second AFL-NFL Championship (Super Bowl II) yielded a similar result.
The Oakland Raiders—who had easily beaten the Houston Oilers to win their first AFL championship—were overmatched by the Packers, 33–14.
The more experienced Packers capitalized on a number of Raiders miscues and never trailed.
Green Bay defensive tackle  <START:person> Henry Jordan <END>  offered a compliment to Oakland and the AFL, when he said, "... the AFL is becoming much more sophisticated on offense.
I think the league has always had good personnel, but the blocks were subtler and better conceived in this game."
The AFL added its tenth and final team on May 24, 1967, when it awarded the league's second expansion franchise to an ownership group from Cincinnati, Ohio, headed by NFL legend  <START:person> Paul Brown <END> .
Although  <START:person> Brown <END>  had intended to join the NFL, he agreed to join the AFL when he learned that his team would be included in the NFL once the merger was completed.
The Cincinnati Bengals began play in the 1968 season, finishing last in the Western Division.
Legitimacy and the end of an era (1968–70).
While many AFL players and observers believed their league was the equal of the NFL, their first two Super Bowl performances did nothing to prove it.
However, on November 17, 1968, when NBC cut away from a game between the Jets and Raiders to air the children's movie " <START:person> Heidi <END> ," the ensuing uproar helped disprove the notion that fans still considered the AFL an inferior product.
The perception of AFL inferiority forever changed on January 12, 1969, when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.
The Colts, who entered the contest favored by as many as 18 points, had completed the 1968 NFL season with a 13–1 record, and won the NFL title with a convincing 34–0 win over the Cleveland Browns.
Led by their stalwart defense—which allowed a record-low 144 points—the 1968 Colts were considered one of the best-ever NFL teams.
By contrast, the Jets had allowed 280 points, the highest total for any division winner in the two leagues.
They had also only narrowly beaten the favored Oakland Raiders 27–23 in the AFL championship game.
Jets quarterback  <START:person> Joe Namath <END>  recalled that in the days leading up to the game, he grew increasingly angry when told New York had no chance to beat Baltimore.
Three days before the game, a frustrated  <START:person> Namath <END>  responded to a heckler at the Touchdown Club in Miami by declaring, "We're going to win Sunday, I'll guarantee you."
 <START:person> Namath <END>  and the Jets made good on his guarantee as they held the Colts scoreless until late in the fourth quarter.
The Jets won, 16–7, in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in American sports history.
With the win, the AFL finally achieved parity with the NFL and legitimized the merger of the two leagues.
That notion was reinforced one year later in Super Bowl IV, when the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs upset the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings, 23–7, in the last championship game to be played between the two leagues.
The  <START:person> Vikings <END> , favored by 12½ points, were held to just 67 rushing yards.
The last game in AFL history was the AFL All-Star Game, held in Houston's Astrodome on January 17, 1970.
The Western All-Stars, led by Chargers quarterback  <START:person> John Hadl <END> , defeated the Eastern All-Stars, 26–3.
 <START:person> Hadl <END>  was named the game's Most Valuable Player.
Prior to the start of the 1970 NFL season, the merged league was organized into two conferences of three divisions each.
All ten AFL teams made up the bulk of the new American Football Conference.
To avoid having an inequitable number of teams in each conference, the leagues voted to move three NFL teams to the AFC.
Motivated by the prospect of an intrastate rivalry with the Bengals as well as by personal animosity toward  <START:person> Paul Brown <END> , Cleveland Browns owner  <START:person> Art Modell <END>  quickly offered to include his team in the AFC.
He helped persuade the Pittsburgh Steelers (the Browns' archrivals) and Baltimore Colts (who shared the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. market with the Washington Redskins) to follow suit, and each team received US $3 million to make the switch.
All the other NFL squads became part of the National Football Conference.
Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver  <START:person> Charlie Joiner <END> , who started his career with the Houston Oilers (1969), was the last AFL player active in professional football, retiring after the 1986 season, when he played for the San Diego Chargers.
Legacy.
Overview.
The American Football League stands as the only professional football league to successfully compete against the NFL.
When the two leagues merged in 1970, all ten AFL franchises and their statistics became part of the new NFL.
Every other professional league that had competed against the NFL before the AFL-NFL merger had folded completely: the three previous leagues named "American Football League" and the All-America Football Conference.
From an earlier AFL (1936–1937), only the Cleveland Rams (now the St. Louis Rams) joined the NFL and are currently operating, as are the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers from the AAFC.
A third AAFC team, the Baltimore Colts (not related to the 1953–1983 Baltimore Colts or to the current Indianapolis Colts franchise), played only one year in the NFL, disbanding at the end of the 1950 season.
The league resulting from the merger was a 26-team juggernaut (since expanded to 32) with television rights covering all of the Big Three television networks and teams in close proximity to almost all of the top 40 metropolitan areas, a fact that has precluded any other competing league from gaining traction since the merger; failed attempts to mimic the AFL's success included the World Football League (1974–75), United States Football League (1983–85), XFL (2001) and United Football League (2009–2012).
The AFL was also the most successful of numerous upstart leagues of the 1960s and 1970s that attempted to challenge a major professional league's dominance.
All nine teams that were in the AFL at the time the merger was agreed upon were accepted into the league intact (as was the tenth team added between the time of the merger's agreement and finalization).
For comparison, the World Hockey Association (1972–79) managed to have four of its six remaining teams merged into the National Hockey League, which actually caused the older league to contract a franchise, but WHA teams were forced to disperse the majority of their rosters and restart as expansion teams.
The merged WHA teams were also not financially sound, as three of the four were forced to relocate within 20 years.
The American Basketball Association (1967–76) managed to have only four of its teams merged into the National Basketball Association, and the rest of the league was forced to fold.
The Continental League, a proposed third league for Major League Baseball that was to begin play in 1961, never played a single game.
Rule changes.
The NFL adopted some of the innovations introduced by the AFL immediately and a few others in the years following the merger.
One was including the names on player jerseys.
The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a stopwatch used by the referee.
The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960.
The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it.
The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s).
All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the "AFL" than like the old-line NFL.
The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.
Television.
The NFL also adapted how the AFL used the growing power of televised football games, which were bolstered with the help of major network contracts (first with ABC and later with NBC).
With that first contract with ABC, the AFL adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds were divided equally among member clubs.
It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the Dallas Texans and the defending champion Houston Oilers.
At the time it was the longest professional football championship game ever played.
The AFL also appealed to fans by offering a flashier style of play (just like the ABA in basketball), compared to the more conservative game of the NFL.
Long passes ("bombs") were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as  <START:person> John Hadl <END> ,  <START:person> Daryle Lamonica <END>  and  <START:person> Len Dawson <END> .
Despite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks.
For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL.
It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.
Expanding and reintroducing the sport to more cities.
The AFL took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises.
 <START:person> Hunt <END> 's vision not only brought a new professional football league to California and New York, but introduced the sport to Colorado, restored it to Texas and later to fast-growing Florida, as well as bringing it to New England for the first time in 12 years.
Buffalo, having lost its original NFL franchise in 1929 and turned down by the NFL at least twice (1940 and 1950) for a replacement, returned to the NFL with the merger.
The return of football to Kansas City was the first time that city had seen professional football since the NFL's Kansas City Blues/Cowboys of the 1920s; the arrival of the Chiefs, and the contemporary arrival of the St. Louis Football Cardinals, brought professional football back to Missouri for the first time since the temporary St. Louis Gunners of 1934.
If not for the AFL, at least 17 of today's NFL teams would probably never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and seven clubs that were instigated by the AFL's presence to some degree.
Three NFL franchises were awarded as a direct result of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Minnesota Vikings, who were awarded to  <START:person> Max Winter <END>  in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Atlanta Falcons, whose franchise went to  <START:person> Rankin Smith <END>  to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's Miami Dolphins; and the New Orleans Saints, because of successful anti-trust legislation which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians.
In the case of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL had long sought to return to the Dallas area after the Dallas Texans folded in 1952, but was originally met with strong opposition by Washington Redskins owner  <START:person> George Preston Marshall <END> , who had enjoyed a monopoly as the only NFL team to represent the American South.
 <START:person> Marshall <END>  later changed his position after future-Cowboys owner  <START:person> Clint Murchison <END>  bought the rights to Washington's fight song "Hail to the Redskins" and threatened to prevent  <START:person> Marshall <END>  from playing it at games.
By then, the NFL wanted to quickly award the new Dallas franchise to  <START:person> Murchison <END>  so the team could immediately begin play and complete with the AFL's Texans.
As a result, the Cowboys played its inaugural season in 1960 without the benefit of the NFL draft.
As part of the merger agreement, additional expansion teams would be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring the league to 28 franchises; this requirement was fulfilled when the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began play in 1976.
In addition, had it not been for the existence of the Oilers from 1960 to 1996, the Houston Texans also would likely not exist today; the 2002 expansion team restored professional football in Houston after the original charter AFL member Oilers relocated to become the Tennessee Titans.
 <START:person> Kevin Sherrington <END>  of "The Dallas Morning News" has argued that the presence of AFL and the subsequent merger radically altered the fortunes of the Pittsburgh Steelers, saving the team "from stinking".
Before the merger, the Steelers had long been one of the NFL's worst teams.
Constantly lacking the money to build a quality team, the Steelers had only posted eight winning seasons, and just one playoff appearance, since their first year of existence in 1933.
They also finished with a 1-13 record in 1969, tied with the Chicago Bears for the worst record in the NFL.
The $3 million indemnity that the Steelers received for joining the AFC with the rest of the former AFL teams after the merger helped them rebuild into a contender, drafting eventual-Pro Football Hall of Famers like  <START:person> Terry Bradshaw <END>  and  <START:person> Joe Greene <END> , and ultimately winning four Super Bowls in the 1970s.
Since the 1970 merger, the Steelers have the NFL's highest winning percentage, the most total victories, the most trips to either conference championship game, are tied with the Dallas Cowboys for the most trips to the Super Bowl, and have won an NFL-record six Super Bowl championships.
Effects on players.
Perhaps the greatest social legacy of the AFL was the domino effect of its policy of being more liberal than the entrenched NFL in offering opportunity for black players.
While the NFL was still emerging from thirty years of segregation influenced by Washington Redskins' owner  <START:person> George Preston Marshall <END> , the AFL actively recruited from small and predominantly black colleges.
The AFL's color-blindness led not only to the explosion of black talent on the field, but to the eventual entry of blacks into scouting, coordinating, and ultimately head coaching positions, long after the league ceased to exist.
The AFL's free agents came from several sources.
Some were players who could not find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the Canadian Football League.
In the late 1950s, many players released by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their luck with the CFL, and later returned to the states to play in the AFL.
In the league's first years, players such as Oilers'  <START:person> George Blanda <END> , Chargers/Bills'  <START:person> Jack Kemp <END> , Texans'  <START:person> Len Dawson <END> , the NY Titans'  <START:person> Don Maynard <END> , Raiders/Patriots/Jets'  <START:person> Babe Parilli <END> , Pats'  <START:person> Bob Dee <END>  proved to be AFL standouts.
Other players such as the Broncos'  <START:person> Frank Tripucka <END> , the Pats'  <START:person> Gino Cappelletti <END> , the Bills'  <START:person> Cookie Gilchrist <END>  and the Chargers' Tobin Rote,  <START:person> Sam DeLuca <END>  and  <START:person> Dave Kocourek <END>  also made their mark to give the fledgling league badly needed credibility.
Rounding out this mix of potential talent were the true "free agents", the walk-ons and the "wanna-be's", who tried out in droves for the chance to play professional American football.
After the AFL-NFL merger agreement in 1966, and after the AFL's Jets defeated the "best team in the history of the NFL", the Colts, a popular misconception fostered by the NFL and spread by media reports was that the AFL defeated the NFL because of the Common Draft instituted in 1967.
This apparently was meant to assert that the AFL could not achieve parity as long as it had to compete with the NFL in the draft.
But the 1968 Jets had less than a handful of "common draftees".
Their stars were honed in the AFL, many of them since the Titans days.
As noted below, the AFL got its share of stars long before the "common draft".
Players who chose the AFL to develop their talent included  <START:person> Lance Alworth <END>  and  <START:person> Ron Mix <END>  of the Chargers, who had also been drafted by the NFL's San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts respectively.
Both eventually were elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame after earning recognition during their careers as being among the best at their positions.
Among specific teams, the 1964 Buffalo Bills stood out by holding their opponents to a pro football record 913 yards rushing on 300 attempts, while also recording fifty quarterback sacks in a 14-game schedule.
Another example is cited by the University of Kansas website, which describes the 1961 Bluebonnet Bowl, won by  <START:person> KU <END> , and goes on to say "Two Kansas players, quarterback  <START:person> John Hadl <END>  and fullback  <START:person> Curtis McClinton <END> , signed professional contracts on the field immediately after the conclusion of the game.
 <START:person> Hadl <END>  inked a deal with the "[AFL]" San Diego Chargers, and  <START:person> McClinton <END>  went to the "[AFL]" Dallas Texans."
Between them, in their careers  <START:person> Hadl <END>  and  <START:person> McClinton <END>  combined for an American Football League Rookie of the Year award, seven AFL All-Star selections, two Pro Bowl selections, a team MVP award, two AFL All-Star Game MVP awards, two AFL championships, and a World Championship.
And these were players selected by the AFL long "before" the "Common Draft".
In 2009, a five-part series, "", on the "Showtime Network", refuted many of the long-held misconceptions about the AFL.
In it,  <START:person> Abner Haynes <END>  tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the  <START:person> Haynes <END>  home; the NFL Cowboys'  <START:person> Tex Schramm <END>  is quoted as saying that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's Dallas Texans, they would very likely have lost;  <START:person> George Blanda <END>  makes a case for more AFL players being inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of  <START:person> Famer Willie Brown <END>  was cut by the Houston Oilers because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker  <START:person> Charlie Hennigan <END>  in practice.
Later, when  <START:person> Brown <END>  was with the Broncos,  <START:person> Hennigan <END>  needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break  <START:person> Lionel Taylor <END> 's Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season.
 <START:person> Hennigan <END>  caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by  <START:person> Brown <END> :  <START:person> Blanda <END> 's point being that if  <START:person> Hennigan <END>  could do so well against a Hall of Fame db, he deserves induction, as well.
Influence on professional football coaching.
The AFL also spawned coaches whose style and techniques have profoundly affected the play of professional football to this day.
In addition to AFL greats like  <START:person> Hank Stram <END> ,  <START:person> Lou Saban <END> ,  <START:person> Sid Gillman <END>  and  <START:person> Al Davis <END>  were eventual hall of fame coaches such as  <START:person> Bill Walsh <END> , a protégé of  <START:person> Davis <END>  with the AFL Oakland Raiders for one season; and  <START:person> Chuck Noll <END> , who worked for  <START:person> Gillman <END>  and the AFL LA/San Diego Chargers from 1960 through 1965.
Others include  <START:person> Buddy Ryan <END>  (AFL's New York Jets),  <START:person> Chuck Knox <END>  (Jets),  <START:person> Walt Michaels <END>  (Jets), and  <START:person> John Madden <END>  (AFL's Oakland Raiders).
Additionally, many prominent coaches began their pro football careers as players in the AFL, including  <START:person> Sam Wyche <END>  (Cincinnati Bengals),  <START:person> Marty Schottenheimer <END>  (Buffalo Bills),  <START:person> Wayne Fontes <END>  (Jets), and two-time Super Bowl winner  <START:person> Tom Flores <END>  (Oakland Raiders).
 <START:person> Flores <END>  also has a Super Bowl ring as a player (1969 Kansas City Chiefs).
AFL 50th Anniversary Celebration.
As the influence of the AFL continues through the present, the 50th anniversary of its launch was celebrated during 2009.
The season-long celebration began in August with the 2009 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio between two AFC teams (as opposed to the AFC-vs-NFC format the game first adopted in 1971).
The opponents were two of the original AFL franchises, the Buffalo Bills and Tennessee Titans (the former Houston Oilers).
Bills' owner  <START:person> Ralph C. Wilson Jr. <END>  (a 2009 Hall of Fame inductee) and Titans' owner  <START:person> Bud Adams <END>  were the only surviving members of the Foolish Club, the eight original owners of AFL franchises.
The Hall of Fame Game was the first of several "Legacy Weekends," during which each of the "original eight" AFL teams sported uniforms from their AFL era.
Each of the 8 teams took part in at least two such "legacy" games.
On-field officials also wore red-and-white-striped AFL uniforms during these games.
In the fall of 2009, the Showtime pay-cable network premiered "", a 5-part documentary series produced by NFL Films that features vintage game film and interviews as well as more recent interviews with those associated with the AFL.
The NFL sanctioned a variety of "Legacy" gear to celebrate the AFL anniversary, such as "throwback" jerseys, T-shirts, signs, pennants and banners, including items with the logos and colors of the Dallas Texans, Houston Oilers, and New York Titans, the three of the Original Eight AFL teams which have changed names or venues.
A December 5, 2009 story by  <START:person> Ken Belson <END>  in the "New York Times" quotes league officials as stating that AFL "Legacy" gear made up twenty to thirty percent of the league's annual $3 billion merchandise income.
Fan favorites were the Denver Broncos' vertically striped socks, which could not be re-stocked quickly enough.
AFL franchises.
Today, two of the NFL's eight divisions are composed entirely of former AFL teams, the AFC West (Broncos, Chargers, Chiefs, and Raiders) and the AFC East (Bills, Dolphins, Jets, and Patriots).
Additionally, the Bengals now play in the AFC North and the Tennessee Titans (formerly the Oilers) play in the AFC South.
AFL playoffs.
From 1960 to 1968, the AFL determined its champion via a single-elimination playoff game between the winners of its two divisions.
The home teams alternated each year by division, so in 1968 the Jets hosted the Raiders, even though Oakland had a better record (this was changed in 1969).
In 1963, the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots finished tied with identical records of 7–6–1 in the AFL East Division.
There was no tie-breaker protocol in place, so a one-game playoff was held in War Memorial Stadium in December.
The visiting Patriots defeated the host Bills 26–8.
The Patriots traveled to San Diego as the Chargers completed a three-game season sweep over the weary Patriots with a 51–10 victory.
A similar situation occurred in the 1968 season, when the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs finished the regular season tied with identical records of 12–2 in the AFL West Division.
The Raiders beat the Chiefs 41–6 in a division playoff to qualify for the AFL Championship Game.
In 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, Professional Football's first "wild card" playoffs were conducted.
A four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other division.
The Chiefs upset the Raiders in Oakland 17–7 in the league's Championship, the final AFL game played.
The Kansas City Chiefs were the first Super Bowl champion to win two road playoff games and the first wildcard team to win the Super Bowl, although the term "wildcard" was coined by the media, and not used officially until several years later.
AFL Championship Games.
"Italics" – Super Bowl Appearance, Bold Super Bowl Victory AFL All-Star games.
The AFL did not play an All-Star game after its first season in 1960, but did stage All-Star games for the 1961 through 1969 seasons.
All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions played each other after every season except 1965.
That season, the league champion Buffalo Bills played all-stars from the other teams.
After the 1964 season, the AFL All-Star game had been scheduled for early 1965 in New Orleans' Tulane Stadium.
After numerous black players were refused service by a number of area hotels and businesses, black and white players alike called for a boycott.
Led by Bills players such as  <START:person> Cookie Gilchrist <END> , the players successfully lobbied to have the game moved to Houston's Jeppesen Stadium.

As chosen by 1969 AFL Hall of Fame Selection Committee Members: AFL records.
The following is a sample of some records set during the existence of the league.
The NFL considers AFL statistics and records equivalent to its own.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer  Albrecht Dürer <END>  (; ]; 21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528) was a German painter, printmaker, mathematician, and theorist born in Nuremberg.
His high-quality woodcut prints established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, and he has been conventionally regarded as the greatest artist of the Northern Renaissance.
His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books.
The woodcuts, such as the "Apocalypse" series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work.
His well-known engravings include the "Knight, Death, and the Devil" (1513), "Saint  <START:person> Jerome <END>  in his Study" (1514) and "Melencolia I" (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation.
His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.
This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.
Early life (1471–90).
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had between fourteen and eighteen children.
His father,  <START:person> Albrecht Dürer the Elder <END> , was a successful goldsmith, originally  <START:person> Ajtósi <END> , who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from Ajtós, near Gyula in Hungary.
The German name "Dürer" is a translation from the Hungarian, "Ajtósi".
Initially, it was "Türer," meaning doormaker, which is "ajtós" in Hungarian (from "ajtó", meaning door).
A door is featured in the coat-of-arms the family acquired.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer <END>  the Younger later changed "Türer", his father's diction of the family's surname, to "Dürer", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect.
 <START:person> Albrecht Dürer the Elder <END>  married  <START:person> Barbara Holper <END> , the daughter of his master, when he himself became a master in 1467.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's godfather was  <START:person> Anton Koberger <END> , who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's birth and quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four printing-presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad.
 <START:person> Koberger <END> 's most famous publication was the "Nuremberg Chronicle", published in 1493 in German and Latin editions.
It contained an unprecedented 1,809 woodcut illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the Wolgemut workshop.
Dürer may well have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.
Because  <START:person> Dürer <END>  left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources.
After a few years of school,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father.
Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to  <START:person> Michael Wolgemut <END>  at the age of fifteen in 1486.
A self-portrait, a drawing in silverpoint, is dated 1484 ( <START:person> Albertina <END> , Vienna) "when I was a child," as his later inscription says.
Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books.
Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades.
It had strong links with Italy, especially Venice, a relatively short distance across the Alps.
"Wanderjahre" and marriage (1490–94).
After completing his term of apprenticeship,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  followed the common German custom of taking "Wanderjahre"—in effect gap years —in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Dürer was to spend about four years away.
He left in 1490, possibly to work under  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END> , the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Dürer's arrival at Colmar in 1492.
It is unclear where  <START:person> Dürer <END>  travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to Frankfurt and the Netherlands.
In Colmar,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was welcomed by  <START:person> Schongauer <END> 's brothers, the goldsmiths  <START:person> Caspar <END>  and  <START:person> Paul <END>  and the painter  <START:person> Ludwig <END> .
In 1493 Dürer went to Strasbourg, where he would have experienced the sculpture of  <START:person> Nikolaus Gerhaert <END> .
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's first painted self-portrait (now in the Louvre) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancée in Nuremberg.
In early 1492  <START:person> Dürer <END>  travelled to Basel to stay with another brother of  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END> , the goldsmith  <START:person> Georg <END> .
Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was married to  <START:person> Agnes Frey <END>  following an arrangement made during his absence.
 <START:person> Agnes <END>  was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city.
However, no children resulted from the marriage.
First journey to Italy (1494–95).
Within three months of his marriage,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of plague in Nuremberg.
He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps.
Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving "Nemesis".
In Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world.
Through Wolgemut's tutelage,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had learned how to make prints in drypoint and design woodcuts in the German style, based on the works of  <START:person> Martin Schongauer <END>  and the Housebook Master.
He also would have had access to some Italian works in Germany, but the two visits he made to Italy had an enormous influence on him.
He wrote that  <START:person> Giovanni Bellini <END>  was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice.
His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably  <START:person> Antonio Pollaiuolo <END>  with his interest in the proportions of the body,  <START:person> Mantegna <END> ,  <START:person> Lorenzo di Credi <END>  and others.
Dürer probably also visited Padua and Mantua on this trip.
Return to Nuremberg (1495–1505).
On his return to Nuremberg in 1495,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this).
Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513.
His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as "The Men's Bath House" (ca.
1496).
These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.
It is now thought unlikely that  <START:person> Dürer <END>  cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman.
However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.
Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block.
Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.
His famous series of sixteen great designs for the "Apocalypse" is dated 1498, as is his engraving of" St. Michael Fighting the Dragon".
He made the first seven scenes of the "Great Passion" in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints.
The "Seven Sorrows Polyptych", commissioned by  <START:person> Frederick III <END>  of Saxony in 1496, was executed by  <START:person> Dürer <END>  and his assistants c. 1500.
Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the "Life of the Virgin", which he did not finish for some years.
Neither these, nor the "Great Passion," were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.
During the same period  <START:person> Dürer <END>  trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings.
It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith.
In 1496 he executed the "Prodigal Son", which the Italian Renaissance art historian  <START:person> Giorgio Vasari <END>  singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality.
He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably "Nemesis" (1502), "The Sea Monster" (1498), and "Saint  <START:person> Eustace <END> " (c.
1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals.
His landscapes of this period, such as "Pond in the Woods" and "Willow Mill", are quite different from his earlier watercolours.
There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography.
He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures.
Prints are highly portable and these works made Dürer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.
The Venetian artist  <START:person> Jacopo <END>  de' Barbari, whom  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and  <START:person> Dürer <END>  said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and proportion from him.
De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so  <START:person> Dürer <END>  began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation.
A series of extant drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of "Adam and Eve" (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces.
This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.
Dürer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the "Betende Hände" (English: "Praying Hands", c. 1508  <START:person> Albertina <END> , Vienna), a study for an apostle in the  <START:person> Heller <END>  altarpiece.
He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his "Young Hare" (1502) and the "Great Piece of Turf" (1503, both also  <START:person> Albertina <END> ).
Second journey to Italy (1505–1507).
In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in tempera on linen.
These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the Paumgartner altarpiece and the "Adoration of the Magi".
In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507.
By this time  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied.
In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo.
This was the altar-piece known as the "Adoration of the Virgin" or the "Feast of Rose Garlands".
It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence.
It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor  <START:person> Rudolf II <END>  and taken to Prague.
Other paintings  <START:person> Dürer <END>  produced in Venice include "The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch", "Christ Disputing with the Doctors" (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.
Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507–1520).
Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520.
His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including  <START:person> Raphael <END> ,  <START:person> Giovanni Bellini <END>  and — mainly through  <START:person> Lorenzo di Credi <END>  —  <START:person> Leonardo da Vinci <END> .
Between 1507 and 1511  <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: "Adam and Eve" (1507), "The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand" (1508, for  <START:person> Frederick <END>  of Saxony), "Virgin with the Iris" (1508), the altarpiece "Assumption of the Virgin" (1509, for  <START:person> Jacob Heller <END>  of Frankfurt), and "Adoration of the Trinity" (1511, for  <START:person> Matthaeus Landauer <END> ).
During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the  <START:person> Life of the Virgin <END> , both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series.
The post-Venetian woodcuts show Dürer's development of chiaroscuro modelling effects, creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.
Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512.
Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516.
However, in 1513 and 1514  <START:person> Dürer <END>  created his three most famous engravings: "Knight, Death, and the Devil" (1513, probably based on  <START:person> Erasmus <END> 's treatise "Enchiridion militis Christiani"), "St.
 <START:person> Jerome <END>  in his Study", and the much-debated "Melencolia I" (both 1514).
In 1515, he created his "woodcut of a Rhinoceros" which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself.
An image of the Indian rhinoceros, the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.
In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515 and portraits in tempera on linen in 1516.
Patronage of  <START:person> Maximilian I. From <END>  1512,  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  I became  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's major patron.
His commissions included "The Triumphal Arch", a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by  <START:person> Pirckheimer <END> 's translation of  <START:person> Horapollo <END> 's "Hieroglyphica".
The design program and explanations were devised by  <START:person> Johannes Stabius <END> , the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter  <START:person> Jörg Kölderer <END>  and the woodcutting itself by  <START:person> Hieronymous Andreae <END> , with  <START:person> Dürer <END>  as designer-in-chief.
The Arch was followed by "The Triumphal Procession", the program of which was worked out in 1512 by and includes woodcuts by  <START:person> Albrecht Altdorfer <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Springinklee <END> , as well as Dürer.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in lithography.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including  <START:person> Lucas Cranach the Elder <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Baldung <END> .
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before  <START:person> Maximilian <END> 's death in 1519.
Journey to the Netherlands (1520–21).
 <START:person> Maximilian <END> 's sudden death came at a time when  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was concerned he was losing "my sight and freedom of hand" (perhaps caused by arthritis) and increasingly affected by the writings of  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> .
In July 1520  <START:person> Dürer <END>  made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor,  <START:person> Charles V <END> , who was to be crowned at Aachen.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal.
In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of  <START:person> Stefan Lochner <END> ), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw  <START:person> Michelangelo <END> 's  <START:person> Madonna <END>  of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired  <START:person> van Eyck <END> 's altarpiece), and Zeeland.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much.
This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time.
Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.
While providing valuable documentary evidence, Dürer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one.
For example,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  offered his last portrait of  <START:person> Maximilian <END>  to his daughter,  <START:person> Margaret <END>  of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after  <START:person> Margaret <END>  disliked the portrait and declined to accept it.
During this trip he also met  <START:person> Bernard van Orley <END> ,  <START:person> Jan Provoost <END> ,  <START:person> Gerard Horenbout <END> ,  <START:person> Jean Mone <END> ,  <START:person> Joachim Patinir <END>  and  <START:person> Tommaso Vincidor <END> , though he did not, it seems, meet  <START:person> Quentin Matsys <END> .
At the request of Christian II of Denmark,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait.
There he saw "the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land"—the Aztec treasure that  <START:person> Hernán Cortés <END>  had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor  <START:person> Charles V <END>  following the fall of Mexico.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote that this treasure "was much more beautiful to me than miracles.
These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins".
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies.
Having secured his pension,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps malaria —which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.
Final years in Nuremberg (1521–28).
On his return to Nuremberg,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a  <START:person> Sacra Conversazione <END> , though neither was completed.
This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and fortification.
However, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  produced comparatively little as an artist.
In painting, there was only a portrait of , a , , and two panels showing St.  <START:person> John <END>  with St. Peter in and St. Paul with St. Mark in the .
This last great work, the Four Apostles, was given by  <START:person> Dürer <END>  to the City of Nuremberg—although he was given 100 guilders in return.
As for engravings,  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise.
The portraits include  <START:person> Cardinal-Elector Albert <END>  of Mainz;  <START:person> Frederick <END>  the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar  <START:person> Willibald Pirckheimer <END> ;  <START:person> Philipp Melanchthon <END> , and  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  of Rotterdam.
For those of the Cardinal,  <START:person> Melanchthon <END> , and  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician  <START:person> Ulrich Starck <END> ,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.
Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend  <START:person> Willibald Pirckheimer <END> , whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images.
He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  and other scholars.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime.
"The Four Books on Measurement" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and  <START:person> Kepler <END> .
The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527.
"The Four Books on Human Proportion" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins—a considerable sum.
His large house (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer  <START:person> Bernhard Walther <END> ), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark.
It is now a museum.
He is buried in the "Johannisfriedhof" cemetery.
Dürer and the Reformation.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> 's ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote of his desire to draw  <START:person> Luther <END>  in his diary in 1520: "And God help me that I may go to Dr.  <START:person> Martin Luther <END> ; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties."
In a letter to  <START:person> Nicholas Kratzer <END>  in 1524,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  wrote "because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics."
Most tellingly,  <START:person> Pirckheimer <END>  wrote in a letter to  <START:person> Johann Tscherte <END>  in 1530: "I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our  <START:person> Albert <END>  of blessed memory...but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse."
Dürer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525.
Notably,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had contacts with various reformers, such as  <START:person> Zwingli <END> ,  <START:person> Andreas Karlstadt <END> , Melanchthon,  <START:person> Erasmus <END>  and  <START:person> Cornelius Grapheus <END>  from whom  <START:person> Dürer <END>  received  <START:person> Luther <END> 's 'Babylonian Captivity' in 1520.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's later works have also been claimed to show Protestant sympathies.
For example, his woodcut of "The Last Supper" of 1523 has often been understood to have an evangelical theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the Gospel, as well the inclusion of the Eucharistic cup, an expression of Protestant utraquism, although this interpretation has been questioned.
The delaying of the engraving of St Philip, completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was not an iconoclast, in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.
Legacy and influence.
Dürer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities.
His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as  <START:person> Raphael <END> ,  <START:person> Titian <END> , and  <START:person> Parmigianino <END> , all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.
His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the "Little Masters" who attempted few large engravings but continued  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's themes in small, rather cramped compositions.
 <START:person> Lucas van Leyden <END>  was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century.
The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Dürer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ( <START:person> Giulio Campagnola <END>  and  <START:person> Christofano Robetta <END> ), or whole prints ( <START:person> Marcantonio Raimondi <END>  and  <START:person> Agostino Veneziano <END> ).
However,  <START:person> Dürer <END> 's influence became less dominant after 1515, when  <START:person> Marcantonio <END>  perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.
In painting,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles.
His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the "Dürer Renaissance" of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by  <START:person> D'Arcy Thompson <END>  in his book "On Growth and Form".
The Lutheran Church remembers  <START:person> Dürer <END>  as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with  <START:person> Lucas Cranach the Elder <END>  and  <START:person> Hans Burgkmair <END> .
The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and  <START:person> Matthias Grünewald <END>  on August 5.
Theoretical works.
In all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the German language rather than in Latin, Dürer used graphic expressions based on a vernacular, craftsmen's language.
For example, 'Schneckenlinie' ('snail-line') was his term for a spiral form.
Thus,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  contributed to the expansion in German prose which  <START:person> Martin Luther <END>  had begun with his translation of the Bible.
"Four Books on Measurement".
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on geometry is called the "Four Books on Measurement" ("Underweysung der  <START:person> Messung <END>  mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt" or "Instructions for Measuring with Compass and Ruler").
The first book focuses on linear geometry.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's geometric constructions include helices, conchoids and epicycloids.
He also draws on Apollonius, and  <START:person> Johannes Werner <END> 's 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522.
The second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular polygons.
Here Dürer favours the methods of  <START:person> Ptolemy <END>  over Euclid.
The third book applies these principles of geometry to architecture, engineering and typography.
In architecture Dürer cites  <START:person> Vitruvius <END>  but elaborates his own classical designs and columns.
In typography,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent.
However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system.
The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra.
Here Dürer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention.
In all these,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  shows the objects as nets.
Finally,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective.
It was in Bologna that Dürer was taught (possibly by  <START:person> Luca Pacioli <END>  or  <START:person> Bramante <END> ) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della  <START:person> Francesca <END> .
He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by  <START:person> Alberti <END>  and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of  <START:person> Leonardo da Vinci <END> .
Although  <START:person> Dürer <END>  made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles.
In addition to these geometrical constructions,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  discusses in this last book of "Underweysung der Messung" an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.
"Four Books on Human Proportion".
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's work on human proportions is called the "Four Books on Human Proportion" ("Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion") of 1528.
The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height.
Dürer based these constructions on both  <START:person> Vitruvius <END>  and empirical observations of, "two to three hundred living persons," in his own words.
The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an Albertian system, which Dürer probably learned from  <START:person> Francesco di Giorgio <END> 's 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525.
In the third book, Dürer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of convex and concave mirrors; here  <START:person> Dürer <END>  also deals with human physiognomy.
The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.
Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Dürer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'.
 <START:person> Dürer <END>  rejected  <START:person> Alberti <END> 's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety.
Nonetheless,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code.
In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naïve approval (' <START:person> Wohlgefallen <END> ') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass').
However, unlike  <START:person> Alberti <END>  and  <START:person> Leonardo <END> ,  <START:person> Dürer <END>  was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images.
Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Dürer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.
In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things.
 <START:person> Dürer <END> 's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that "one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year."
List of works.
For lists of  <START:person> Albrecht Dürer <END> 's works, see:   <START:person> Ann Widdecombe  Ann Noreen Widdecombe <END> , DSG (born 4 October 1947) is a former British Conservative Party politician and has been a novelist since 2000.
She is a Privy Councillor and was the Member of Parliament for Maidstone from 1987 to 1997 and for Maidstone and The Weald from 1997 to 2010.
She was a social conservative and a member of the Conservative Christian Fellowship.
She retired from politics at the 2010 general election.
Since 2002 she has also made numerous television and radio appearances, including as a television presenter.
She is a convert from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism.
As an MP,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was known for opposing the legality of abortion, her opposition to various issues of LGBT equality, her support for the re-introduction of the death penalty and the retention of blasphemy laws.
Early life.
Born in Bath, Somerset,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is the daughter of  <START:person> Rita Noreen <END>  (née  <START:person> Plummer <END> ; 1911-2007) and Ministry of Defence civil servant  <START:person> James Murray Widdecombe <END> .
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END> 's maternal grandfather,  <START:person> James Henry Plummer <END> , was born to an Irish Catholic family of English descent in Crosshaven, County Cork in 1874.
She attended the Royal Naval School in Singapore, and La Sainte Union Convent School in Bath.
She then read Latin at the University of Birmingham and later attended Lady  <START:person> Margaret Hall <END> , Oxford, to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE).
She worked for Unilever (1973–75) and then as an administrator at the University of London (1975–87) before entering Parliament.
Councillor.
From 1976 to 1978,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was a councillor on Runnymede District Council in Surrey.
She contested the seat of Burnley in Lancashire in the 1979 general election and then, against  <START:person> David Owen <END> , the Plymouth Devonport seat in the 1983 general election.
Member of Parliament.
She was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1987 general election as member for the constituency of Maidstone (which became Maidstone and The Weald in 1997).
Political views.
As an MP,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  expressed conservative views, including opposition to abortion; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become Health Secretary as long as this involved responsibility for abortions.
Although a committed Christian, she has characterised the issue as one of life and death on which her view had been the same when she was agnostic.
Along with  <START:person> John Gummer <END>  MP, she converted from the Church of England to the Catholic Church following the decision of the Church of England on the Ordination of women as priests.
In her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, she called for a zero tolerance policy of prosecution, albeit with only £100 fines as the punishment, for users of cannabis.
This was well received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  consistently opposed LGBT equality.
On the issue of an equal age of consent, she said in 2000: "I do not believe that issues of equality should override the imperatives of protecting the young."
In 2003,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  proposed an amendment opposing repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act, which banned the promotion of homosexuality by local governments.
Out of the 17 parliamentary votes considered by the Public Whip website to concern equal rights for homosexuals,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  took the opposing position in 15 cases, not being present at the other two votes.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has also expressed her opposition to same-sex marriage, introduced by  <START:person> David Cameron <END> 's government in 2014, claiming that "the state must have a preferred model" and "a union that is generally open to procreation".
She is a committed animal lover and one of the few Conservative MPs to have consistently voted for the ban on fox hunting.
She has expressed a variety of views on climate change but has been opposed to legislation reducing emissions.
Her views on the subject appear to have hardened over time.
In 2007, she wrote that she did not want to belittle the issue but was sceptical of the claims that specific actions would prevent catastrophe, then in 2008 that her doubts had been "crystalised" by  <START:person> Nigel Lawson <END> 's book "An Appeal to Reason", before stating in 2009 that "There is no climate change, hasn’t anybody looked out of their window recently?"
She was one of the five MPs who voted against the Climate Change Act 2008.
In 2011 she expressed the view that "climate change money should go to armed services".
Over the years,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has expressed her support for a reintroduction of the death penalty, which was abolished in the UK in 1965.
She notably spoke of her support for its reintroduction for the worst cases of murder in the aftermath of the murder of two 10-year-old girls from  <START:person> Soham <END> , Cambridgeshire, in August 2002, in the  <START:person> Soham <END>  murders.
She supported the argument that the death penalty would have deterrent value, as within five years of its abolition the national murder rate had more than doubled.
In government.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  joined  <START:person> John Major <END> 's government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security in 1990.
In 1993, she was moved to the Department of Employment, and she was promoted to Minister of State the following year.
In 1995, she joined the Home Office as Minister of State for Prisons and visited every prison in Britain.
Shadow Cabinet.
After the fall of the Conservative government to Labour in 1997, she served as Shadow Health Secretary between 1998 and 1999 and later as Shadow Home Secretary between 1999 and 2001 under  <START:person> William Hague <END> .
Leadership contest and backbenches.
During the 2001 Conservative leadership election, she could not find sufficient support amongst Conservative MPs for her leadership candidacy.
She first supported  <START:person> Michael Ancram <END> , who was eliminated in the first round, and then  <START:person> Kenneth Clarke <END> , who lost in the final round.
She afterwards declined to serve in  <START:person> Iain Duncan Smith <END> 's Shadow Cabinet (although she indicated on the television programme "When Louis Met...", prior to the leadership contest, that she wished to retire to the backbenches anyway).
In the 2005 leadership election, she initially supported  <START:person> Kenneth Clarke <END>  again.
Once he was eliminated, she turned support towards  <START:person> Liam Fox <END> .
Following  <START:person> Fox <END> 's subsequent elimination, she took time to reflect before finally declaring for  <START:person> David Davis <END> .
She expressed reservations over the eventual winner  <START:person> David Cameron <END> , feeling that he did not, like the other candidates, have a proven track record, and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his A-List policy, which she has said is "an insult to women".
At the October 2006 Conservative Conference, she was Chief Dragon in a political version of the television programme "Dragons' Den", in which A-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal, which was then torn apart by her team of  <START:person> Rachel Elnaugh <END> ,  <START:person> Oliver Letwin <END>  and  <START:person> Michael Brown <END> .
In an interview with "Metro" in September 2006 she stated that if Parliament were of a normal length, it was likely she would retire at the next general election.
She confirmed her intention to stand down to "The Observer"'s Pendennis diary in September 2007, and again in October 2007 after Prime Minister  <START:person> Gordon Brown <END>  quashed speculation of an autumn 2007 general election.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.
When the expenses claims were leaked, however,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was described by "The Daily Telegraph" as one of the "saints" amongst all MPs.
In May 2009, following the resignation of  <START:person> Michael Martin <END>  as Speaker of the House of Commons, it was reported that  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election.
On 11 June 2009, she confirmed her bid to be the Speaker.
She made it through to the second ballot but came last and was eliminated.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  retired from politics at the 2010 general election.
It was rumoured that she would be a Conservative candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner in 2012, but she refused.
She has since spoken about her opposition to the Coalition Government and her surprise at not being given a peerage by  <START:person> David Cameron <END> .
Recognition.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was appointed an Honorary Fellow of Canterbury Christ Church University at a ceremony held at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 January 2009.
Personal life and family.
Until her retirement at the 2010 general election,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  divided her time between her two homes – one in London and one in the village of Sutton Valence, Kent, in her constituency.
She sold both of these properties, however, upon deciding to retire at the next general election.
She shared her home in London with her widowed mother,  <START:person> Rita Widdecombe <END> , until  <START:person> Rita <END> 's death, on 25 April 2007, aged 95.
In March 2008, she purchased a house in Haytor, on Dartmoor in Devon, to where she has now retired.
Her brother,  <START:person> Malcolm <END>  (1937–2010), who was an Anglican Canon in Bristol, retired in May 2009 and died of metastatic oesophageal cancer on 12 October 2010.
Her nephew,  <START:person> Rev Roger Widdecombe <END> , is an Anglican priest.
She has never married nor had any children.
In November 2007 on BBC Radio 4 she described how a journalist once produced a profile on her with the assumption that she had had at least "one sexual relationship", to which  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  replied: "Be careful, that's the way you get sued".
When interviewer  <START:person> Jenni Murray <END>  asked if she had ever had a sexual relationship,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  laughed "it's nobody else's business".
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has a fondness for cats and has a section of her website devoted to all the pet cats with which she has shared her life.
In a recent interview,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  talked about her appreciation of music despite describing herself as "pretty well tone-deaf".
Religious views.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is a practising Catholic.
She converted in 1993 after leaving the Church of England.
Her reasons for leaving the latter were many, as she explained to reporters from the "New Statesman": In 2010,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  turned down an offer to be Britain's next ambassador to the Holy See, being prevented from accepting by suffering a detached retina.
She was made a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope  <START:person> Benedict XVI <END>  for services to politics and public life on 31 January 2013.
Controversies.
In 1990, following the assassination of the Conservative politician  <START:person> Ian Gow <END>  by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Eastbourne by-election for his seat in the House of Commons was won by the Liberal Democrat  <START:person> David Bellotti <END> .
Upon the announcement,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  told the voters that the IRA would be "toasting their success".
In 1996,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END> , as prisons minister, defended the Government's policy to shackle pregnant prisoners with handcuffs and chains when in hospital receiving ante-natal care.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  told the Commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping.
"Some MPs may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape.
Unfortunately this is not true.
The fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners, and since 1990, 20 women have escaped from hospitals".
 <START:person> Jack Straw <END> , Labour's Home Affairs spokesman at the time, said it was "degrading and unnecessary" for a woman to be shackled at any stage .
In 1997, during the Conservative leadership election of  <START:person> William Hague <END> ,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  spoke out against  <START:person> Michael Howard <END> , under whom she had served when he was Home Secretary.
She remarked that "there is something of the night about him".
The remark was considered to be extremely damaging to  <START:person> Howard <END> , who was frequently satirised as a vampire thereafter.
He came last in the poll.
 <START:person> Howard <END>  went on to become party leader in 2003, however, and  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  then stated, "I explained fully what my objections were in 1997 and I do not retract anything I said then.
But this is 2005 and we have to look to the future and not the past."
In 2001, when  <START:person> Michael Portillo <END>  was running for leader of the Conservative Party,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  described him and his allies as "backbiters".
She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.
Media work and appearances.
In 2002, she took part in the ITV programme "Celebrity Fit Club".
Also in 2002 she took part in a  <START:person> Louis Theroux <END>  television documentary, depicting her life, both in and out of politics.
In March 2004 she briefly became "The Guardian" newspaper's agony aunt, introduced with an  <START:person> Emma Brockes <END>  interview.
In 2005 BBC Two showed six episodes of "The Widdecombe Project", an agony aunt television programme.
In 2005, she appeared in a new series of "Celebrity Fit Club", but this time as a panel member dispensing wisdom and advice to the celebrities taking part.
Also in 2005, she presented the show " <START:person> Ann Widdecombe <END>  to the Rescue" in which she acted as an agony aunt, dispensing no-nonsense advice to disputing families, couples, and others across the UK.
In 2005, she also appeared in a discussion programme on Five to discuss who had been England's greatest monarch since the  <START:person> Norman Conquest <END> ; her choice of monarch was  <START:person> Charles II <END> .
She was the guest host of news quiz "Have I Got News for You" twice, in 2006 and 2007.
Following her second appearance,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  vowed she would never appear on the show again because of comments made by panellist  <START:person> Jimmy Carr <END> .
She wrote, "His idea of wit is a barrage of filth and the sort of humour most men grow out of in their teens... [T]here's no amount of money for which I would go through those two recording hours again.
At one stage I nearly walked out."
She did, however, stand by her appraisal of regular panellists  <START:person> Ian Hislop <END>  and  <START:person> Paul Merton <END> , whom she has called "the fastest wits in showbusiness".
In 2007, she awarded the "University Challenge" trophy to the winners.
In the same year, she was cast as herself in "The Sound of Drums", the 12th episode of the third series of the science-fiction drama "Doctor Who" supporting Mr  <START:person> Saxon <END> , the alias of the Master.
Since 2007,  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  has fronted a television series called "Ann Widdecombe Versus", on ITV1, in which she speaks to various people about things related to her as an MP, with an emphasis on confronting those responsible for problems she wished to tackle.

In October 2010, she appeared on BBC One's "Strictly Come Dancing", partnered by  <START:person> Anton du Beke <END> , winning the support of some viewers despite low marks from the judges.
After nine weeks of routines strongly flavoured by comedy the couple had received enough support in the public vote to stay in the contest.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was eliminated from the competition on Sunday 5 December after the public vote had been combined with the judges' score; she was with  <START:person> Scott Maslen <END>  of "EastEnders" in the bottom two.
 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is currently filming a new quiz show with herself as questionmaster, for the Sky Atlantic channel, called "Cleverdicks".

The matter was resolved when the company reversed the suspension.
In November 2006, she moved into the house of an Islington Labour Councillor to experience life on a council estate, her response to her experience being "Five years ago I made a speech in the House of Commons about the forgotten decents.
I have spent the last week on estates in the Islington area finding out that they are still forgotten."
In January 2011  <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  was joint President of the North of England Education Conference in Blackpool.

 <START:person> Widdecombe <END>  is a Patron of the charity Safe Haven for Donkeys in the Holy Land (SHADH) and in 2014 visited the SHADH Donkey Sanctuary in Palestine.
 <START:person> Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie  Antoine Thomson <END>  d'Abbadie d'Arrast (3 January 1810 – 19 March 1897) was a French explorer, geographer, ethnologist, linguist and astronomer notable for his travels in Ethiopia during the first half of the 19th century.
He was the older brother of  <START:person> Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie <END> , with whom he traveled.
Biography.
He was born in the Irish city of Dublin from a partially Basque noble family of the French province of  <START:person> Soule <END> .
His father,  <START:person> Michel Abbadie <END> , was born in Arrast-Larrebieu and his mother was Irish.
His grandfather  <START:person> Jean-Pierre <END>  was an abbot and a notary in Soule.
The family moved to France in 1818 where the brothers received a careful scientific education.
In 1827,  <START:person> Antoine <END>  received a bachelier (bachelor) degree in Toulouse.
Starting in 1829, he began his education in Paris, where he studied law.
He married  <START:person> Virginie Vincent de Saint-Bonnet <END>  on 21 February 1859, and settled in Hendaye where he purchased 250ha to build a castle, and became the mayor of the city from 1871 to 1875.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END>  was a knight of the Legion of Honour, which he received on 27 September 1850, and a member of the French Academy of Sciences.
He died in 1897, and bequeathed the  <START:person> Abbadi <END>  domain and castle in Hendaye, yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences.
Science and explorations.
In 1835 the French Academy sent  <START:person> Antoine <END>  on a scientific mission to Brazil, the results being published at a later date (1873) under the title of "Observations relatives à la physique du globe faites au Brésil et en Éthiopie".
In 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at Massawa in February 1838.
They journeyed throughout Ethiopia, travelling as far south as the Kingdom of Kaffa, sometimes together and sometimes separately.
In addition to his studies in the sciences, he delved into the political fray exerting influence in favor of France and the Roman Catholic missionaries.
While in Ethiopia they returned to France in 1848 with notes on the geography, geology, archaeology, and natural history of the region.
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues.
He was especially attacked by  <START:person> Charles Tilstone Beke <END> , who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to Kana.
But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention—hotly contested by  <START:person> Beke <END> —that the Blue Nile was the main stream.
The topographical results of his explorations were published in Paris between 1860 and 1873 in "Géodésie d'Éthiopie", full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps.
Of the "Géographie de l'Éthiopie" (Paris, 1890) only one volume was published.
In "Un Catalogue raisonné de manuscrits éthiopiens" (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian manuscripts collected by  <START:person> Antoine <END> .
He also compiled various vocabularies, including a "Dictionnaire de la langue amariñña" (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the "Shepherd of Hermas", with the Latin version, in 1860.
He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions.
Under the title of "Reconnaissances magnétiques" he published in 1890 an account of the magnetic observations made by him in the course of several journeys to the Red Sea and the Levant.
The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by  <START:person> Arnaud <END>  in 1868 under the title of " <START:person> Douze <END>  ans dans la Haute Ethiopie".
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  was responsible for streamlining techniques towards geodesy, along with inventing a new theodolite for measuring angles.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END> , a Basque and bascophile.
Basque through his father,  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  developed a particular interest about the Basque Language after meeting the Prince  <START:person> Louis Lucien Bonaparte <END>  in London.
He started his academic work on Basque in 1852.
A speaker of both Souletin and  <START:person> Lapurdian <END> , a resident of Lapurdi,  <START:person> Abbadie <END>  considered himself a Basque from  <START:person> Soule <END> .
The popularity of the motto Zazpiak Bat is attributed to  <START:person> Abbadie <END> .
The castle or château.
 <START:person> Abbadie <END>  gave his castle home the name "Abbadia", which is the name still used in Basque.
However in French it is usually referred to as "Chateau d'Abbadie" or "Domaine d'Abbadia", and locally it is not unusual for it to be called "le Chateau d'Antoine d'Abbadie".
The château was built between 1864 and 1879 on a cliff by the Atlantic Ocean, and was designed by  <START:person> Viollet Le Duc <END>  in the Neo Gothic style, and is considered one of the most important examples of French Gothic Revival Architecture.
It is divided in three parts : the observatory and library, the chapel, and the living quarters.
Nowadays the château still belongs to the Academy of Science to which it was bequeathed in 1895 on condition of its producing a catalogue of half-a-million stars within fifty years' time, with the work to be carried out by members of religious orders.
The château was classified as a protected historical monument by France in 1984.
Most of the château property now belongs to the Coastal Protection Agency, and is managed by the city of Hendaye.

Awards and memberships.
 <START:person> Antoine <END>  received the French Legion of Honor on 27 September 1850 with the order of chevalier or knight.
He was a member of the Bureau des Longitudes and also the French Academy of Sciences.
Both brothers received the grand medal of the Paris Geographical Society in 1850.
Adware  Adware, or advertising-supported software, is any software package that automatically renders advertisements in order to generate revenue for its author.
The advertisements may be in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process.
The functions may be designed to analyze which Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there.
The term is sometimes used to refer to software that displays unwanted advertisements.
Advertising-supported software.
In legitimate software, the advertising functions are integrated into or bundled with the program.
Adware is usually seen by the developer as a way to recover development costs, and in some cases, it may allow the software to be provided to the user free of charge or at a reduced price.
The income derived from presenting advertisements to the user may allow or motivate the developer to continue to develop, maintain and upgrade the software product.
The use of advertising-supported software in business is becoming increasingly popular, with a third of IT and business executives in a 2007 survey by McKinsey & Company planning to be using ad-funded software within the following two years.
Advertisement-funded software is also one of the business models for open-source software.
In application software.
Some software is offered in both an advertising-supported mode and a paid, advertisement-free mode.
The latter is usually available by an online purchase of a license or registration code for the software that unlocks the mode, or the purchase and download of a separate version of the software.
Some software authors offer advertising-supported versions of their software as an alternative option to business organizations seeking to avoid paying large sums for software licenses, funding the development of the software with higher fees for advertisers.
Examples of advertising-supported software include the Windows version of the Internet telephony application Skype, and the Amazon Kindle 3 family of e-book readers, which has versions called "Kindle with Special Offers" that display advertisements on the home page and in sleep mode in exchange for substantially lower pricing.
In 2012, Microsoft and its advertising division, Microsoft Advertising, announced that Windows 8, the forthcoming major release of the Microsoft Windows operating system, would provide built-in methods for software authors to use advertising support as a business model.
The idea had been considered since as early as 2005.
In software as a service.
Support by advertising is a popular business model of software as a service (SaaS) on the Web.
Notable examples include the email service Gmail and other Google Apps products, and the social network Facebook.
Microsoft has also adopted the advertising-supported model for many of its social software SaaS offerings.
The Microsoft Office Live service was also available in an advertising-supported mode.
In the view of Federal Trade Commission staff, there appears to be general agreement that software should be considered "spyware" only if it is downloaded or installed on a computer without the user's knowledge and consent.
However, unresolved issues remain concerning how, what, and when consumers need to be told about software installed on their computers for consent to be adequate.
For instance, distributors often disclose in an end-user license agreement that there is additional software bundled with primary software, but some panelists and commenters did not view such disclosure as sufficient to infer consent to the installation of the bundled software.
As malware.
The term "adware" is frequently used to describe a form of malware (malicious software), usually that which presents unwanted advertisements to the user of a computer.
The advertisements produced by adware are sometimes in the form of a pop-up.
When the term is used in this way, the severity of its implication varies.
While some sources rate adware only as an "irritant", others classify it as an "online threat" or even rate it as seriously as computer viruses and trojans.
The precise definition of the term in this context also varies.
Adware that observes the computer user's activities without their consent and reports it to the software's author is called spyware.
Programs have been developed to detect, quarantine, and remove advertisement-displaying malware, including Ad-Aware, AdwCleaner, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, Spyware Doctor and Spybot Search & Destroy.
In addition, almost all commercial antivirus software currently detect adware and spyware, or offer a separate spyware detection package.
 <START:person> Aedui  Aedui <END> ,  <START:person> Haedui <END>  or Hedui (Ancient Greek: Αἰδούοι), were a Gallic people of  <START:person> Gallia Lugdunensis <END> , who inhabited the country between the Arar (Saône) and  <START:person> Liger <END>  (Loire), in today's France.
Their territory thus included the greater part of the modern departments of Saône-et-Loire, Côte-d'Or and Nièvre.
Geography.
The country of the Aedui is defined by reports of them in ancient writings.
The upper Loire formed their western border, separating them from the Bituriges.
The Saône formed their eastern border, separating them from the Sequani.
The  <START:person> Sequani <END>  did not reside in the region of the confluence of the Doubs into the Saône and of the latter into the Rhône, as  <START:person> Caesar <END>  says that the Helvetii, following the pass between the Jura Mountains and the Rhône southwards, which belonged to the Sequani, plundered the territory of the Aedui.
These circumstances explain an apparent contradiction in  <START:person> Strabo <END> , who in one sentence says that the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  lived between the Saône and the Doubs, and in the next, that the  <START:person> Sequani <END>  lived across the Saône (eastward).
Both statements are true, the first in the south, and the second to the north.
History.
According to  <START:person> Livy <END>  (v.
34), they took part in the expedition of Bellovesus into Italy in the 6th century BC.
Before  <START:person> Caesar <END> 's time, they had attached themselves to the Romans, and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the Roman people.
When the Sequani, their hereditary rivals, with the assistance of a Germanic chieftain named Ariovistus, defeated and massacred the Aedui at the Battle of Magetobriga, the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  sent  <START:person> Diviciacus <END> , the druid, to Rome to appeal to the senate for help.
But his mission was unsuccessful.
On his arrival in  <START:person> Gaul <END>  (58 BC),  <START:person> Caesar <END>  restored their independence.
In spite of this, the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  joined the Gallic coalition against  <START:person> Caesar <END>  ("B.
G." vii.
42), but after the surrender of Vercingetorix at Alesia, were glad to return to their allegiance.
 <START:person> Augustus <END>  dismantled their native capital Bibracte on  <START:person> Mont Beuvray <END> , and substituted a new town with a half-Roman, half-Gaulish name,  <START:person> Augustodunum <END>  (modern Autun).
In 21, during the reign of  <START:person> Tiberius <END> , they revolted under  <START:person> Julius Sacrovir <END> , and seized Augustodunum, but were soon put down by  <START:person> Gaius Silius <END>  (Tacitus "Ann."
iii.
43-46).
The Aedui were the first of the Gauls to receive from the emperor  <START:person> Claudius <END>  the distinction of "jus honorum"; thus being the first Gauls permitted to become senators.
The oration of Eumenius, in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place Augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected.
The chief magistrate of the Aedui in  <START:person> Caesar <END> 's time was called Vergobretus (according to  <START:person> Mommsen <END> , "judgment-worker"), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death, but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier.
Certain clientes, or small communities, were also dependent upon the Aedui.
It is possible that the  <START:person> Aedui <END>  adopted many of the governmental practices of the Romans, such as electing magistrates and other officials.
Or perhaps this was a natural development in their political system.
It is thought that other Celtic tribes, such as the Remi and the Baiocasses, also elected their leaders.
Bibliography.
<br>   <START:person> Aelia Capitolina  Aelia Capitolina <END>  (; Latin in full: "COLONIA ÆLIA CAPITOLINA") was a Roman colony, built under the emperor  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  on the site of Jerusalem, which was in ruins since the siege of 70 AD, leading in part to the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136.
Foundation.
Jerusalem was still in ruins from the First Jewish–Roman War in 70.
 <START:person> Josephus <END>  – a contemporary historian and hagiographer who was born in Jerusalem and fought the Romans in that war – reports that "Jerusalem ... was so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations, that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once been a place of habitation."
When the Roman Emperor  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  vowed to rebuild Jerusalem from the wreckage in 130, he considered reconstructing Jerusalem as a gift to the Jewish people.
The Jews awaited with hope, but then after  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  visited Jerusalem, he was told that rebuilding the Second Temple would encourage sedition.
He then decided to rebuild the city as a Roman colony which would be inhabited by his legionaries.
 <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's new plans included temples to the major regional deities, and certain Roman gods, in particular Jupiter Capitolinus.
The Jewish Bar Kokhba revolt, which took the Romans three years to suppress, enraged  <START:person> Hadrian <END> , and he came to be determined to erase Judaism from the province.
Circumcision was forbidden, Iudaea province was renamed Syria Palaestina and Jews (formally all circumcised men) were banned from entering the city on pain of death.
Christianity.
According to Eusebius, the Jerusalem church was scattered twice, in 70 and 135, with the difference that from 70-130 the bishops of Jerusalem have evidently Jewish names, whereas after 135 the bishops of  <START:person> Aelia Capitolina <END>  appear to be Greeks.
Eusebius' evidence for continuation of a church at Aelia Capitolina is confirmed by the Bordeaux Pilgrim.
Name.
"Aelia" came from  <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's "nomen gentile", "Aelius", while "Capitolina" meant that the new city was dedicated to "Jupiter Capitolinus", to whom a temple was built on the site of the former Jewish temple, the Temple Mount.
The Latin name "Aelia" is the source of the Arabic term  <START:person> Iliyā <END> ' (إلياء), an early Islamic name for Jerusalem.
Plan of the city.
The city was without walls, protected by a light garrison of the Tenth Legion, during the Late Roman Period.
The detachment at Jerusalem, which apparently encamped all over the city’s western hill, was responsible for preventing Jews from returning to the city.
Roman enforcement of this prohibition continued through the 4th century.
The urban plan of  <START:person> Aelia Capitolina <END>  was that of a typical Roman town wherein main thoroughfares crisscrossed the urban grid lengthwise and widthwise.
The urban grid was based on the usual central north-south road ("cardo") and central east-west route ("decumanus").
However, as the main cardo ran up the western hill, and the Temple Mount blocked the eastward route of the main decumanus, a second pair of main roads was added; the secondary cardo ran down the Tyropoeon Valley, and the secondary decumanus ran just to the north of the Temple Mount.
The main Hadrianic cardo terminated not far beyond its junction with the decumanus, where it reached the Roman garrison's encampment, but in the Byzantine era it was extended over the former camp to reach the southern walls of the city.
The two cardines converged near the "Damascus Gate", and a semicircular piazza covered the remaining space; in the piazza a columnar monument was constructed, hence the Arabic name for the gate "Bab el-Amud" ("Gate of the Column").
Tetrapylones were constructed at the other junctions between the main roads.
This street pattern has been preserved in the Old City of Jerusalem to the present.
The original thoroughfare, flanked by rows of columns and shops, was about 73 feet (22 meters) wide, but buildings have extended onto the streets over the centuries, and the modern lanes replacing the ancient grid are now quite narrow.
The substantial remains of the western cardo have now been exposed to view near the junction with Suq el-Bazaar, and remnants of one of the tetrapylones are preserved in the 19th century Franciscan chapel at the junction of the Via Dolorosa and Suq Khan ez-Zeit.
As was standard for new Roman cities,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  placed the city's main Forum at the junction of the main cardo and decumanus, now the location for the (smaller) Muristan.
Adjacent to the Forum, at the junction of the same cardo, and the other decumanus,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  built a large temple to  <START:person> Venus <END> , which later became the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; despite 11th century destruction, which resulted in the modern Church having a much smaller footprint, several boundary walls of  <START:person> Hadrian <END> 's temple have been found among the archaeological remains beneath the Church.
The "Struthion Pool" lay in the path of the northern decumanus, so  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  placed vaulting over it, added a large pavement on top, and turned it into a secondary Forum; the pavement can still be seen under the Convent of the Sisters of Zion.
Afghan Turkestan  Afghan Turkestan is a region in northern Afghanistan, on the border with the former Soviet republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
In the 19th century there was a province in Afghanistan named Turkestan Province until abolished by  <START:person> Abdur Rahman <END> , and was centred on  <START:person> Mazari Sharif <END>  and included territory in the modern provinces of Balkh, Jowzjan, Faryab and Sar-e Pol.
The whole territory, from the junction of the Kokcha river with the Amu Darya on the north-east to the province of Herat on the south-west, was some 500 mi in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the Hindu Kush of 114 miles (183 km).
It thus comprised about 57,000 sqmi or roughly two-ninths of the former Kingdom of Afghanistan.
Geography.
The area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the Karakum Desert.
Population.
The bulk of the people are Uzbek and Turkmen with large concentrations of Tajik, Hazara and Pashtuns.
History.
Ancient Balkh or Bactria was an integral part of Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex, and was occupied by Indo-Iranians.
In the 5th century BCE, it became a province of the Achaemenian Empire and later became part of the Seleucid Empire.
About 250 BC Diodotus (Theodotus), governor of Bactria under the Seleucidae, declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to Parthian and nomadic movements about 126 BC.
After this came a Buddhist era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak.
The district was devastated by  <START:person> Genghis Khan <END> , and has never since fully recovered its prosperity.
For about a century it belonged to the Delhi empire, and then fell into Uzbek hands.
In the 18th century it formed part of the dominion of  <START:person> Ahmad Khan Durrani <END> , and so remained under his son  <START:person> Timur <END> .
But under the fratricidal wars of  <START:person> Timur <END> 's sons the separate khanates fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbek chiefs.
At the beginning of the 19th century they belonged to Bukhara; but under the emir  <START:person> Dost Mahommed <END>  the Afghans recovered Balkh and Tashkurgan in 1850,  <START:person> Akcha <END>  and the four western khanates in 1855, and Kunduz in 1859.
The sovereignty over Andkhui, Shibarghan,  <START:person> Saripul <END>  and Maimana was in dispute between Bukhara and Kabul until settled by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 in favour of the Afghan claim.
Under the strong rule of  <START:person> Abdur Rahman <END>  these outlying territories were closely welded to Kabul; but after the accession of  <START:person> Habibullah <END>  the bonds once more relaxed.
In 1890 the district of Qataghan and Badakhshan was divided from Afghan Turkestan and made into the Qataghan-Badakhshan Province.
Administration of the province was assigned to the Northern Bureau in Kabul.
Afyonkarahisar  Afyonkarahisar (], Turkish: "afyon" "poppy, opium", 'kara' "black", 'hisar' "fortress") is a city in western Turkey, the capital of Afyon Province.
Afyon is in mountainous countryside inland from the Aegean coast, 250 km south-west of Ankara along the Akarçay River.
Elevation 1021 m.
Population (2010 census) 173,100  Etymology.
The name Afyon  <START:person> Kara Hisar <END>  (literally "opium black castle" in Turkish), since opium was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock.
Also known simply as Afyon.
Older spellings include  <START:person> Karahisar-i Sahip <END> , Afium-Kara-hissar and Afyon Karahisar.
The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the Turkish Parliament in 2004.
History.
The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time.
It was known to the Hittites as  <START:person> Hapanuwa <END> , and was later occupied by Phrygians, Lydians and Achaemenid Persians until it was conquered by  <START:person> Alexander the Great <END> .
After the death of  <START:person> Alexander <END>  the city (now known as Akroinοn (Ακροϊνόν) or Nikopolis (Νικόπολις) in Ancient Greek), was ruled by the Seleucids and the kings of Pergamon, then Rome and Byzantium.
The Byzantine emperor  <START:person> Leo III <END>  after his victory over Arab besiegers in 740 renamed the city Nicopolis (Greek for "city of victory").
The Seljuq Turks then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to  <START:person> Kara Hissar <END>  ("black castle") after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201 meters above the town.
Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the Sâhib Ata and then the Germiyanids.
The castle was much fought over during the Crusades and was finally conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Beyazid I in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of  <START:person> Timur Lenk <END>  in 1402.
It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.
The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city with the typical Ottoman urban mixture of Turks and Armenians.
During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock.
During the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) campaign (part of the Turkish War of Independence) Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by French, Italian and then Greek forces.
However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region.
After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.
The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name "Afyon") until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.
Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime.
They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the poppy straw method of extraction.
Afyon was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 50 lira banknote of 1927-1938.
Climate.
Afyonkarahisar has a continental climate (Köppen climate classification: "Dsa" and "Dsb"), with cold and snowy winters and warm to hot and dry summers.
Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn.
Afyon today.
Afyon is the centre of an agricultural area and the city has a country town feel to it.
There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey.
However Afyon Kocatepe University opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.
Nowadays Afyon is known for its marble (in 2005 there were 355 marble quarries in the province of Afyon producing high quality white stone), its "sucuk" (spiced sausages), its "kaymak" (meaning either "cream" or a white Turkish Delight) and various handmade weavings.
There is also a large cement factory.
This is a natural crossroads, the routes from Ankara to İzmir and from Istanbul to Antalya intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys.
There are a number of well-established roadside restaurants for travellers to breakfast on the local cuisine.
Some of these places are modern well-equipped hotels and spas; the mineral waters of Afyon are renowned for their healing qualities.
There is also a long string of roadside kiosks selling the local Turkish delight.
Transport.
Afyon is also an important rail junction between İzmir, Konya, Ankara and Istanbul.
Afyon is on the route of the planned high-speed rail line between Ankara and Izmir.

Courses Main sights.
With its rich architectural heritage, the city is a member of the European Association of Historic Towns and Regions .

Atari Jaguar  The Atari Jaguar is a fifth generation home video game console that was developed by Atari Corporation.
The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the Atari brand, originally released in North America in November 1993.
Marketed by  <START:person> Atari <END>  as the first 64-bit video game console, the Jaguar was designed to compete with the 16-bit Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform.
Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 90s, and was designed by Flare Technology, who were tasked by Atari to create two consoles; the Atari Panther, which would compete with the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo, and a successor, the Jaguar, which would surpass the capabilities of any other console on the market at the time.
With development of the Jaguar running ahead of schedule, the Panther was cancelled, and the release of the Jaguar was pushed forward.
It was originally released to test markets in New York City and San Francisco in November 1993, and to the general public in 1994.
Upon release, it was initially criticized for its complex controller design and the console's failure to distinguish itself from its 16-bit competitors.
It was also criticized for its low quality game library, with poorly received games such as "Cybermorph" and "Kasumi Ninja" gaining more publicity than other titles on the system.
The console's multi-chip architecture, making game development for the console difficult, and underwhelming sales contributed to the console's lack of third party support.
This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a limited game library, comprising only 67 licensed titles.
Some games for the system, however, such as "Alien vs Predator", "Tempest 2000" and ports of id Software's "Wolfenstein 3D" and "Doom", are well received by contemporary critics.
Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the Jaguar with a CD-ROM add-on known as the Atari Jaguar CD, though, with the release of the Sega Saturn and Sony's PlayStation in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was eventually discontinued in 1996.
The Jaguar was deemed a commercial failure, and prompted Atari to leave the home video game console market.
After Hasbro Interactive bought out Atari in the late 1990s, the rights to the Jaguar were released into the public domain, with the console being declared an open platform.
Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces homebrew games for the console.
Notable homebrew titles for the Jaguar include "Skyhammer" and "BattleSphere".
Development.
The Jaguar was developed by the members of Flare Technology, a company formed by  <START:person> Martin Brennan <END>  and  <START:person> John Mathieson <END> .
The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the Sega Genesis or the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but they could also be cost-effective.
Impressed by their work on the Konix Multisystem, Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called Flare II, with Atari providing the funding.
Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari Corp.
One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed "Panther"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed "Jaguar"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari Corp. canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.
Reception.
The Jaguar was introduced in 1993 at a price of $249.99,
under a $500 million manufacturing deal with IBM.
The system was initially marketed only in the New York City and the San Francisco Bay areas, under the slogan "Do the Math", claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems.
A US-wide release followed in early 1994.
The Atari Jaguar struggled to attain a substantial user base.
In 1993, Atari reported that they had shipped 17,000 units as part of the system's initial test market.
By the end of 1994, Atari reported that they had sold approximately 100,000 systems and had reduced the price to improve the competitive nature of the console.
By the end of 1995, Sony and Sega had entered the marketplace with competing consoles and Atari's sales declined rapidly.
In Atari's 1995 annual report, they noted: "Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit.
Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively."
Jaguar did earn praise with titles such as "Tempest 2000", "Doom", and "Wolfenstein 3D".
The most successful title during the Jaguar's first year was "Alien vs. Predator".
Both it and "Tempest 2000" were named among the system's defining titles by "GamePro" in 2007.
With such a small library of games to challenge the incumbent 16-bit game consoles, Jaguar's appeal never grew beyond a small gaming audience.
In 2006 IGN editor  <START:person> Craig Harris <END>  rated the Jaguar controller as the worst ever, criticizing the complexity of the "phone keypad".
A version that has six action buttons, the Pro Controller, is suggested for certain games.
Lack of titles was attributable to two main factors: the Jaguar's questionable long-term prospects among third-party game-publishers and the problematic nature of developing games for the Jaguar.
Atari had one opportunity to convince third-party developers, vital for the diversity of Jaguar's game library, with a solid retail-performance, but as things played out, post-holiday sales figures questioned the viability of Atari's business; Atari failed to attract many third-party developers already committed to other game platforms.
In addition, the Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's memory controller, which prevented code execution out of system RAM.
Less severe, but still annoying defects included a buggy UART.
The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code.
Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete.
Writing game-code was often an endurance exercise in the tedious assembler.
In a July 1995 interview with "Next Generation", then-CEO  <START:person> Sam Tramiel <END>  declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the Sega Saturn, and slightly weaker than the PlayStation.
By the end of 1995, Atari's revenues declined by more than half, from US$38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995.<ref name="10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996"></ref> In late 1995, Atari Corp. ran early-morning infomercial advertisements with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system.
The infomercials ran most of the year, but did not significantly sell the remaining stock of Jaguar systems.
In its 10-K405 SEC Filing, filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders of the truly dire nature of the Jaguar business: From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar.
As of December 31, 1995, Atari had approximately 100,000 units of Jaguar in inventory.
Atari had already suffered an ill-fated crash in the mid-1980s as a result of the oversaturation of the video game market by third-party developers.
Production of the Jaguar ceased after Atari Corp. merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover.
In a last-ditch effort to revive the Jaguar, Atari Corp. tried to play down the other two consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only "64-bit" system.
This claim is questioned by some, because the CPU (68000) and GPU executed a 32-bit instruction-set, but sent control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors (or "graphics accelerators").
Atari Corp.'s reasoning that the 32-bit "Tom" and " <START:person> Jerry <END> " chips work in tandem to add up to a 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by "Electronic Gaming Monthly", which commented that "If Sega did the math for the Sega Saturn the way Atari did the math for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine."
Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs.
In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic.
Over the short life of the console, several add-on peripherals were announced.
Even prior to the console's test market launch, Atari had promised a CD-based add-on console, a dial-up internet link with support for online gaming, a virtual reality headset, and an MPEG-2 video card.
However, only the ProController, the Atari Jaguar CD drive, and the JagLink (a simple two-console networking device) reached retail shelves.
A voice modem and virtual reality headset (with infrared head-tracking) existed in prototype form, but were never commercialized (see  <START:person> Loki <END>  and Konix Multisystem for early development).
Reviewing the Jaguar just a few weeks prior to its launch, "GamePro" gave it a "thumbs sideways".
They praised the power of the hardware but criticized the controller, and were dubious of how the software lineup would turn out, commenting that Atari's failure to secure support from key third party publishers such as Capcom was a bad sign.
They concluded that "Like the 3DO, the Jaguar is a risky investment just not quite as expensive."
Legacy.
After the Atari Corporation properties were bought out by Hasbro Interactive in the late 1990s, Hasbro released the rights to the Jaguar, declaring the console an open platform and opening the doors for homebrew development.
A few developers, including Telegames and Songbird Productions, have not only released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past, but also several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following.
In the United Kingdom in 2001, a deal was struck between Telegames and retailer Game to bring the Jaguar to Game's retail outlets.
The machine was initially sold for £29.99 brand new and the software was ranged between £9.99 for more common games such as "Doom" and "Ruiner Pinball", and up to £39.99 for more sought-after releases such as "Defender 2000" and "Checkered Flag".
The machine had a presence in the stores until 2007 when remaining consoles were sold off for £9.99 and games were sold for as low as 97p.
This deal was seen as a move to remain competitive with Game's rival at the time, Gamestation, who were well known for stocking retro formats.
Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, has since purchased the molding plates for the Jaguar's casing as with minor modification they were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera.
The game cartridge molds were reused to create an optional memory expansion card.
In 2015, the molds for the console and cartridges were purchased from Imagin Systems by  <START:person> Mike Kennedy <END> , owner of the "Game Gavel" video game auction website and "Retro Magazine", a Kickstarter funded print and digital retro video game magazine, to manufacture shells for a brand new,  <START:person> Kickstarter <END>  funded, cartridge-based video game console, called the "Retro VGS" (Retro Video Game System).
The purchase of the molds from Imagin Systems was far cheaper than designing and manufacturing entirely new molds, and  <START:person> Kennedy <END>  described their acquisition as "the entire reason [the Retro VGS] is possible".
The Jaguar continues to have a small and dedicated game development circle.
Technical specifications.
From the Jaguar Software Reference manual, page 1: Jaguar is a custom chip set primarily intended to be the heart of a very high-performance games/leisure computer.
It may also be used as a graphics accelerator in more complex systems, and applied to workstation and business uses.
As well as a general purpose CPU, Jaguar contains four processing units.
These are the Object Processor, Graphics Processor,  <START:person> Blitter <END> , and Digital Sound Processor.
Jaguar provides these blocks with a 64-bit data path to external memory devices, and is capable of a very high data transfer rate into external dynamic RAM.
Accessories.
Atari Jaguar CD.
The Atari Jaguar CD or Jag CD is a CD-ROM peripheral that sat on top the Atari Jaguar video game console and plugged in through the cartridge slot.
Memory Track.
Released in 1995, the Atari Jaguar CD "Memory Track" is a cartridge that contains a 128 K EEPROM, allowing Atari Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and saved games.
The Memory Track Program Manager is accessed by pushing the option button while the system is starting, and exited by pushing the * and # keys simultaneously.
Team Tap.
The Atari Jaguar "Team Tap" is a multi-player adapter for use on certain Jaguar games.
It was available by itself, or as a pack-in with the four player game "White Men Can't Jump".
Each Team Tap supports up to 4 players; by plugging Team Taps into both Jaguar controller ports, up to 8 players are supported.
The only games compatible with the Team Tap are "White Men Can't Jump" and "NBA Jam Tournament Edition".
Jaglink Interface.
The Atari Jaguar "Jaglink Interface" enables players to hook two Atari Jaguars connected to two TVs together with a phone cable, allowing multiplayer gaming on two separate screens.
The only games to support this add-on are "DOOM", "BattleSphere", and "AirCars".
The Jaglink is also used to connect the Jaguar to a PC for game development using the JUGS DD (Jaguar Unmodified Game Server Dev Disc) dev system disk for Jaguar CD that was included in "BattleSphere Gold", which also came with the "JUGS Device" (a DB9 to phone cord adapter) to connect a PC to a Jaguar via Jaglink.
Jaglink is also compatible with ICD's CatBox.
 <START:person> Jaglink <END>  came in sets of two.
Atari Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge.
The Atari Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge from B&C Computervisions allows players to boot unencrypted discs on an Atari Jaguar CD system.
CatBox by ICD.
The "CatBox" is an unofficial expansion peripheral for the Atari Jaguar released by the Rockford, Illinois company ICD.
It was originally slated to be released early in the Jaguar's life, in the second quarter of 1994, but was not actually released until 1996.
The ICD CatBox plugs directly into the AV/DSP connectors located in the rear of the Jaguar console and provides three main functions.
These are audio, video, and communications.
It features six output formats, three for audio (line level stereo, RGB monitor, headphone jack with volume control) and three for video (composite, S-Video, and RGB analog component video) making the Jaguar compatible with multiple high quality monitor systems and multiple monitors at the same time.
It is capable of communications methods known as CatNet and RS-232 as well as DSP pass through, allowing the user to connect two or more Jaguars together for multi player games either directly or with modems.
The ICD CatBox features a polished steel casing and red LEDs in the jaguar's eyes on the logo that indicate communications activity.
An IBM AT type null modem cable may be used to connect two Jaguars together.
The CatBox is also compatible with Atari's Jaglink Interface peripheral.
Atari Jaguar VR Headset Prototype.
Atari developed several Virtual Reality headset prototypes for the Jaguar.
There were two models, a blue and grey high resolution unit, and a red and grey low resolution unit.
After Atari merged with JTS in 1996, most of the headsets were reportedly destroyed, but not all of them.
Supposedly, there are only two working units known to be left in existence.
The only game released that was compatible with the Atari Jaguar VR Headset was Missile Command 3D.
Atari Jaguar Cortina Web TV Adapter Prototype.
An adaptor for the Jaguar that allows for WebTV access was revealed in 1998, one prototype is known to exist.
Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator a.k.a.
Jaguar Voice Modem (JVM) Prototype.
In 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it partnered up with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator.
The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled all together, but not before an estimated 100 or so were made.
The JVM as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers.
Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play.
The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is  <START:person> Ultra Vortek <END> , the modem is initialized in the Ultra Vortek start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.
COJAG Arcade Games.
Atari Games licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games.
The system, named COJAG (for "Coin-Op Jaguar"), replaced the 68000 with a 68020 or MIPS R3000-based CPU (depending on the board version), and added a hard drive and more RAM.
It ran the lightgun games "Area 51" and "Maximum Force", which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine.
Other games ("3 On 3 Basketball"; "Fishin' Frenzy"; "Freeze"; "Vicious Circle") were developed but never released.
Atari Jaguar Duo.
The Atari Jaguar Duo was a proposed console similar to the Sega Neptune.
It was an attempt by Atari to combine the Atari Jaguar and Atari Jaguar CD to make a new console.
It was never completed and was thus never released.
After cancelling the console, Atari was bought by Hasbro and ceased all console development.
Australian Army  The Australian Army is Australia's military land force.
It is part of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) along with the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force.
While the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) commands the ADF, the Army is commanded by the Chief of Army (CA).
The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the Minister for Defence.
Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, only in World War II has Australian territory come under direct attack.
History.
The history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods: During its history the Australian Army has fought in a number of major wars, including: Second Boer War (1899–1902), First World War (1914–18), the Second World War (1939–45), Korea War (1950–53), Malayan Emergency (1950–60), Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation (1962–66), Vietnam War (1962–73), and more recently in Afghanistan (2001 – present) and Iraq (2003–2009).
Since 1947 the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations, however the non United Nations sponsored Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai is a notable exception.
Australia's largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 in East Timor, while other ongoing operations include peacekeeping on Bougainville, in the Sinai, and in the Solomon Islands.
Humanitarian relief after 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake in Aceh Province, Indonesia, Operation Sumatra Assist, ended on 24 March 2005.
Current organisation.
The 1st Division comprises a deployable headquarters, while 2nd Division under the command of Forces Command is the main home-defence formation, containing Army Reserve units.
2nd Division's headquarters only performs administrative functions.
The Australian Army has not deployed a divisional-sized formation since 1945 and does not expect to do so in the future.
1st Division.
1st Division carries out high-level training activities and deploys to command large-scale ground operations.
It does not have any combat units permanently assigned.
Forces Command.
Forces Command controls for administrative purposes all non-special-forces assets of the Australian Army.
It is neither an operational nor a deployable command.
Additionally, Forces Command includes the following training establishments: Special Forces.
Special Operations Command comprises a command formation of equal status to the other commands in the ADF.
It is a brigade-sized formation responsible for all of Australia's special-forces assets.
Planned restructuring.
Under a restructuring program known as Plan Beersheba announced in late 2011, the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades will be re-formed as combined-arms multi-role manoeuvre brigades with the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (part of the 3rd Brigade) forming the core of a future amphibious force The force will be known as an Amphibious Ready Element and will utilise the former Royal Navy 16,000-tonne auxiliary Bay class landing ship RFA Largs Bay (L3006), bought for $100 million to become HMAS Choules.
Colours, standards and guidons.
Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as "the Colours".
Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units.
The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units.
Artillery units' guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect.
Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units.
As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners.
Units awarded battle honours have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons.
They are a link to the unit's past and a memorial to the fallen.
Artillery do not have Battle Honours – their single Honour is "Ubique" which means "Everywhere" – although they can received Honour Titles.
The Army is the guardian of the National Flag and as such, unlike the Royal Australian Air Force, does not have a flag or Colours.
The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner.
To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General Sir  <START:person> William Deane <END> , presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the Australian War Memorial on 10 March 2001.
The Banner was presented to the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A), Warrant Officer  <START:person> Peter Rosemond <END> .
The Army Banner bears the Australian Coat of Arms on the obverse, with the dates "1901–2001" in gold in the upper hoist.
The reverse bears the "rising sun" badge of the Australian Army, flanked by seven campaign honours on small gold-edged scrolls: South Africa, World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya-Borneo, South Vietnam, and Peacekeeping.
The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.
Personnel.
Strength.
In the 2010–11 financial year the Army had an average strength of 47,135 personnel: 30,235 permanent (regular) and 16,900 active reservists (part-time).
In addition there are another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.
The regular Army is targeted to expand to 31,000 personnel by 2014–15.
Personnel numbers have trended downwards since a peak in 2010–11 with an actual strength of 28,568 full-time personnel.
Army Reserve numbers are 14,662, which does not include Standby Reserves.
This gives the Army a combined strength of 43,230 active personnel for the year 2013–14.
Rank and insignia.
The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the British Army, and carry mostly the same actual insignia.
For officers the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title "Australia".
The Non-Commissioned Officer insignia are the same up until Warrant Officer ranks, where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).
The ranks of the Australian Army are as follows: Bases.
The Army's operational headquarters, Forces Command, is located at Victoria Barracks in Sydney.
The Australian Army's three regular brigades are based at Robertson Barracks near Darwin, Lavarack Barracks in Townsville and Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane.
The Deployable Joint Force Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks.
Other important Army bases include the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey, Queensland, Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney, Lone Pine Barracks in Singleton, New South Wales and Woodside Barracks near Adelaide, South Australia.
The SASR is based at Campbell Barracks Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.
Puckapunyal north of Melbourne houses the Australian Army's Combined Arms Training Centre, Land Warfare Development Centre, and three of the five principal Combat Arms schools.
Further barracks include Steele Barracks in Sydney, Keswick Barracks in Adelaide, and Irwin Barracks at Karrakatta in Perth.
Dozens of Australian Army Reserve depots are located across Australia.

</dl>  Antiderivative  In calculus, an antiderivative, primitive integral or indefinite integral of a function "f" is a differentiable function "F" whose derivative is equal to the original function "f".
This can be stated mathematically as "F"′ "f".
The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration) and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative.
Antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through the fundamental theorem of calculus: the definite integral of a function over an interval is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.
The discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is antidifference.
Example.
The function "F"("x") = "x"3/3 is an antiderivative of "f"("x") = "x"2.
As the derivative of a constant is zero, "x"2 will have an infinite number of antiderivatives; such as "x"3/3, "x"3/3 + 1, "x"3/3 - 2, etc.
Thus, all the antiderivatives of "x"2 can be obtained by changing the value of C in "F"("x") = "x"3/3 + "C"; where "C" is an arbitrary constant known as the constant of integration.
Essentially, the graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are vertical translations of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the value of "C".
In physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant.
The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity because the derivative of a constant term is zero.
This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on).
Uses and properties.
Antiderivatives are important because they can be used to compute definite integrals, using the fundamental theorem of calculus: if "F" is an antiderivative of the integrable function "f" and "f" is continuous over the interval ["a", "b"], then: Because of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function "f" is sometimes called the "general integral" or "indefinite integral" of "f" and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds: If "F" is an antiderivative of "f", and the function "f" is defined on some interval, then every other antiderivative "G" of "f" differs from "F" by a constant: there exists a number "C" such that "G"("x") = "F"("x") + "C" for all "x".
"C" is called the arbitrary constant of integration.
If the domain of "F" is a disjoint union of two or more intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals.
For instance is the most general antiderivative of formula_4 on its natural domain formula_5 Every continuous function "f" has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative "F" is given by the definite integral of "f" with variable upper boundary: Varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives).
This is another formulation of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
There are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions (like polynomials, exponential functions, logarithms, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions and their combinations).
Examples of these are  "From left to right, the first four are the error function, the Fresnel function, the trigonometric integral, and the logarithmic integral function."
See also Differential  <START:person> Galois <END>  theory for a more detailed discussion.
Techniques of integration.
Finding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives.
For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions.
See the article on elementary functions for further information.
There are various methods available: Antiderivatives of non-continuous functions.
Non-continuous functions can have antiderivatives.
While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that: Assuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals: on the closed interval ["a", "b"].
Then "g" must have either a maximum or minimum "c" in the open interval ("a", "b") and so   Antigonid dynasty  The Antigonid dynasty (; Greek: Ἀντιγονίδαι) was a dynasty of Hellenistic kings descended from  <START:person> Alexander the Great <END> 's general  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  I Monophthalmus ("the One-eyed").
History.
Succeeding the Antipatrid dynasty in much of Macedonia,  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria.
His attempts to take control of the whole of  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's empire led to his defeat and death at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC.
 <START:person> Antigonus <END> 's son  <START:person> Demetrius <END>  I Poliorcetes survived the battle, and managed to seize control of Macedon itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying as a prisoner of Seleucus I Nicator.
After a period of confusion,  <START:person> Demetrius <END> 's son  <START:person> Antigonus <END>  II Gonatas was able to establish the family's control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states, by 276 BC.
Legacy.
It was one of four dynasties established by  <START:person> Alexander <END> 's successors, the others being the Seleucid dynasty, Ptolemaic dynasty and Attalid dynasty.
The last scion of the dynasty,  <START:person> Perseus <END>  of  <START:person> Macedon <END> , who reigned between 179-168 BC, proved unable to stop the advancing Roman legions and  <START:person> Macedon <END> 's defeat at the Battle of Pydna signaled the end of the dynasty.

The ruling members of the Antigonid dynasty were: The Greek rebel against Rome and last King of Macedonia,  <START:person> Andriscus <END> , claimed to be the son of Perseus.
File archiver  A file archiver is a computer program that combines a number of files together into one archive file, or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage.
File archivers may employ lossless data compression in their archive formats to reduce the size of the archive.
Basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives.
The archive files need to store metadata, at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible.
More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the original timestamps, file attributes or access control lists.
The process of making an archive file is called "archiving" or "packing".
Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed "unarchiving", "unpacking" or "extracting".
Unix archivers.
The Unix tools "ar", "tar", "cpio" act as archivers but not compressors.
Users of the Unix tools use additional compression tools, such as gzip, bzip2, or xz, to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file.
The filename extensions are successively added at each step of this process.
For example, archiving a collection of files with "tar" and then compressing the resulting archive file with "gzip" results a file with codice_1 extension.
This approach has two goals: This approach, however, has disadvantages too: Windows archives.
The built-in archiver of Microsoft Windows as well as third-party archiving software, such as WinZip, WinRAR and 7-zip, often use a graphical user interface.
The last three also offer an optional command-line interface but Windows itself does not.
Windows archivers perform both archiving and compression.
Solid compression may or may not be offered, depending on the product: Windows itself does not support it; WinRAR and 7-zip offer it as an option that can be turned on or off.
Artemis  Artemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities.
Her Roman equivalent is  <START:person> Diana <END> .
Some scholars believe that the name, and indeed the goddess herself, was originally pre-Greek.
Homer refers to her as "Artemis Agrotera, Potnia Theron": "Artemis of the wildland, Mistress of Animals".
The Arcadians believed she was the daughter of Demeter.
In the classical period of Greek mythology, Artemis (Ancient Greek: Ἄρτεμις, ] in Classical Attic) was often described as the daughter of Zeus and  <START:person> Leto <END> , and the twin sister of Apollo.
She was the Hellenic goddess of the hunt, wild animals, wilderness, childbirth, virginity and protector of young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows.
The deer and the cypress were sacred to her.
In later Hellenistic times, she even assumed the ancient role of Eileithyia in aiding childbirth.
Etymology.
The name Artemis ("noun", "feminine") is of unknown or uncertain origin and etymology although various ones have been proposed.
For example according to  <START:person> Jablonski <END> , the name is also Phrygian and could be "compared with the royal appellation "Artemas" of  <START:person> Xenophon <END> .
According to  <START:person> Charles Anthon <END>  the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from *"arta", *"art", *"arte", all meaning "great, excellent, holy," thus Artemis "becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus".
 <START:person> Anton Goebel <END>  "suggests the root στρατ or ῥατ, "to shake," and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter".
 <START:person> Babiniotis <END>  while accepting that the etymology is unknown, states that the name is already attested in Mycenean Greek and is possibly of pre-Hellenic origin.
The name could also be possibly related to Greek "árktos" "bear" (from PIE *"h₂ŕ̥tḱos"), supported by the bear cult that the goddess had in Attica (Brauronia) and the Neolithic remains at the Arkoudiotissa Cave, as well as the story about  <START:person> Callisto <END> , which was originally about Artemis (Arcadian epithet "kallisto"); this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger bear cult found further afield in other Indo-European cultures (e.g.,  <START:person> Gaulish Artio <END> ).
It is believed that a precursor of Artemis was worshiped in Minoan Crete as the goddess of mountains and hunting, Britomartis.
While connection with Anatolian names has been suggested, the earliest attested forms of the name "Artemis" are the Mycenaean Greek 𐀀𐀳𐀖𐀵, "a-te-mi-to" /Artemitos/ and 𐀀𐀴𐀖𐀳, "a-ti-mi-te" /Artimitei/, written in Linear B at Pylos.
 <START:person> R. S. P. Beekes <END>  suggested that the "e"/"i" interchange points to a Pre-Greek origin.
Artemis was venerated in  <START:person> Lydia <END>  as "Artimus".
Ancient Greek writers, by way of folk etymology, and some modern scholars, have linked Artemis (Doric "Artamis") to ἄρταμος, "artamos", i.e. "butcher" or, like  <START:person> Plato <END>  did in "Cratylus", to ἀρτεμής, "artemḗs", i.e. "safe", "unharmed", "uninjured", "pure", "the stainless maiden".
Artemis in mythology.
<poem>  <START:person> Leto <END>  bore Apollon and Artemis, delighting in arrows, Both of lovely shape like none of the heavenly gods, As she joined in love to the Aegis-bearing ruler.
</poem>  <START:person> — Hesiod <END>  ,  "Theogony", lines 918–920 (written in the 7th century BCE) Birth.
Various conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology of the birth of Artemis and her twin brother, Apollo.
All accounts agree, however, that she was the daughter of  <START:person> Zeus <END>  and  <START:person> Leto <END>  and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.
An account by  <START:person> Callimachus <END>  has it that Hera forbade  <START:person> Leto <END>  to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island.
Hera was angry with Zeus, her husband, because he had impregnated  <START:person> Leto <END> .
But the island of  <START:person> Delos <END>  (or Ortygia in the Homeric Hymn to Artemis) disobeyed Hera, and  <START:person> Leto <END>  gave birth there.
In ancient Cretan history  <START:person> Leto <END>  was worshipped at Phaistos and in Cretan mythology  <START:person> Leto <END>  gave birth to Apollo and Artemis at the islands known today as the Paximadia.
A "scholium" of Servius on "Aeneid" iii.
72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia by asserting that  <START:person> Zeus <END>  transformed  <START:person> Leto <END>  into a quail ("ortux") in order to prevent Hera from finding out his infidelity, and  <START:person> Kenneth McLeish <END>  suggested further that in quail form  <START:person> Leto <END>  would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.
The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo.
Most stories depict  <START:person> Artemis <END>  as born first, becoming her mother's mid-wife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.
Childhood.
The childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth.
The "Iliad" reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by Hera, climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.
A poem of Callimachus to the goddess "who amuses herself on mountains with archery" imagines some charming vignettes: according to  <START:person> Callimachus <END> , at three years old, Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her six wishes: to remain always a virgin; to have many names to set her apart from her brother Apollo; to be the Phaesporia or Light Bringer; to have a bow and arrow and a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt; to have sixty "daughters of Okeanos", all nine years of age, to be her choir; and for twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested.
She wished for no city dedicated to her, but to rule the mountains, and for the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.
Artemis believed that she had been chosen by the Fates to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo.
All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity.
Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon.
 <START:person> Callimachus <END>  tells how  <START:person> Artemis <END>  spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of Lipara, where Hephaestus and the Cyclops worked.
Okeanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows.
 <START:person> Callimachus <END>  then tells how Artemis visited Pan, the god of the forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs.
She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot.
Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.
Intimacy.
As a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, Orion, won her heart.
Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.
 <START:person> Alpheus <END> , a river god, was in love with Artemis, but he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart.
So he decides to capture her.
 <START:person> Artemis <END> , who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to  <START:person> Alpheus <END> , but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her.
In another story,  <START:person> Alphaeus <END>  tries to rape Artemis' attendant Arethusa.
Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, Artemis Alphaea in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.
 <START:person> Bouphagos <END> , the son of the Titan Iapetos, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her.
Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.
Sipriotes is a boy, who, either because he accidentally sees Artemis bathing or because he attempts to rape her, is turned into a girl by the goddess.
Actaeon.
Multiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary.
The details vary but at the core they involve a great hunter, Actaeon who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs.
Usually the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master.
Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.
According to the standard modern text on the work,  <START:person> Lamar Ronald Lacey <END> 's "The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies", the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her.
For this hubris he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds.
However, in some surviving versions Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her.
Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she, or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of Semele.
Adonis.
In some versions of the story of  <START:person> Adonis <END> , who was a late addition to Greek mythology during the Hellenistic period, Artemis sent a wild boar to kill  <START:person> Adonis <END>  as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than she.
In other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge.
In later myths,  <START:person> Adonis <END>  had been related as a favorite of Aphrodite, and  <START:person> Aphrodite <END>  was responsible for the death of  <START:person> Hippolytus <END> , who had been a favorite of Artemis.
Therefore, Artemis killed  <START:person> Adonis <END>  to avenge Hippolytus’s death.
In yet another version, Adonis was not killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> , but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.
Orion.
Orion was Artemis' hunting companion.
In some versions, he is killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> , while in others he is killed by a scorpion sent by  <START:person> Gaia <END> .
In some versions, Orion tries to seduce Opis, one of Artemis' followers, and she kills him.
In a version by  <START:person> Aratus <END> , Orion takes hold of Artemis' robe and she kills him in self-defense.
In yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion.
According to  <START:person> Hyginus Artemis <END>  once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as Eos did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END> , who was "protective" of his sister's maidenhood.
The Aloadae.
These twin sons of Iphidemia and Poseidon,  <START:person> Otos <END>  and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age.
They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other.
The growth of the Aloadae never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and Hera and take them as wives.
The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them.
The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.
 <START:person> Callisto <END> .
 <START:person> Callisto <END>  was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants.
As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity.
Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo, gained her confidence, then took advantage of her (or raped her, according to Ovid).
As a result of this encounter she conceived a son,  <START:person> Arcas <END> .
Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear.
Arcas almost killed the bear, but  <START:person> Zeus <END>  stopped him just in time.
Out of pity,  <START:person> Zeus <END>  placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of  <START:person> Callisto <END>  the Bear as a constellation.
Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and  <START:person> Callisto <END>  into the heavens as bears, forming the Ursa Minor and Ursa Major constellations.
Iphigenia and the Taurian Artemis.
Artemis punished Agamemnon after he killed a sacred stag in a sacred grove and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess.
When the Greek fleet was preparing at Aulis to depart for Troy to begin the Trojan War, Artemis becalmed the winds.
The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia.
Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer.
Various myths have been told around what happened after Artemis took her.
Either she was brought to  <START:person> Tauros <END>  and led the priests there, or became Artemis' immortal companion.
 <START:person> Niobe <END> .
A Queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion,  <START:person> Niobe <END>  boasted of her superiority to  <START:person> Leto <END>  because while she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven boys and seven girls,  <START:person> Leto <END>  had only one of each.
When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and  <START:person> Artemis <END>  shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound.
Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl.
Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself.
A devastated  <START:person> Niobe <END>  and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept.
The gods themselves entombed them.
Chione.
 <START:person> Chione <END>  was a princess of Pokis.
She was beloved by two gods, Hermes and Apollo, and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once.
Artemis was furious and killed  <START:person> Chione <END>  with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue.
However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.
Atalanta,  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  and the Meleagrids.
Artemis saved the infant Atalanta from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her.
She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters.
But she later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because people said Atalanta was a better hunter.
This is in some stories.
Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, which Artemis had sent to destroy Calydon because King  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices.
In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood, and was awarded the prize of the skin.
She hung it in a sacred grove at Tegea as a dedication to Artemis.
 <START:person> Meleager <END>  was a hero of Aetolia.
King  <START:person> Oeneus <END>  had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the Calydonian Boar.
After the death of  <START:person> Meleager <END> ,  <START:person> Artemis <END>  turned his grieving sisters, the Meleagrids into guineafowl that Artemis loved very much.
Aura.
In Nonnus "Dionysiaca", Aura was Greek goddess of breezes and cool air, daughter of Lelantos and Periboia.
She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood.
One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity.
Artemis asked  <START:person> Nemesis <END>  for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by Dionysus.
Aura became a mad and dangerous killer.
When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, Iakhos, was saved by Artemis.
 <START:person> Iakhos <END>  later became an attendant of Demeter and the leader of Eleusinian Mysteries.
Polyphonte.
 <START:person> Polyphonte <END>  was a young woman who fled home preferring the idea of a virginal life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite.
As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear.
The resulting offspring,  <START:person> Agrius <END>  and  <START:person> Oreius <END> , were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus.
Ultimately the whole family were transformed into birds and more specifically ill portents for mankind.
Trojan War.
Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END>  was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times.
In the "Iliad" she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict.
Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out.
As Artemis fled crying to Zeus,  <START:person> Leto <END>  gathered up the bow and arrows.
Artemis played quite a large part in this war.
Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshiped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans.
At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter.
Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke the promise.
Other sources said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger.
Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery.
In some versions of the myth, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into Hecate, goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.
 <START:person> Aeneas <END>  was helped by Artemis,  <START:person> Leto <END> , and Apollo.
Apollo found him wounded by  <START:person> Diomedes <END>  and lifted him to heaven.
There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.
Worship of Artemis.
Artemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout ancient Greece.
Her best known cults were on the island of  <START:person> Delos <END>  (her birthplace), in Attica at Brauron and Mounikhia (near Piraeus), and in Sparta.
She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows, and accompanied by a deer.
The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new military campaign.
Athenian festivals in honor of Artemis included Elaphebolia, Mounikhia, Kharisteria, and Brauronia.
The festival of Artemis Orthia was observed in Sparta.
Pre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron to serve the Goddess for one year.
During this time, the girls were known as "arktoi", or little she-bears.
A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame.
A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes.
Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged.
She demanded that young girls "act the bear" at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.
Virginal  <START:person> Artemis <END>  was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating Ilithyia, since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin.
During the Classical period in Athens, she was identified with  <START:person> Hecate <END> .
Artemis also assimilated Caryatis (Carya).
Epithets.
As  <START:person> Aeginaea <END> , she was worshiped in Sparta; the name means either huntress of chamois, or the wielder of the javelin (αἰγανέα).
She was worshipped at Naupactus as Aetole; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin.
This "Aetolian Artemis" would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of Ozolian Locris, until it was awarded to the Aetolians by  <START:person> Philip II <END>  of Macedon.
 <START:person> Strabo <END>  records another precinct of "Aetolian Artemos" at the head of the Adriatic.
As Agoraea she was the protector of the agora.
As Agrotera, she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters.
In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local Aeginian goddess, Aphaea.
As  <START:person> Potnia Theron <END> , she was the patron of wild animals; Homer used this title.
As  <START:person> Kourotrophos <END> , she was the nurse of youths.
As Locheia, she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives.
She was sometimes known as  <START:person> Cynthia <END> , from her birthplace on Mount Cynthus on  <START:person> Delos <END> , or Amarynthia from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in Euboea.
She was sometimes identified by the name  <START:person> Phoebe <END> , the feminine form of her brother  <START:person> Apollo <END> 's solar epithet Phoebus.
In Sparta the Artemis "Lygodesma" was worshipped.
This epithet means "willow-bound" from the Gr.
"lygos" (λυγός, willow) and "desmos" (δεσμός, bond).
The willow tree appears in several ancient Greek myths and rituals.
Alphaea, Alpheaea, or Alpheiusa (Gr.
Ἀλφαῖα, Ἀλφεαία, or Ἀλφειοῦσα) was an epithet that Artemis derived from the river god  <START:person> Alpheius <END> , who was said to have been in love with her.
It was under this name that she was worshiped at Letrini in Elis, and in Ortygia.
 <START:person> Artemis Alphaea <END>  was associated with the wearing of masks, largely because of the legend that while fleeing the advances of  <START:person> Alpheius <END> , she and her nymphs escaped him by covering their faces.
Festivals.
 <START:person> Artemis <END>  was born at the sixth day, the reason why it was sacred for her.
Artemis in art.
The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as "Potnia Theron" ("Queen of the Beasts"): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard in her hands, or sometimes a leopard and a lion.
This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as Artemis Orthia, with a sanctuary close by Sparta.
In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt, with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow and arrows.
Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a hunting dog or stag.
When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head.
Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of  <START:person> Niobe <END> .
Artemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the crescent moon, such as also found on  <START:person> Luna <END>  and others.
On June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of "Artemis and the Stag" was sold at Sotheby's auction house in New York state by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery for $25.5 million.
Attributes.
According to the Homeric Hymn to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was  <START:person> Khryselakatos <END> , "of the Golden Shaft", and  <START:person> Iokheira <END>  (Showered by Arrows).
The arrows of Artemis could also bring sudden death and disease to girls and women.
Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father.
The bow of Artemis also became the witness of  <START:person> Callisto <END> 's oath of her virginity.
In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.
Artemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer ( <START:person> Elaphoi Khrysokeroi <END> ).
The bridles of her chariot were also made of gold.
Although quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear.
Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear.
The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis, while Artemis with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing.
As a goddess of maiden dances and songs, Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre.
Fauna.
Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself.
On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred.
Deer were also the first animals she captured.
She caught five golden horned deer called  <START:person> Elaphoi Khrysokeroi <END>  and harnessed them to her chariot.
The third labour of Heracles, commanded by  <START:person> Eurystheus <END> , consisted in catching the Cerynitian Hind alive.
Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive.
Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath.
Artemis got her hunting dogs from Pan in the forest of Arcadia.
Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one these dogs were able to hunt even lions.
Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race.
However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.
The sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started with the  <START:person> Brauron <END>  cult.
Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron.
The Byzantine writer  <START:person> Suidos <END>  relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois.
A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens.
They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them.
A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge.
The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague.
The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').
The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame.
In honor of Artemis' skill, they sacrificed it to her.
Oineus and Adonis were both killed by  <START:person> Artemis <END> ' boar.
Artemis felt pity for the Meleagrids as they mourned for their lost brother,  <START:person> Meleagor <END> , so she transformed them into Guinea Fowl to be her favorite animals.
Hawks were the favored birds of many of the gods, Artemis included.
Flora.
Palm and Cypress were issued to be her birthplace.
Other plants sacred to Artemis are Amaranth and Asphodel.
Artemis as "the Lady of Ephesus".
At Ephesus in Ionia, Turkey, her temple became one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
It was probably the best known center of her worship except for  <START:person> Delos <END> .
There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through "interpretatio graeca" was worshiped primarily as a mother goddess, akin to the Phrygian goddess  <START:person> Cybele <END> , in an ancient sanctuary where her cult image depicted the "Lady of Ephesus" adorned with multiple rounded breast-like protuberances on her chest.
They have been variously interpreted as multiple accessory breasts, as eggs, grapes, acorns, or even bull testes.
Excavation at the site of the "Artemision" in 1987-88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped amber beads that had adorned the ancient wooden "xoanon".
In Acts of the Apostles, Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint  <START:person> Paul <END> 's preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"”
Of the 121 columns of her temple, only one composite, made up of fragments, still stands as a marker of the temple's location.
The rest were used for making churches, roads, and forts.
Artemis in astronomy.
A minor planet, 105 Artemis; a lunar crater; the Artemis Chasma and the  <START:person> Artemis Corona <END>  have all been named for her.
Artemis is the acronym for "Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol", a large bolometer camera in the submillimeter range that was installed in 2010 at the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.
Alcopop  Alcopop (or cooler in Canadian English or spirit cooler in South Africa) is a colloquial term describing certain flavored alcoholic beverages, including: The term "alcopop" (a portmanteau of the words "alcohol" and "sodapop") is used by advocates of tighter restrictions on alcoholic beverage sales, who argue that the beverages are especially appealing to underage drinkers.
Other terms include FAB (flavored alcoholic beverage), FMB (flavored malt beverage), PPS (pre-packaged spirit or premium packaged spirits), and RTD (ready to drink – Australia and New Zealand).
The alcoholic beverage industry does not use the term "alcopop" using terms like wine cooler.
Description.
There is a large variety of beverages produced and marketed around the world as well as within each market which are described as alcopops.
They tend to be sweet and served in small bottles (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in North America, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Europe), and between 4% and 7% ABV.
In Europe, Canada, and South Africa alcopops tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g.
Smirnoff Ice) or rum (e.g.
Bacardi Breezer).
In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as un-hopped beers, depending on the state in which they are sold.
Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring.
Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks.
There are, however, stronger ones that "are" simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g.
Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.
In the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, although some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model, which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.
According to the US Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB): In some Continental European countries, such as Austria and Germany, bottled beer cocktails and shandies are available, which are being marketed the same way like alcopops.
However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.
History.
Wine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when  <START:person> Bartles <END>  and  <START:person> Jaymes <END>  began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when Bacardi introduced the Breezer.
A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with Two Dogs, DNA Alcoholic Spring Water,  <START:person> Hooper <END> 's Hooch and Zima, which was marketed under the title of "malternative beverage".
Wine coolers were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard.
Later,  <START:person> Mike <END> 's Hard Lemonade was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called "violence against lemons".
Smirnoff also came out with another citrus-flavored malt beverage in the United States in the late 1990s called Smirnoff Ice, which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places.
(In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by Diageo as a PPS.)
Some have expressed concern that such drinks might appeal to children as they tend to be sweet and brightly colored.
Many alcopop advertising campaigns have been criticized as trying to make alcopops appeal to young drinkers.
In the United Kingdom, that led to a media outcry during the mid-1990s as the tabloid press associated alcopops with under-age drinking which damaged sales and would lead to off-licences withdrawing them from their stores.
In response to a complaint from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001.
The agency "found no evidence of intent to target minors with the FMB products, packaging, or advertising.
Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data."
The Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, product placement, and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.
"The Commission’s investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs.
Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing" and found that "the majority of FMB drinkers are over the age of 27."
In December 2003, Ireland raised the tax on alcopops to equal that of spirits, the second highest in Europe.
Germany has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 euro per bottle effective August 1, 2004.
To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to wine coolers, which are being marketed the same way.
Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States).
On May 11, 2008, the Australian Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it inline with the tax on spirits.
There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves, possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives.
This tax was revoked during March 2009 meaning the government had to pay back the 290 million collected on the tax.
The Federal Trade Commission report states, "Further, industry-conducted research on consumers over the age of 21 who use FMBs shows that these consumers generally view the FMBs as substitutes for beer, ... This research also concludes that consumers are not likely to consume more than two or three FMBs on any occasion because of the products’ sweetness.
Alcopop brands.
Alcopop brands are numerous and their alcoholic base vary greatly.
Some notable brands include: Smirnoff Ice,  <START:person> Mike <END> 's Hard Lemonade, Bacardi Breezer, Skyy Blue,  <START:person> Jack Daniel <END> 's Hard Cola and in the UK WKD Original Vodka.
Attempts to discourage "alcopops".
Australia.
The Australian government increased the tax on these drinks under the 2008 budget to the same rate as spirits, volumetrically, in an effort to stop binge drinking.
The tax was criticized by the opposition as a tax grab, and voted down in the Senate on March 18, 2009.
Before its rejection, the tax had already raised at least A$290 million after April 2008.
In April 2009, some Labor party MPs planned to resubmit the tax to the Senate, and it was finally approved in August 2009, increasing the cost of the drinks from $39 to $66 a litre.
A 2013 study concluded that the tax had no impact on binge drinking of the drinks by teenagers.
California.
In 2008 AB 346 was signed into law, a bill which requires manufacturers of "alcopops" to carry a 'warning' label stating "ATTENTION: THIS DRINK CONTAINS ALCOHOL."
This bill was praised by groups advocating against alcohol use by minors and younger adults, since these drinks are sometimes favored by young people due to their flavor.
Germany.
On 1 July 2004 the German government increased the tax on mixed drinks based on spirits (e.g.
vodka, rum) by roughly one Euro per 275-ml-bottle in order to stop teenagers drinking excessively, although those drinks were already prohibited to minors under the age of 18.
This had two implications: The most common alcopops, such as Smirnoff Ice or Bacardi Breezer, were nearly taken off the market.
Other manufacturers changed the recipes of their drinks, replacing spirit alcohols by wine or beer, but with the same ABV, enabling these mixed drinks (which are not "alcopops" under German law) to be sold legally to minors 16 and 17 years of age.
South Africa.
In South Africa, "Spirit Coolers" cannot be sold to persons under the age of 18.
They are only sold at liquor stores.
United Kingdom.
In the UK Secretary of State for Health,  <START:person> Patricia Hewitt <END>  called for a tax increase on such products, although this had not yet happened as of October 2013.
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty or ABMT) was a treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems used in defending areas against ballistic missile-delivered nuclear weapons.
Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.
Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years.
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1997 the United States and four former Soviet republics agreed to succeed to the treaty.
In June 2002 the United States withdrew from the treaty, leading to its termination.
Background.
Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming ICBM warheads.
During this period, the US considered the defense of the US as part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange.
As part of this defense, Canada and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called North American Aerospace Defense Command).
By the early 1950s, US research on the Nike Zeus missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of an operational ABM system.
Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as Sprint to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves.
By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed Sentinel.
In 1967, the US announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive Safeguard.
Soviet doctrine called for development of its own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US.
This was achieved with the operational deployment of the A-35 ABM system and its successors, which remain operational to this day.
The development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time.
An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads.
Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would be economically unfeasible: The defenders required one rocket per incoming warhead, whereas the attackers could place 10 warheads on a single missile at a reasonable cost.
To further protect against ABM systems, the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with decoys; R-36M heavy missiles carried as many as 40.
These decoys would appear as warheads to an ABM, effectively requiring engagement of five times as many targets and rendering defense even less effective.
ABM Treaty.
The United States first proposed an anti-ballistic missile treaty at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference during discussions between U.S. Secretary of Defense  <START:person> Robert McNamara <END>  and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union  <START:person> Alexei Kosygin <END> .
 <START:person> McNamara <END>  argued both that ballistic missile defense could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a first-strike against the nation fielding the defense.
 <START:person> Kosygin <END>  rejected this reasoning.
Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks began in November 1969 (SALT I).
By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems.
Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos.
The treaty was signed during the 1972 Moscow Summit on May 26 by the President of the United States,  <START:person> Richard Nixon <END>  and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,  <START:person> Leonid Brezhnev <END> ; and ratified by the US Senate on August 3, 1972.
The 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site.
The sites were Moscow for the USSR and the North Dakota Safeguard Complex for the US, which was already under construction.
Missiles limited by the treaty.
The Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against "strategic ballistic missiles", without attempting to define "strategic".
It was understood that both ICBMs and SLBMs are obviously "strategic".
Both countries did not intend to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs.
The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.
After the SDI announcement.
On March 23, 1983  <START:person> Ronald Reagan <END>  announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, a research program into ballistic missile defense which would be, "consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty".
The project was a blow to  <START:person> Yuri Andropov <END> 's so-called "peace offensive".
 <START:person> Andropov <END>  said that "It is time they [Washington] stopped... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible.
It is insane".
Regardless of the opposition,  <START:person> Reagan <END>  gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system.
The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible.
In "The Nuclear Predicament,"  <START:person> Beckman <END>  claims that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI.
A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a “ragged” Soviet retaliatory response.
Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy.
The Soviets could not afford to ignore  <START:person> Reagan <END> ’s new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans.
By 1987, however, the USSR withdrew its opposition, concluding the SDI posed no threat and scientifically "would never work."
SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result.
SDI research was cut back following the end of  <START:person> Reagan <END> 's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that "missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability."
This was reaffirmed in 1997.
US withdrawal.
Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, in the view of the U.S. Department of State, the treaty continued in force.
An additional memorandum of understanding was prepared in 1997, establishing Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine as successor states to the Soviet Union, for the purposes of the treaty.
On December 13, 2001,  <START:person> George W. Bush <END>  gave Russia notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact—the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.
This led to the eventual creation of the American Missile Defense Agency.
Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited National Missile Defense to protect the United States from nuclear blackmail by a rogue state.
The withdrawal had many critics as well as supporters.
 <START:person> John Rhinelander <END> , a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a "fatal blow" to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and would lead to a "world without effective legal constraints on nuclear proliferation."
The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear first strike.
Russia and the United States signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty in Moscow on May 24, 2002.
This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.

Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  1974 Protocol   Acts of Union 1707  The Acts of Union were two Acts of Parliament: the Union with Scotland Act 1706 passed by the Parliament of England, and the Union with England Act passed in 1707 by the Parliament of Scotland.
They put into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries.
The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate states with separate legislatures, but with the same monarch) into a single, united kingdom named "Great Britain".
The two countries had shared a monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King  <START:person> James VI <END>  of Scotland inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, Queen  <START:person> Elizabeth I. <END> 
Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later Kingdom of Great Britain).
There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.
The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707.
On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the Parliament of Great Britain, based in the Palace of Westminster in London, the home of the English Parliament.
Hence, the Acts are referred to as the Union of the Parliaments.
On the Union, the historian  <START:person> Simon Schama <END>  said "What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."
Historical background.
Previous attempts at union.
England and Scotland were separate states for several centuries before eventual union, and English attempts to take over Scotland by military force in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were ultimately unsuccessful (see the Wars of Scottish Independence).
The first attempts at Union surrounded the foreseen unification of the Royal lines of Scotland and England.
In pursuing the Scottish throne in the 1560s,  <START:person> Mary <END> , Queen of Scots pledged herself to a peaceful union between the two kingdoms.
England and Scotland were ruled by the same king for the first time in 1603 when  <START:person> James VI <END>  of Scotland also became the king of England.
However they remained two separate states until 1 May 1707.
Early  <START:person> Stuart <END>  union.
The first attempt to unite the parliaments of England and Scotland was by  <START:person> Mary <END> 's son, King  <START:person> James VI <END>  and I. On his accession to the English throne in 1603 King  <START:person> James <END>  announced his intention to unite his two realms so that he would not be "guilty of bigamy".
 <START:person> James <END>  used his Royal prerogative powers to take the style of 'King of Great Britain' and to give an explicitly British character to his court and person.
Whilst  <START:person> James <END>  assumed the creation of a full union was a foregone conclusion, the Parliament of England was concerned that the formation of a new state would deprive England of its ancient liberties, taking on the more absolutist monarchical structure  <START:person> James <END>  had previously enjoyed in Scotland.
In the meantime,  <START:person> James <END>  declared that Great Britain be viewed 'as presently united, and as one realm and kingdom, and the subjects of both realms as one people'.
The Scottish and English parliaments established a commission to negotiate a union, formulating an instrument of union between the two countries.
However, the idea of political union was unpopular, and when  <START:person> James <END>  dropped his policy of a speedy union, the topic quietly disappeared from the legislative agenda.
When the House of Commons attempted to revive the proposal in 1610, it was met with a more open hostility.
Union during the interregnum.
The Solemn League and Covenant 1643 sought a forced union of the Church of England into the Church of Scotland, and although the covenant referred repeatedly to union between the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a political union was not spelled out.
In the aftermath of the Civil War, in which the Covenanters had fought for the King,  <START:person> Oliver Cromwell <END>  occupied Scotland and began a process of creating a 'Godly Britannic' Union between the former Kingdoms.
In 1651, the Parliament of England issued the Tender of Union declaration supporting Scotland's incorporation into the Commonwealth and sent Commissioners to Scotland with the express purpose of securing support for Union, which was assented to by the Commissioners (Members of Parliament) in Scotland.
On 12 April 1654,  <START:person> Cromwell <END>  – styling himself Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland – enacted "An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland," which created 'one Commonwealth and under one Government' to be known as the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.
The ordinance was ratified by the Second Protectorate Parliament, as an Act of Union, on 26 June 1657.
One united Parliament sat in Westminster, with 30 representatives from Scotland and 30 from Ireland joining the existing members from England.
Whilst free trade was brought about amongst the new Commonwealth, the economic benefits were generally not felt as a result of heavy taxation used to fund  <START:person> Cromwell <END> 's New Model Army.
This republican union was dissolved automatically with the restoration of King  <START:person> Charles II <END>  to the thrones of England and Scotland.
Scottish members expelled from the Commonwealth Parliament petitioned unsuccessfully for a continuance of the union.
 <START:person> Cromwell <END> 's union had simultaneously raised interest in and suspicion of the concept of union and when  <START:person> Charles II <END>  attempted to recreate the union and fulfil the work of his grandfather in 1669, negotiations between Commissioners ground to a halt.
Later attempts.
An abortive scheme for union occurred in Scotland in 1670.
Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the records of the Parliament of Scotland show much discussion of possible union.
 <START:person> William <END>  and  <START:person> Mary <END> , whilst supportive of the idea, had no interest in allowing it to delay their enthronement.
Impetus for this incorporating union came almost entirely from King  <START:person> William <END> , who feared leaving Scotland open to a French invasion.
In the 1690s, the economic position of Scotland worsened, and relations between Scotland and England became strained.
In the following decade, however, union again became a significant topic of political debate.
Treaty and passage of the Acts of 1707.
Deeper political integration had been a key policy of Queen  <START:person> Anne <END>  from the time she acceded to the throne in 1702.
Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.
Both countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations.
Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials.
At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Seafield.
The English commissioners included the Lord High Treasurer, the Earl of Godolphin, the Lord Keeper,  <START:person> Baron Cowper <END> , and a large number of Whigs who supported union.
Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.
Negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the Cockpit in London.
Each side had its own particular concerns.
Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the Hanoverian dynasty would succeed  <START:person> Queen Anne <END>  to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.
After negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments.
In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the Parliament of Scotland were supportive of the Court Party.
For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the  <START:person> Squadrone Volante <END> , led by the Marquess of Montrose and the Duke of Roxburghe.
Opponents of the court were generally known as the Country party, and included various factions and individuals such as the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Belhaven and  <START:person> Andrew Fletcher <END>  of  <START:person> Saltoun <END> , who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union.
The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the Darien Disaster.
In Scotland, the Duke of Queensberry was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the Scottish Parliament.
In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action.
He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself.
In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road.
From Barnet, the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed.
On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at Kensington Palace.
Political motivations.
English perspective.
The English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne.
The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England.
The English succession was provided for by the English Act of Settlement 1701, which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the House of Hanover.
Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after Queen  <START:person> Anne <END> : the Scottish Act of Security 1704 granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation.
Many people in England were unhappy about the prospect, however.
English overseas possessions made England very wealthy in comparison to Scotland, a poor country with few roads, very little industry and almost no Navy.
This made some view unification as a markedly unequal relationship.
Scottish perspective.
In Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the Darien scheme through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the Alien Act to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.
The combined votes of the Court party with a majority of the  <START:person> Squadrone Volante <END>  were sufficient to ensure the final passage of the treaty through the House.
Personal financial interests were also allegedly involved.
Many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien Scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 15 granted £398,085 10s sterling to Scotland, a sum known as The Equivalent, to offset future liability towards the English national debt.
In essence it was also used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien Scheme, as 58.6% was allocated to its shareholders and creditors.
Even more direct bribery was also said to be a factor.
£20,000 (£240,000 Scots) was dispatched to Scotland for distribution by the Earl of Glasgow.
 <START:person> James Douglas <END> , 2nd  <START:person> Duke of Queensberry <END> , the Queen's Commissioner in Parliament, received £12,325, more than 60% of the funding.
(Some contend that all of this money was properly accounted for as compensation for loss of office, pensions and so forth not outwith the usual run of government.
It is perhaps a debate that will never be set to rest.
However, modern research has shown that payments were made to supporters of union that appear not to have been overdue salaries.
At least four payments were made to people who were not even members of the Scottish Parliament.)
 <START:person> Robert Burns <END>  referred to this: <poem>We're bought and sold for English Gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.</poem>
Some of the money was used to hire spies, such as  <START:person> Daniel Defoe <END> ; his first reports were of vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union.
"A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind," he reported, "for every Scot in favour there is 99 against".
Years later Sir  <START:person> John Clerk of Penicuik <END> , originally a leading Unionist, wrote in his memoirs that, ( <START:person> Defoe <END> ) was a spy among us, but not known as such, otherwise the Mob of Edinburgh would pull him to pieces.
 <START:person> Defoe <END>  recalls that he was hired by  <START:person> Robert Harley <END> .
The Treaty could be considered unpopular in Scotland: Sir  <START:person> George Lockhart <END>  of Carnwath, the only member of the Scottish negotiating team against union, noted that "The whole nation appears against the Union" and even Sir  <START:person> John Clerk of Penicuik <END> , an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was "contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom".
Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes.
The Convention of Royal Burghs also petitioned against the Union as proposed: That it is our indispensable duty to signify to your grace that, as we are not against an honourable and safe union with England far less can we expect to have the condition of the people of Scotland, with relation to these great concerns, made better and improved without a Scots Parliament.
Not one petition in favour of an incorporating union was received by Parliament.
On the day the treaty was signed, the carilloner in St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune "Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?" Threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing martial law.
Irish perspective.
Ireland, the third of the "sister kingdoms", was not included in the union.
The effective government of Ireland was in the hands of the 'Protestant Ascendancy', a minority elite (about 10% of the population).
The Roman Catholic majority were systematically excluded from political and military discourse through a series of post-Cromwellian Penal Laws, limiting their rights to property, education, and the franchise.
In July 1707 each House of the Parliament of Ireland passed a congratulatory address to  <START:person> Queen Anne <END> , praying that "May God put it in your royal heart to add greater strength and lustre to your crown, by a still more comprehensive Union".
The British government did not respond to the invitation and an equal union between Great Britain and Ireland was out of consideration until the 1790s.
Ireland's benefits from the Union of 1707 were therefore few.
Its preferential status in trade with England now extended to Scotland.
However, Ireland was left unequal and unrepresented in the Parliament of Great Britain.
The Kingdom of Ireland was to remain separate, and legally subordinate to Great Britain until 1784.
The union with Ireland finally came about on 1 January 1801.
Provisions of the Acts.
The Treaty of Union, agreed between representatives of the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature.
In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees.
Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706.
To minimise the opposition of the Church of Scotland, an Act was also passed to secure the Presbyterian establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy.
The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.
The two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send representative peers from the Peerage of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords.
It guaranteed that the Church of Scotland would remain the established church in Scotland, that the Court of Session would "remain in all time coming within Scotland", and that Scots law would "remain in the same force as before".
Other provisions included the restatement of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the ban on Roman Catholics from taking the throne.
It also created a customs union and monetary union.
The Act provided that any "laws and statutes" that were "contrary to or inconsistent with the terms" of the Act would "cease and become void."
Soon after the Union, the Act 6  <START:person> Anne <END>  c.40 (later infelicitously named the Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707) united the English and Scottish Privy Councils and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration.
In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the College of Justice.
Criticisms.
The English and Scottish parliaments had evolved along different lines; especially, the Parliament of Scotland had been unicameral while that of England had been bicameral.
Following Union, the parliament at Westminster followed the English model.
 <START:person> Defoe <END>  drew upon his Scottish experience to write his "Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Britain", published in 1726, where he admitted that the increase of trade and population in Scotland, which he had predicted as a consequence of the Union, was "not the case, but rather the contrary".
However, by the time  <START:person> Samuel Johnson <END>  and  <START:person> James Boswell <END>  made their tour in 1773, recorded in "A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland",  <START:person> Johnson <END>  noted that Scotland was "a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing" and in particular that Glasgow had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.
300th anniversary.
A commemorative two-pound coin was issued to mark the tercentennial—300th anniversary—of the Union, which occurred two days before the Scottish Parliament general election on 3 May 2007.
The Scottish Executive held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the National Museums of Scotland and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the National Galleries of Scotland.
Scottish voting records.
<noinclude>   <START:person> Arthur Jensen  Arthur Robert Jensen <END>  (August 24, 1923 – October 22, 2012) was a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was known for his work in psychometrics and differential psychology, which is concerned with how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.
He was a major proponent of the hereditarian position in the nature and nurture debate, the position that genetics play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as intelligence and personality.
He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals and sat on the editorial boards of the scientific journals "Intelligence" and "Personality and Individual Differences".
He was rated as one of the 50 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century.
He was also a controversial figure, largely for his conclusions regarding the causes of race-based differences in intelligence.
Early life.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was born August 24, 1923, in San Diego, California, the son of  <START:person> Linda Mary <END>  (née Schachtmayer) and  <START:person> Arthur Alfred Jensen <END> , who operated and owned a lumber and building materials company.
His paternal grandparents were Danish immigrants and his mother was of half Polish Jewish and half German descent.
He studied at University of California, Berkeley (B.A. 1945), San Diego State College (M.A., 1952) and Columbia University (Ph.D., 1956), and did his doctoral thesis with  <START:person> Percival Symonds <END>  on the Thematic Apperception Test: He published this work.
From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the University of London, Institute of Psychiatry with  <START:person> Hans Eysenck <END> .
Upon returning to the United States, he became a researcher and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of culture, development, and genetics on intelligence and learning.
He received tenure at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first sabbatical in 1964.
He has concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students.
In 2003, he was awarded the Kistler Prize for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human genome and human society.
In 2006, the International Society for Intelligence Research awarded  <START:person> Jensen <END>  its Lifetime Achievement Award.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  has had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a conductor himself.
At 14, he conducted a band that won a nationwide contest held in San Francisco.
Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a seminar given by  <START:person> Nikolai Sokoloff <END> .
Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to New York, mainly to be near the conductor  <START:person> Arturo Toscanini <END> .
He was also deeply interested in the life and example of  <START:person> Gandhi <END> , producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life.
During  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's period in San Diego he spent time working as a social worker with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.
IQ and academic achievement.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children.
The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability.
"Level I", or associative learning, may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills.
"Level II", or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.
Later,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the general factor of intelligence, a concept which was essentially synonymous with his "Level II" conceptual learning.
The general factor, or "g", is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  claimed, on the basis of his research, that general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait, determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions.
He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.
He suggested that from the data one might conclude that, on average, European Americans are more intelligent than African Americans.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the "Harvard Educational Review", was titled "How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?"
It concluded, among other things, that Head Start programs designed to boost African-American IQ scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.
The work became one of—if not the most—cited papers in the history of psychological testing and intelligence research.
After the paper was released, students and faculty staged large protests outside  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's U.C. Berkeley office.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  was denied reprints of his work by his publisher and was not permitted to reply in response to letters of criticism—both extremely unusual policies for their day.
In a later article,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  argued that his claims had been misunderstood: ...nowhere have I "claimed" an "innate deficiency" of intelligence in blacks.
My position on this question is clearly spelled out in my most recent book: "The plain fact is that at present there exists no scientifically satisfactory explanation for the differences between the IQ distributions in the black and white populations.
The only genuine consensus among well-informed scientists on this topic is that the cause of the difference remains an open question."
( <START:person> Jensen <END> , 1981a, p. 213).
 <START:person> Thomas Sowell <END>  wrote: Professor  <START:person> Jensen <END>  pointed out back in 1969 that black children's IQ scores rose by 8 to 10 points after he met with them informally in a play room and then tested them again after they were more relaxed around him.
He did this because "I felt these children were really brighter than their IQ would indicate."
What a shame that others seem to have less confidence in black children than Professor  <START:person> Jensen <END>  has had.
However,  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's 1998 "" gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ.
In Chapter 12: Population Differences in "g": Causal Hypotheses,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  writes: The relationship of the g factor to a number of biological variables and its relationship to the size of the white-black differences on various cognitive tests (i.e.,  <START:person> Spearman <END> 's hypothesis) suggests that the average white-black difference in "g" has a biological component.
Human races are viewed not as discrete, or Platonic, categories, but rather as breeding populations that, as a result of natural selection, have come to differ statistically in the relative frequencies of many polymorphic genes.
The genetic distances between various populations form a continuous variable that can be measured in terms of differences in gene frequencies.
Racial populations differ in many genetic characteristics, some of which, such as brain size, have behavioral and psychometric correlates, particularly "g".
In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on "Mainstream Science on Intelligence, " an editorial written by  <START:person> Linda Gottfredson <END>  and published in the "Wall Street Journal", which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the meaning and significance of IQ following the publication of the book "The Bell Curve".
In 2005,  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's article, co-written with  <START:person> J. Philippe Rushton <END> , named "Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability", was published in the APA journal "Psychology, Public Policy and Law".
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  and  <START:person> Rushton <END>  present ten categories of evidence in support of the notion that IQ differences between whites and blacks are partly genetic in origin.
Death.
He died on October 22, 2012 at his home in Kelseyville, California at age 89.
Criticism.
 <START:person> Melvin Konner <END>  wrote in the notes to his book "The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit": Statements made by  <START:person> Arthur Jensen <END> ,  <START:person> William Shockley <END> , and other investigators in the late 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions.
Many of these statements were proved wrong, but they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence is very difficult to recant.
Many studies that purport to be both science-based and attempt to influence public policy have been accused of scientific racism.
 <START:person> Konner <END>  wrote: What of the latest currents of thought?
Are they likely to lead to, or at least encourage, further distortions of social policy?
The indications are not all encouraging.
 <START:person> Richard Herrnstein <END>  and  <START:person> Charles Murray <END>  published a book in 1994 clearly directed at policy, just as  <START:person> Jensen <END>  and others had in the 1960s and 1970s.
"The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life" (New York: Free Press 1994) teamed a psychologist with a conservative policy advocate to try to prove that both the class structure and the racial divide in the United States result from genetically determined differences in intelligence and ability.
Their general assertions about genes and IQ were not very controversial, but their speculations on race were something else again.
By 1994, the time of The Bell Curve's publishing,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  had received $1.1 million from the Pioneer Fund, an organization frequently described as racist and "white supremacist" in nature.
The fund contributed a total of $3.5 million to researchers cited in The Bell Curve's most controversial chapter "that suggests some races are naturally smarter than others" with  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's works being cited twenty-three times in the book's bibliography.
 <START:person> Lisa Suzuki <END>  and  <START:person> Joshua Aronson <END>  of New York University claimed in 2005 that  <START:person> Jensen <END>  has largely ignored evidence that fails to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent a genetic racial hierarchy unwaveringly for over 30 years.
Paleontologist and evolutionary biologist  <START:person> Stephen Jay Gould <END>  attacked  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's work in his 1981 book "The Mismeasure of Man".
 <START:person> Gould <END>  writes that  <START:person> Jensen <END>  misapplies the concept of "heritability", which is defined as a measure of the variation of a trait due to inheritance "within" a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156-157).
According to  <START:person> Gould <END> ,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  uses heritability to measure differences "between" populations.
 <START:person> Gould <END>  also disagrees with  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, "g", or "the general factor common to a large number of cognitive abilities" which can be measured along a unilinear scale.
This is a claim most closely identified with  <START:person> Charles Spearman <END> .
According to  <START:person> Gould <END> ,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  misunderstood the research of  <START:person> L. L. Thurstone <END>  to ultimately support this claim;  <START:person> Gould <END> , however, argues that  <START:person> Thurstone <END> 's factor analysis of intelligence revealed "g" to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314).
 <START:person> Gould <END>  criticizes  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's sources including his use of  <START:person> Catharine Cox <END> 's 1926 "Genetic Studies of Genius", which examines historiometrically the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths ( <START:person> Gould <END>  1981: 153-154).
In 1980  <START:person> Jensen <END>  published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled "Bias in Mental Testing".
Reviewing this book, psychologist  <START:person> Kenneth Kaye <END>  endorsed  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's distinction between bias and discrimination.
The purpose of tests is to discriminate (that is, reveal actual differences) on the basis of ability; bias constitutes error.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  defined any test as biased for a particular group if that group differs significantly from the majority group in the slopes, intercepts, or standard error of the estimates of their regression lines.
Most studies found no difference in the regression lines between black and white groups, but those differences that had been found to be biased had overpredicted rather than underpredicted the minority group's performance (for example, grades in Officer Candidate courses).
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's conclusion: Until we find out what the relevant psychological predictors are for which racial classification per se is merely a 'stand-in' variable, we have no choice but to include race (or other group membership) as a predictive variable along with the test scores or other predictive measures.
On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.
Pointing out that "many of  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's opponents allowed their scientific conclusions to be far more biased by their political views than he did,  <START:person> Kaye <END>  quoted 18th-century  <START:person> David Hume <END> : "There is no Method of Reasoning more Common, and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical Debates, to endeavor the Refutation of any Hypothesis, by a Pretext of its dangerous Consequences to Religion and Morality."
In a 1982 review of "The Mismeasure of Man",  <START:person> Jensen <END>  gives point-by-point rebuttals to much of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's critique, including  <START:person> Gould <END> 's treatment of heritability, the "reification" of "g", and the use of Thurstone's analysis.
 <START:person> Gould <END>  responded to  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's rebuttals in a revised edition of the book, published in 1996.
 <START:person> Jensen <END> 's response and criticism.
In  <START:person> Arthur Jensen <END> 's response to  <START:person> Gould <END> 's criticisms, in the paper titled "The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons".,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  begins his paper with this observation  <START:person> Stephen Jay Gould <END>  is a paleontologist at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and offers a course at Harvard entitled, "Biology as a Social Weapon."
Apparently the course covers much the same content as does the present book.
Having had some personal cause for interest in ideologically motivated attacks on biologically oriented behavioral scientists, I first took notice of  <START:person> Gould <END>  when he played a prominent role in a group called Science for the People and in that group's attack on the theories of Harvard zoologist  <START:person> Edward O. Wilson <END> , a leader in the development of sociobiology...
While  <START:person> Jensen <END>  recognizes the validity of some of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's claims, in many places, he criticizes  <START:person> Gould <END> 's general approach This charge of a social, value-laden science undoubtedly contains an element of truth.
In recent years, however, we recognize this charge as the keystone of the Marxist interpretation of the history of science.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  adds that  <START:person> Gould <END>  made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present  <START:person> Jensen <END> 's own positions In his references to my own work,  <START:person> Gould <END>  includes at least nine citations that involve more than just an expression of  <START:person> Gould <END> 's opinion; in these citations  <START:person> Gould <END>  purportedly paraphrases my views.
Yet in eight of the nine cases,  <START:person> Gould <END> 's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured.
Nonspecialists could have no way of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources.
While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears  <START:person> Gould <END> 's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.
 <START:person> Jensen <END>  expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner,  <START:person> James R. Flynn <END> : Now and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue?
The name  <START:person> James R. Flynn <END>  is by far the first that comes to mind.
His book, "Race, IQ and  <START:person> Jensen <END> " (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.
Books.
The "g" Factor.
"" (1998) is a book on the general intelligence factor ("g").
The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.
Clocking the Mind.
"Clocking the Mind : Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences" (2006) deals with mental chronometry (MC), and covers a variety of techniques for measuring the speed with which the brain processes information.
Whereas IQ merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties,  <START:person> Jensen <END>  argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability.
Amyl nitrite  Amyl nitrite is the chemical compound with the formula C5H11ONO.
A variety of isomers are known, but they all feature an amyl group attached to the nitrite functional group.
The alkyl group is unreactive and the chemical and biological properties are mainly due to the nitrite group.
Like other alkyl nitrites, amyl nitrite is bioactive in mammals, being a vasodilator, which is the basis of its use as a prescription medicine.
As an inhalant, it also has a psychoactive effect, which has led to its recreational use.
Nomenclature.
The term "amyl nitrite" encompasses several isomers.
For example, a common form of amyl nitrite with the formula (CH3)2CHCH2CH2ONO may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite.
When the amyl group is a linear or normal (n) alkyl group, the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH3(CH2)4ONO.
Despite a very similar name to amyl nitrite, amyl nitrate has a different chemical composition and different properties.
Synthesis and reactions.
Alkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of alcohols with nitrous acid: The reaction is called esterification.
Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories.
A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol.
The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrous and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily decanted from the reaction mixture.
Isoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the isoamyl alcohol: Amyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with carbanions to give oximes.
Amyl nitrites are also useful as reagents in a modification of the  <START:person> Sandmeyer <END>  reaction.
The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic amine in a halogenated solvent produces a radical aromatic species, this then abstracts a halogen atom from the solvent.
For the synthesis of aryl iodides diiodomethane is used, whereas bromoform is the solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl bromides.
Physiological effects.
Amyl nitrite, in common with other alkyl nitrites, is a potent vasodilator; it expands blood vessels, resulting in lowering of the blood pressure.
Alkyl nitrites are a source of nitric oxide, which signals for relaxation of the involuntary muscles.
Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the blood vessel walls and the internal and external anal sphincter.
There are no withdrawal symptoms.
Overdose symptoms include nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypoventilation, shortness of breath, and fainting.
The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear within a few minutes.
Amyl nitrate may also intensify the experience of synesthesia.
Applications.
Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat heart diseases such as angina.
It is also used as an inhalant drug that induces a brief euphoric state, and when combined with other intoxicant stimulant drugs such as cocaine or ecstasy (see MDMA), the euphoric state intensifies and is prolonged.
Once some stimulative drugs wear off, a common side effect is a period of depression or anxiety, colloquially called a "come down"; amyl nitrite is sometimes used to combat these negative after-effects.
This effect, combined with its dissociative effects, has led to its use as a recreational drug (see poppers).
Amyl nitrite is also sometimes used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning.
It can act as an oxidant, to induce the formation of methemoglobin.
Methemoglobin in turn can sequester cyanide as cyanomethemoglobin.
Alexandria Troas  Alexandria Troas ("Alexandria of the Troad"; Greek: Αλεξάνδρεια Τρωάς; Turkish: "Eski Stambul") is the site of an ancient Greek city situated on the Aegean Sea near the northern tip of Turkey's western coast, a little south of Tenedos (modern Bozcaada).
It is located southeast of modern Dalyan, a village in the Ezine district of Çanakkale Province.
The site sprawls over an estimated 400 ha; among the few structures remaining today are a ruined bath, an odeon, a theatre, gymnasium complex and a recently uncovered stadion.
The circuit of the old walls can still be traced.
History.
Hellenistic.
According to  <START:person> Strabo <END> , this site was first called Sigeia; around 306 BC Antigonus refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia, including the once influential city of Neandreia.
It did not receive its name until its name was changed by  <START:person> Lysimachus <END>  to Alexandria Troas, in 301 BC, in memory of  <START:person> Alexander III of Macedon <END>  ( <START:person> Pliny <END>  merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria).
As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a "free and autonomous city" as early as 188 BC, and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance.
In its heyday the city may have had a population of about 100,000.
 <START:person> Strabo <END>  mentions that a Roman colony was created at the location in the reign of Augustus, named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period).
 <START:person> Augustus <END> ,  <START:person> Hadrian <END>  and the rich grammarian  <START:person> Herodes Atticus <END>  contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter.
 <START:person> Constantine <END>  considered making Troas the capital of the Roman Empire.
Roman.
In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between Anatolia and Europe.
 <START:person> Paul <END>  of Tarsus sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of Eutychus later occurred).
 <START:person> Ignatius <END>  of Antioch also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.
Byzantine.
Several of its later bishops are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344;  <START:person> Sylvanus <END>  at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451;  <START:person> Leo <END>  in 787;  <START:person> Peter <END> , friend of the Patriarch  <START:person> Ignatius <END> , and adversary to  <START:person> Michael <END> , in the ninth century.
In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of Cyzicus and distinct from the famous Troy ( <START:person> Heinrich Gelzer <END> , "Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum", 552; "Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani", 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared.
The bishopric remains a titular see of the Catholic Church under the name Troas, vacant since 1971.
Troas is also a titular see of the Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
Bishop  <START:person> Savas <END>  ( <START:person> Zembillas <END> ) of  <START:person> Troas <END>  served as hierarch from 2002 to 2011, and then became Metropolitan  <START:person> Savas <END>  ( <START:person> Zembillas <END> ) of Pittsburgh in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.
Ottoman.
Karasid Turkomans settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century.
Their "beylik" was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336.
The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as " <START:person> Eski Stambul <END> ", the "Old City".
The site's stones were much plundered for building material (for example  <START:person> Mehmed IV <END>  took columns to adorn his Yeni Valide Mosque in Istanbul).
As of the mid-18th century the site served as "a lurking place for bandetti".
Modern.
By 1911, the site had been overgrown with vallonea oaks and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved.
They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals.
Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as "Bal Saray" (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by  <START:person> Herodes Atticus <END>  in the year 135.
 <START:person> Trajan <END>  built an aqueduct which can still be traced.
The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand.
It is the subject of an early twenty-first century study by German archaeologists digging and surveying at the site.
Their excavation uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100 BC.
Epsilon Ursae Majoris  Epsilon Ursae Majoris (Epsilon UMa, ε Ursae Majoris, ε UMa) is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Major (despite its Bayer designation being merely "epsilon"), and at magnitude 1.76 is the thirty-first brightest star in the sky.
It has the traditional name Alioth.
It is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body, and thus the star in the handle of the Big Dipper (Plough) closest to the bowl.
It is also a member of the large and diffuse Ursa Major moving group.
Historically, the star was frequently used in celestial navigation in the maritime trade, because it is listed as one of the 57 navigational stars.[1]
Peculiarities.
According to "Hipparcos",  <START:person> Alioth <END>  is 81 light years (25 parsecs) from Earth.
Its spectral type is A0p; the "p" stands for "peculiar", as the spectrum of its light is characteristic of an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable.
 <START:person> Alioth <END> , as a representative of this type, may harbor two interacting processes.
First, the star's strong magnetic field separating different elements in the star's hydrogen 'fuel'.
In addition, a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis may be spinning different bands of magnetically sorted elements into the line of sight between Alioth and the Earth.
The intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of light as they whip in and out of view, causing Alioth to have very strange spectral lines that fluctuate over a period of 5.1 days.
With  <START:person> Alioth <END> , the rotational and magnetic axes are at almost 90 degrees to one another.
Darker (denser) regions of chromium form a band at right angles to the equator.
A recent study suggests  <START:person> Alioth <END> 's 5.1-day variation may be due to a substellar object of about 14.7 Jupiter masses in an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) with an average separation of 0.055 astronomical units.
 <START:person> Alioth <END>  has a relatively weak magnetic field, 15 times weaker than α CVn, but it is still 100 times stronger than that of the Earth.
Namesakes.
USS Allioth (AK-109) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.
Arianespace  Arianespace SA is a European multinational company founded in 1980 as the world's first commercial launch service provider.
Seated in France, it undertakes the production, operation, and marketing of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle as part of the Ariane programme.
Two other launch systems are offered by the company, the Soyuz-2 as a medium-lift alternative to Ariane 5, and the Vega as a lighter one.
s of 2004[ [update]], Arianespace held more than 50 percent of the world market for boosting satellites to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).
More than 240 commercial launches have occurred since May 22, 1984, and Arianespace states that the total number of launch contracts signed since Ariane launches commenced operations in 1984 is 285.
Arianespace uses the Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guiana as a launch site.
It has its headquarters in Courcouronnes, Essonne, France, near Évry.
On 21 October 2011 Arianespace launched the first Soyuz rocket ever from outside former Soviet territory.
The payload was two Galileo navigation satellites.
The company and its infrastructure.
Arianespace primary shareholders are its suppliers, in the various nations of the European Union.
Arianespace currently has 21 shareholders: Competition and pricing.
The disruptive force represented in new sector entrant SpaceX, forced Arianespace to cut workforce, and focus on cost-cutting, to decrease costs to remain competitive against the new low-cost entrant in the launch sector.
According to one Arianespace managing director, ""It's quite clear there's a very significant challenge coming from SpaceX," he said.
"Therefore things have to change … and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined."
In the midst of pricing pressure from U.S. company SpaceX, Arianespace made a November 2013 announcement of pricing flexibility for the "lighter satellites" it carries to Geostationary orbits aboard its Ariane 5.
In early 2014, Arianespace requested additional subsidies from European governments to face the competition from SpaceX and unfavorable changes in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate.
Reducing pricing allowed Arianespace to sign four additional contracts in September 2014 for a lower slots on an Ariane 5 SYLDA dispenser for the satellites that otherwise could be flown on SpaceX launch vehicle.
Overall Arianespace signed 11 contracts in 2014 until September with two additional being in a late stage of negotiations.
s of September 2014[ [update]] Arianespace has a backlog of launches worth € billion with 38 satellites to be launched on Ariane 5, 7 on Soyuz and 9 on  <START:person> Vega <END> , claiming 60% of global satellite launch market.
By November 2014, SpaceX had "already begun to take market share" from Arianespace, and Eutelsat CEO  <START:person> Michel de Rosen <END> —a major customer of Arianespace—said that "Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through economies of scale."
Launch Vehicles.
Currently Arianespace operates 3 launch vehicles, including two versions of Ariane 5: Additionally Arianespace offers optional back-up launch service on H-IIA through Launch Services Alliance.
Ariane launch vehicles.
Since the first launch in 1979, there have been several versions of the Ariane launch vehicle:  Advanced Power Management  Advanced power management (APM) is an API developed by Intel and Microsoft and released in 1992 which enables an operating system running an IBM-compatible personal computer to work with the BIOS (part of the computer's firmware) to achieve power management.
Revision 1.2 was the last version of the APM specification, released in 1996.
ACPI is intended as the successor to APM.
Microsoft dropped support for APM in Windows Vista.
The Linux kernel still mostly supports APM, with the last fully functional APM support shipping in 3.3.
Overview.
APM uses a layered approach to manage devices.
APM-aware applications (which include device drivers) talk to an OS-specific APM driver.
This driver communicates to the APM-aware BIOS, which controls the hardware.
There is the ability to opt out of APM control on a device-by-device basis, which can be used if a driver wants to communicate directly with a hardware device.
Communication occurs both ways; power management events are sent from the BIOS to the APM driver, and the APM driver sends information and requests to the BIOS via function calls.
In this way the APM driver is an intermediary between the BIOS and the operating system.
Power management happens in two ways; through the above-mentioned function calls from the APM driver to the BIOS requesting power state changes, and automatically based on device activity.
Power management events.
There are 12 power events (such as standby, suspend and resume requests, and low battery notifications), plus OEM-defined events, that can be sent from the APM BIOS to the operating system.
The APM driver regularly polls for event change notifications.
Power Management Events: Power management functions: APM functions.
There are 21 APM function calls defined that the APM driver can use to query power management statuses, or request power state transitions.
Example function calls include letting the BIOS know about current CPU usage (the BIOS may respond to such a call by placing the CPU in a low-power state, or returning it to its full-power state), retrieving the current power state of a device, or requesting a power state change.
Power states.
The APM specification defines system power states and device power states.
System power states.
APM defines five power states for the computer system: Device power states.
APM also defines power states that APM-aware hardware can implement.
There is no requirement that an APM-aware device implement all states.
The four states are: CPU.
The CPU core (defined in APM as the CPU clock, cache, system bus and system timers) is treated specially in APM, as it is the last device to be powered down, and the first device to be powered back up.
The CPU core is always controlled through the APM BIOS (there is no option to control it through a driver).
Drivers can use APM function calls to notify the BIOS about CPU usage, but it is up to the BIOS to act on this information; a driver cannot directly tell the CPU to go into a power saving state.
