First RB B-ADVP 
, , O 
its PRP$ B-NP 
position NN I-NP 
in IN O 
the DT O 
government NN B-NP 
is VBZ B-VP 
anomalous JJ B-ADJP

It PRP B-NP

an DT O 
unusual JJ B-NP 
kind NN I-NP 
of IN O

the DT O

Thus RB B-ADVP 
we PRP B-NP 
have VBP B-VP 
a DT O 
condition NN B-NP 
that WDT B-NP 
is VBZ B-VP 
easily RB I-VP 
described VBN I-VP

undemocratic JJ B-ADJP

Second JJ B-ADVP 
, , O 
the DT O 
responsibilities NNS B-NP

as IN O

of IN O 
the DT O 
stability NN B-NP 
of IN O 
the DT O 
price NN B-NP 
level NN I-NP 
, , O 
sometimes RB B-ADVP 
lead VB B-VP 
it PRP B-NP 
to TO B-VP 
take VB I-VP 
measures NNS B-NP 
that WDT B-NP 
are VBP B-VP 
unpopular JJ B-ADJP

As IN B-SBAR 
former JJ B-NP
