Bernanke began his career at the
Stanford Graduate School of Business in
1979. In 1985 he moved to Princeton
University, where he served as chair of
the Economics Department from 1995 to
2002. He has twice been visiting
professor at M.I.T. and once at New
York University, and has taught in
undergraduate, M.B.A., M.P.A., and
Ph.D. programs. He has authored more
than 60 publications in macroeconom-
ics, macroeconomic history, and ﬁnance.
Bernanke has served as a visiting
scholar and advisor to the Federal
Reserve System. He is a Guggenheim
Fellow and a Fellow of the Econometric
Society. He has also been variously hon-
ored as an Alfred P. Sloan Research
Fellow, a Hoover Institution National

of his research in recent years has been
on forecasting and how data revisions
affect monetary policy, forecasting, and
macroeconomic research. Croushore’s

S
ince February 2006, Ben Bernanke has been chairman of the Board of Gover-
nors of the Federal Reserve System. Federal ethics rules prohibited him from
making substantive contributions to the sixth and seventh editions.
In preparing the seventh edition, we viewed our main objective to be keeping
the book fresh and up-to-date, especially in light of the recent crises in housing and
ﬁnancial markets and their impact on the macroeonomy. Thus, we have also added
new applications, boxes, and problems throughout and made many revisions of the
text to reﬂect recent events and developments in the ﬁeld. In addition, the empiri-
cal problems at the end of most chapters direct students to appropriate data in the
FRED database on the Web site of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Because
this database is frequently updated and is available free of charge, students will
develop familiarity and facility with a current data source that they can continue to
use after completing the course.
A summary of our revisions follows.
New and Updated Coverage
What is taught in intermediate macroeconomics courses—and how it is taught—has
changed substantially in recent years. Previous editions of Macroeconomics played a
major role in these developments. The seventh edition provides lively coverage of a
broad spectrum of macroeconomic issues and ideas, including a variety of new and
updated topics:
■ Monetary policy. In response to the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, the Federal Reserve
introduced new tools to prop up the ﬁnancial system and to inﬂuence eco-
nomic activity, so we have added a substantial amount of material to discuss
many different aspects of these policy changes. In addition, because most
central banks now rely primarily on targeting interest rates, we derive a new
(horizontal) curve (the LR curve) in place of the LM curve and show how to
use this modiﬁed IS–LM model to analyze monetary policy in the context of
interest-rate targeting. These two major changes have led us to rewrite
Chapter 14 on monetary policy substantially. New or substantially revised
coverage: In Chapter 14 we now discuss the money multiplier during severe
ﬁnancial crises, comparing the money supply during the Great Depression to
that from 2007–2009, illustrate the changes in the Federal Reserve’s balance
sheet during the recent ﬁnancial crisis, describe the Federal Reserve’s pay-
ment of interest on reserves, and expand our analysis of both the Taylor rule
and inﬂation targeting.
■ Long-term economic growth. Because the rate of economic growth plays a central
role in determining living standards, we devote much of Part 2 to growth and
related issues. We ﬁrst discuss factors contributing to growth, such as productiv-
ity (Chapter 3) and rates of saving and investment (Chapter 4); then in Chapter 6
we turn to a full-ﬂedged analysis of the growth process, using tools such as
xv
Preface
A01_ABEL4529_07_SE_FM.QXD  12/11/09  3:35 AM  Page xv
growth accounting and the Solow model. Growth-related topics covered include
the post-1973 productivity slowdown, the factors that determine long-run living
standards, and the productivity “miracle” of the 1990s. Revised coverage: Updated
data and a discussion of the recent growth of China’s economy.
■ International macroeconomic issues. We address the increasing integration of the
world economy in two ways. First, we frequently use cross-country compar-
isons and applications that draw on the experiences of nations other than the
United States. For example, in Chapter 3, we compare U.S. and European labor
markets; in Chapter 6 we compare the long-term economic growth rates of
several countries; in Chapter 7 we compare inﬂation experiences among Euro-
pean countries in transition; in Chapter 8 we compare the growth in industri-
al production in several countries; in Chapter 12 we compare sacriﬁce ratios
among various countries; and in Chapter 14 we discuss strategies used for
making monetary policy around the world. Second, we devote two chapters, 5
and 13, speciﬁcally to international issues. In Chapter 5 we show how the
trade balance is related to a nation’s rates of saving and investment, and then
apply this framework to discuss issues such as the U.S. trade deficit and
the relationship between government budget deﬁcits and trade deﬁcits. In
Chapter 13 we use a simple supply–demand framework to examine the deter-
mination of exchange rates. The chapter features innovative material on ﬁxed
exchange rates and currency unions, including an explanation of why a cur-
rency may face a speculative run. Revised coverage: The text includes updated
data comparing U.S. and European labor markets (Chapter 3) and a discussion
of the impact of globalization on the U.S. economy (Chapter 5).
■ Business cycles. Our analysis of business cycles begins with facts rather than
theories. In Chapter 8 we give a history of U.S. business cycles and then describe
the observed cyclical behavior of a variety of important economic variables
(the “business cycle facts”). In Chapters 9–11 we evaluate alternative classical
and Keynesian theories of the cycle by how well they explain the facts. New to
this edition: The text now includes a description of the Fed’s preferred inﬂation
measures (Chapter 2), contains a discussion of the housing crisis that began in
2007 (Chapter 7), shows how the rate of job loss and job ﬁnding vary across the
business cycle (Chapter 8), and presents new coincident indexes (Chapter 8).
■ Fiscal policy. The effects of macroeconomic policies are considered in nearly every
chapter, in both theory and applications. We present classical (Chapter 10), Key-
nesian (Chapter 11), and monetarist (Chapter 14) views on the appropriate use of
policy. New or substantially revised coverage: The text now discusses evidence on
how consumers respond to tax rebates (Chapter 2) and a description of the ﬁscal
stimulus package of 2009 and its impact on the debt–GDP ratio (Chapter 15).
■ Labor market issues. We pay close attention to issues relating to employment,
unemployment, and real wages. We introduce the basic supply–demand model
of the labor market, as well as unemployment, early, in Chapter 3. We discuss
unemployment more extensively in Chapter 12, which covers the inﬂation–
unemployment trade-off, the costs of unemployment, and government policies
for reducing unemployment. Other labor market topics include household pro-
duction and how it affects the business cycle (Chapter 10), efﬁciency wages
(Chapter 11), and the effects of marginal and average tax rate changes on labor
supply (Chapter 15). New or substantially revised coverage: The text now discusses
xvi Preface
A01_ABEL4529_07_SE_FM.QXD  12/11/09  3:35 AM  Page xvi
in greater detail the degree to which jobs are lost and gained over the course of
the business cycle, showing data based on recent research.
A Solid Foundation
The seventh edition builds on the strengths that underlie the book's lasting appeal
to instructors and students, including:
■ Real-world applications. A perennial challenge for instructors is to help students
make active use of the economic ideas developed in the text. The rich variety of
applications in this book shows by example how economic concepts can be put
to work in explaining real-world issues such as the housing crisis that began in
2007 and the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, the contrasting behavior of unemployment
in the United States and Europe, the slowdown and revival in productivity
growth, the challenges facing the Social Security system and the Federal
budget, the impact of globalization on the U.S. economy, and new approaches
to making monetary policy that were used in response to the ﬁnancial crisis in
2008. The seventh edition offers new applications as well as updates of the best
applications and analyses of previous editions.
■ Broad modern coverage. From its conception, Macroeconomics has responded to
students’ desires to investigate and understand a wider range of macroeco-
nomic issues than is permitted by the course’s traditional emphasis on short-
run fluctuations and stabilization policy. This book provides a modern
treatment of these traditional topics but also gives in-depth coverage of other
important macroeconomic issues such as the determinants of long-run eco-
nomic growth, the trade balance and ﬁnancial ﬂows, labor markets, and the
institutional framework of policymaking. This comprehensive coverage also
makes the book a useful tool for instructors with differing views about course
coverage and topic sequence.
■ Reliance on a set of core economic ideas. Although we cover a wide range of topics,
we avoid developing a new model or theory for each issue. Instead we empha-
size the broad applicability of a set of core economic ideas (such as the pro-
duction function, the trade-off between consuming today and saving for
tomorrow, and supply–demand analysis). Using these core ideas, we build a
theoretical framework that encompasses all the macroeconomic analyses pre-
sented in the book: long-run and short-run, open-economy and closed-econo-
my, and classical and Keynesian.
■ A balanced presentation. Macroeconomics is full of controversies, many of which
arise from the split between classicals and Keynesians (of the old, new, and
neo-varieties). Sometimes the controversies overshadow the broad common
ground shared by the two schools. We emphasize that common ground. First,
we pay greater attention to long-run issues (on which classicals and Keynesians
have less disagreement). Second, we develop the classical and Keynesian
analyses of short-run ﬂuctuations within a single overall framework, in which
we show that the two approaches differ principally in their assumptions about
how quickly wages and prices adjust. Where differences in viewpoint remain—
for example, in the search versus efficiency-wage interpretations of
unemployment—we present and critique both perspectives. This balanced
approach exposes students to all the best ideas in modern macroeconomics. At
Preface xvii
A01_ABEL4529_07_SE_FM.QXD  12/11/09  3:35 AM  Page xvii
the same time, an instructor of either classical or Keynesian inclination can
easily base a course on this book.
■ Innovative pedagogy. The seventh edition, like its predecessors, provides a vari-
ety of useful tools to help students study, understand, and retain the material.
Described in more detail later in the preface, these tools include summary
tables, key diagrams, key terms, and key equations to aid students in organiz-
ing their study, and four types of questions and problems for practice and
developing understanding, including problems that encourage students to do
their own empirical work, using data readily available on the Internet. Several
appendices illustrate how to solve numerical exercises that are based on the
algebraic descriptions of the IS-LM/AS-AD model.
A Flexible Organization
The seventh edition maintains the ﬂexible structure of earlier editions. In Part 1
(Chapters 1–2), we introduce the ﬁeld of macroeconomics and discuss issues of eco-
nomic measurement. In Part 2 (Chapters 3–7), we focus on long-run issues, includ-
ing productivity, saving, investment, the trade balance, growth, and inﬂation. We
devote Part 3 (Chapters 8–11) to the study of short-run economic ﬂuctuations and
stabilization policy. Finally, in Part 4 (Chapters 12–15), we take a closer look at
issues and institutions of policymaking. Appendix A at the end of the book reviews
useful algebraic and graphical tools.
Instructors of intermediate macroeconomics have different preferences as to
course content, and their choices are often constrained by their students’ back-
grounds and the length of the term. The structure of Macroeconomics accommodates
various needs. In planning how to use the book, instructors might ﬁnd it useful to
consider the following points:
■ Core chapters. We recommend that every course include these six chapters:
Chapter 1 Introduction to Macroeconomics
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy
Chapter 3 Productivity, Output, and Employment
Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment
Chapter 7 The Asset Market, Money, and Prices
Chapter 9 The IS–LM/AD–AS Model: A General Framework for Macroeco-
nomic Analysis
Chapters 1 and 2 provide an introduction to macroeconomics, including
national income accounting. The next four chapters in the list make up the ana-
lytical core of the book: Chapter 3 examines the labor market, Chapters 3 and
4 together develop the goods market, Chapter 7 discusses the asset market, and
Chapter 9 combines the three markets into a general equilibrium model usable
for short-run analysis (in either a classical or Keynesian mode).
■ Suggested additions. To a syllabus containing these six chapters, instructors can
add various combinations of the other chapters, depending on the course
focus. The following are some possible choices:
Short-run focus. Instructors who prefer to emphasize short-run issues (busi-
ness cycle ﬂuctuations and stabilization policy) may omit Chapters 5 and
6 without loss of continuity. They could also go directly from Chapters 1
xviii Preface
A01_ABEL4529_07_SE_FM.QXD  12/11/09  3:35 AM  Page xviii
and 2 to Chapters 8 and 9, which introduce business cycles and the
IS–LM/AD–AS framework. Although the presentation in Chapters 8 and 9
is self-contained, it will be helpful for instructors who skip Chapters 3–7 to
provide some background and motivation for the various behavioral rela-
tionships and equilibrium conditions.
Classical emphasis. For instructors who want to teach the course with a
modern classical emphasis, we recommend assigning all the chapters in
Part 2. In Part 3, Chapters 8–10 provide a self-contained presentation of
classical business cycle theory. Other material of interest includes the Fried-
man–Phelps interpretation of the Phillips curve (Chapter 12), the role of
credibility in monetary policy (Chapter 14), and Ricardian equivalence
with multiple generations (Chapter 15).
Keynesian emphasis. Instructors who prefer a Keynesian emphasis may
choose to omit Chapter 10 (classical business cycle analysis). As noted, if a
short-run focus is preferred, Chapter 5 (full-employment analysis of the
open economy) and Chapter 6 (long-run economic growth) may also be
omitted without loss of continuity.
International focus. Chapter 5 discusses saving, investment, and the trade
balance in an open economy with full employment. Chapter 13 considers
exchange rate determination and macroeconomic policy in an open-econo-
my model in which short-run deviations from full employment are possi-
ble. (Chapter 5 is a useful but not essential prerequisite for Chapter 13.) Both
chapters may be omitted for a course focusing on the domestic economy.
Applying Macroeconomics to the Real World
Economists sometimes get caught up in the elegance of formal models and forget that
the ultimate test of a model or theory is its practical relevance. In the previous edi-
tions of Macroeconomics, we dedicated a signiﬁcant portion of each chapter to show-
ing how the theory could be applied to real events and issues. Our efforts were well
received by instructors and students. The seventh edition continues to help students
learn how to “think like an economist” by including the following features:
■ Applications. Applications in each chapter show students how they can use
theory to understand an important episode or issue. Examples of topics covered
in Applications include the macroeconomic consequences of the boom and bust
in stock prices (Chapter 4), how people respond to tax rebates (Chapter 4), the
United States as international debtor (Chapter 5), the recent surge in U.S. pro-
ductivity growth (Chapter 6), calibrating the business cycle (Chapter 10), how
the introduction of euro currency affected exchange rates (Chapter 13), inﬂation
targeting (Chapter 14), and labor supply and tax reform (Chapter 15).
■ In Touch with Data and Research. These boxes give the reader further insight into
new developments in economic research as well as a guide to keeping abreast of
new developments in the economy . Research topics in these boxes include discus-
sions of biases in inﬂation measurement (Chapter 2), the link between capital
investment and the stock market (Chapter 4), ﬂows of U.S. dollars abroad (Chapter
7), DSGE models and the classical–Keynesian debate (Chapter 10), the Lucas cri-
tique (Chapter 12), and the ﬁscal stimulus package passed in 2009 (Chapter 15).
Keeping abreast of the economy requires an understanding of what data are
Preface xix
A01_ABEL4529_07_SE_FM.QXD  12/11/09  3:35 AM  Page xix
available, as well as their strengths and shortcomings. We provide a series of
boxes to show where to ﬁnd key macroeconomic data—such as labor market
data (Chapter 3), balance of payments data (Chapter 5), and exchange rates
(Chapter 13)—and how to interpret them. Online data sources are featured
along with more traditional media.
Learning Features
The following features of this book aim to help students understand, apply, and
retain important concepts:
■ Detailed, full-color graphs. The book is liberally illustrated with data graphs,
which emphasize the empirical relevance of the theory, and analytical graphs,
which guide students through the development of model and theory in a step-
by-step manner. For both types of graphs, descriptive captions summarize the
details of the events shown.
■ The use of color in an analytical graph is demonstrated by the ﬁgure on the next
page, which shows the effects of a shifting curve on a set of endogenous vari-
ables. Note that the original curve is in black, whereas its new position is
marked in red, with the direction of the shift indicated by arrows. A peach-
colored “shock box” points out the reason for the shift, and a blue “result box”
lists the main effects of the shock on endogenous variables. These and similar con-
ventions make it easy for students to gain a clear understanding of the analysis.
■ Key diagrams. Key diagrams, a unique study feature at the end of selected chap-
ters, are self-contained descriptions of the most important analytical graphs in
the book (see the end of the Detailed Contents for a list). For each key diagram,
we present the graph (for example, the production function, p. 95, or the
AD–AS diagram, p. 346) and deﬁne and describe its elements in words and,
where appropriate, equations. We then analyze what the graph reveals and dis-
cuss the factors that shift the curves in the graph.
■ Summary tables. Throughout the book, summary tables bring together the main
results of an analysis and reduce the time that students must spend writing and
memorizing results, allowing a greater concentration on understanding and
applying these results.
■ End-of-chapter review materials. To facilitate review, at the end of each chapter
students will ﬁnd a chapter summary, covering the chapter’s main points; a list
of key terms with page references; and an annotated list of key equations.
■ End-of-chapter questions and problems. An extensive set of questions and problems
includes review questions, for student self-testing and study; numerical problems,
which have numerical solutions and are especially useful for checking students’
understanding of basic relationships and concepts; analytical problems, which ask
students to use or extend a theory qualitatively; and empirical problems that
direct students to use data from the FRED database of the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis and allow them to see for themselves how well theory explains real-
world data. Answers to these problems (except the empirical problems, the
answers to which change over time) appear in the Instructor’s Manual. All end-of-
chapter Review Questions, Numerical Problems, and most Analytical Problems
can be assigned in and automatically graded by MyEconLab.
xx Preface
A01_ABEL4529_07_SE_FM.QXD  12/11/09  3:35 AM  Page xx
■ Worked numerical problems at the end of selected chapters. The IS-LM/AD-AS model
is the analytic centerpiece of Parts 3 and 4 of the book. In addition to providing
algebraic descriptions of this model in appendixes at the end of selected chap-
ters in Parts 3 and 4, separate appendixes illustrate worked-out numerical
problems using this model.
■ Review of useful analytical tools. Although we use no mathematics beyond
high school algebra, some students will find it handy to have a review
of the book’s main analytical tools. Appendix A (at the end of the text)
succinctly discusses functions of one variable and multiple variables,
graphs, slopes, exponents, and formulas for finding the growth rates of
products and ratios.
■ Glossary. The glossary at the end of the book deﬁnes all key terms (boldface
within the chapter and also listed at the end of each chapter) and refers stu-
dents to the page on which the term is fully deﬁned and discussed.
The seventh edition includes end-of-chapter problems that can be assigned in
and automatically graded by MyEconLab. MyEconLab delivers rich online con-
tent and innovative learning tools to your classroom. Instructors who use
MyEconLab gain access to powerful communication and assessment tools, and
their students receive access to the additional learning resources described

The points on the

CHAPTER 1
Introduction to
Macroeconomics
1.1 What Macroeconomics Is About
Macroeconomics is the study of the structure and performance of national
economies and of the policies that governments use to try to affect economic per-
formance. The issues that macroeconomists address include the following:
■ What determines a nation’s long-run economic growth? In 1870, income per
capita was smaller in Norway than in Argentina. But today, income per
capita is about three times as high in Norway as in Argentina. Why do
some nations’ economies grow quickly, providing their citizens with
rapidly improving living standards, while other nations’ economies are rel-
atively stagnant?
■ What causes a nation’s economic activity to ﬂuctuate? The 1990s exhibited the
longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in U.S. economic history, but
economic performance in the 2000s was much weaker. A mild recession in
2001 was followed by a weak recovery that lasted only until December 2007.
The recession that began at the end of 2007 was worsened by the ﬁnancial
crisis in 2008, which contributed to a sharp decline in output at the end of 2008
and in early 2009. Why do economies sometimes experience sharp short-run
ﬂuctuations, lurching between periods of prosperity and periods of hard times?
■ What causes unemployment? During the 1930s, one-quarter of the work force in
the United States was unemployed. A decade later, during World War II, less
than 2% of the work force was unemployed. Why does unemployment some-
times reach very high levels? Why, even during times of relative prosperity, is
a signiﬁcant fraction of the work force unemployed?
■ What causes prices to rise? The rate of inﬂation in the United States crept steadi-
ly upward during the 1970s, and exceeded 10% per year in the early 1980s,
before dropping to less than 4% per year in the mid 1980s and dropping even
further to less than 2% per year in the late 1990s. Germany’s inﬂation experi-
ence has been much more extreme: Although Germany has earned a reputation
for low inflation in recent decades, following its defeat in World War I
Germany experienced an eighteen-month period (July 1922–December 1923)
during which prices rose by a factor of several billion! What causes inﬂation
and what can be done about it?

2 Part 1 Introduction
■ How does being part of a global economic system affect nations’ economies? In the late
1990s, the U.S. economy was the engine of worldwide economic growth. The
wealth gained by Americans in the stock market led them to increase their
spending on consumer goods, including products made abroad, spurring
greater economic activity in many countries. How do economic links among
nations, such as international trade and borrowing, affect the performance of
individual economies and the world economy as a whole?
■ Can government policies be used to improve a nation’s economic performance? In the
1980s and 1990s, the U.S. economy’s output, unemployment rate, and inﬂation
rate ﬂuctuated much less than they did in the 1960s and 1970s. Some economists
credit good government policy for the improvement in economic performance.
In the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve and the federal government
used extraordinary measures to keep banks and other ﬁnancial institutions from
failing. But some economists criticized these measures for going too far in trying
to stabilize the economy, at the expense of creating incentives for increased risk
taking by ﬁnancial ﬁrms. How should economic policy be conducted so as to
keep the economy as prosperous and stable as possible?
Macroeconomics seeks to offer answers to such questions, which are of great
practical importance and are constantly debated by politicians, the press, and the
public. In the rest of this section, we consider these key macroeconomic issues in
more detail.
Long-Run Economic Growth
If you have ever traveled in a developing country, you could not help but observe
the difference in living standards relative to those of countries such as the United
States. The problems of inadequate food, shelter, and health care experienced by the
poorest citizens of rich nations often represent the average situation for the people
of a developing country . From a macroeconomic perspective, the difference between
rich nations and developing nations may be summarized by saying that rich nations
have at some point in their history experienced extended periods of rapid econom-
ic growth but that the poorer nations either have never experienced sustained
growth or have had periods of growth offset by periods of economic decline.
Figure 1.1 summarizes the growth in output of the U.S. economy since 1869.
1
The record is an impressive one: Over the past century and a third, the annual
output of U.S. goods and services has increased by more than 100 times. The per-
formance of the U.S. economy is not unique, however; other industrial nations
have had similar, and in some cases higher, rates of growth over the same period of
time. This massive increase in the output of industrial economies is one of the cen-
tral facts of modern history and has had enormous political, military, social, and
even cultural implications.
In part, the long-term growth of the U.S. economy is the result of a rising
population, which has meant a steady increase in the number of available workers.
But another signiﬁcant factor is the increase in the amount of output that can be
produced with a given amount of labor. The amount of output produced per unit
1
Output is measured in Fig. 1.1 by two very similar concepts, real gross national product (real GNP)
until 1929 and real gross domestic product (real GDP) since 1929, both of which measure the physical
volume of production in each year. We discuss the measurement of output in detail in Chapter 2.

of labor input—for example, per worker or per hour of work—is called average
labor productivity. Figure 1.2 shows how average labor productivity, deﬁned in
this case as output per employed worker, has changed since 1900. In 2008, the
average U.S. worker produced more than six times as much output as the average
worker at the beginning of the twentieth century, despite working fewer hours over
the course of the year. Because today’s typical worker is so much more productive,
Americans enjoy a signiﬁcantly higher standard of living than would have been
possible a century ago.
Although the long-term record of productivity growth in the U.S. economy is
excellent, productivity growth slowed from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s and
only recently has picked up. Output per worker grew about 2.5% per year from
1949 to 1973, but only 1.1% per year from 1973 to 1995. More recently, from 1995 to
2008, output per worker has increased 1.7% per year, a pace that has improved the
health of the U.S. economy signiﬁcantly.
Because the rates of growth of output and, particularly, of output per worker
ultimately determine whether a nation will be rich or poor, understanding what
determines growth is one of the most important goals of macroeconomics. Unfor-
tunately, explaining why economies grow is not easy. Why, for example, did
resource-poor Japan and Korea experience growth rates that transformed them in a
generation or two from war-torn nations into industrial powers, whereas several
resource-rich nations of Latin America have had erratic or even negative growth in
recent years? Although macroeconomists have nothing close to a complete answer
to the question of what determines rates of economic growth, they do have some
ideas to offer. For example, as we discuss in some detail in this book, most macro-
economists believe that rates of saving and investment are important for growth.
Another key determinant of growth we discuss is the rate at which technological
change and other factors help increase the productivity of machines and workers.

Business Cycles
If you look at the history of U.S. output in Fig. 1.1, you will notice that the growth
of output isn’t always smooth but has hills and valleys. Most striking is the period
between 1929 and 1945, which spans the Great Depression and World War II.
During the 1929–1933 economic collapse that marked the ﬁrst major phase of the
Great Depression, the output of the U.S. economy fell by nearly 30%. Over the
period 1939–1944, as the United States entered World War II and expanded pro-
duction of armaments, output nearly doubled. No ﬂuctuations in U.S. output since
1945 have been as severe as those of the 1929–1945 period. However, during the
postwar era there have been periods of unusually rapid economic growth, such as
during the 1960s and 1990s, and times during which output actually declined from
one year to the next, as in 1973–1975, 1981–1982, and 1990–1991.
Macroeconomists use the term business cycle to describe short-run, but sometimes
sharp, contractions and expansions in economic activity.
2
The downward phase of a
business cycle, during which national output may be falling or perhaps growing only
very slowly , is called a recession. Even when they are relatively mild, recessions mean
hard economic times for many people. Recessions are also a major political concern,
because almost every politician wants to be reelected and the chances of reelection are
better if the nation’s economy is expanding rather than declining. Macroeconomists
put a lot of effort into trying to ﬁgure out what causes business cycles and deciding
what can or should be done about them. In this book we describe a variety of features
of business cycles, compare alternative explanations for cyclical ﬂuctuations, and
evaluate the policy options that are available for affecting the course of the cycle.
2
A more exact deﬁnition is given in Chapter 8. Business cycles do not include ﬂuctuations lasting only
a few months, such as the increase in activity that occurs around Christmas.

Unemployment
One important aspect of recessions is that they usually are accompanied by an
increase in unemployment, or the number of people who are available for work and
are actively seeking work but cannot ﬁnd jobs. Along with growth and business
cycles, the problem of unemployment is a third major issue in macroeconomics.
The best-known measure of unemployment is the unemployment rate, which
is the number of unemployed divided by the total labor force (the number of
people either working or seeking work). Figure 1.3 shows the unemployment rate
in the United States over the past century. The highest and most prolonged period
of unemployment occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s. In 1933, the
unemployment rate was 24.9%, indicating that about one of every four potential
workers was unable to ﬁnd a job. In contrast, the tremendous increase in economic
activity that occurred during World War II signiﬁcantly reduced unemployment. In
1944, at the peak of the wartime boom, the unemployment rate was 1.2%.
Recessions have led to signiﬁcant increases in unemployment in the postwar
period. For example, during the 1981–1982 recession the U.S. unemployment rate
reached 10.8%.
3
Even during periods of economic expansion, however, the unem-
ployment rate remains well above zero, as you can see from Fig. 1.3. In 2000, after
nine years of economic growth with no recession, the unemployment rate was still
about 4%. Why the unemployment rate can remain fairly high even when the econ-
omy as a whole is doing well is another important question in macroeconomics.
3
The unemployment rate was 10.8% in November and December 1982. The unemployment rate plot-
ted in Fig. 1.3 is not this high because the graph only shows annual data—the average unemployment
rate over the 12 months of each year—which was 9.7% in 1982.

Figure 1.4
Consumer prices 
in the United States,
1800–2008
Prior to World War II, the
average level of prices
faced by consumers
remained relatively ﬂat,
with periods of inﬂation
(rising prices) offset by
periods of deﬂation
(falling prices). Since
World War II, however,
prices have risen more
than tenfold. In the
ﬁgure, the average level
of prices is measured by
the consumer price index,
or CPI (see Chapter 2).
The CPI measures the
cost of a ﬁxed set, or
basket, of consumer
goods and services rela-
tive to the cost of the
same goods and services
in a base period—in this
case, 1982–1984. Thus a
CPI of 215.20 in 2008
means that a basket of
consumer goods and
services that cost $100 in
1982–1984 would cost
$215.20 in 2008.

When the prices of most goods and services are rising over time, the economy is said
to be experiencing inﬂation. Figure 1.4 shows a measure of the average level of prices
faced by consumers in the United States over the past two centuries.

Note that prior
to World War II inﬂation usually occurred only during wartime, such as during the War
of 1812, the Civil War, and World War I. These wartime periods of inﬂation were fol-
lowed by periods of deﬂation, during which the prices of most goods and services fell.
The result of these offsetting periods of inﬂation and deﬂation was that, over the long
run, the level of prices was fairly constant. For example, prices at the end of World War
I (1918) stood at about the same level as in 1800, more than a century earlier.
The last signiﬁcant deﬂation in the United States occurred during 1929–1933,
the initial phase of the Great Depression. Since then, inﬂation, without offsetting
deﬂation, has become the normal state of affairs, although inﬂation was fairly low
in the 1990s and 2000s. Figure 1.4 shows that consumer prices have risen signiﬁ-
cantly since World War II, with the measure of prices shown increasing tenfold.
The percentage increase in the average level of prices over a year is called the
inﬂation rate. If the inﬂation rate in consumer prices is 10%, for example, then on
average the prices of items that consumers buy are rising by 10% per year. Rates of
inﬂation may vary dramatically both over time and by country, from 1 or 2 percent
per year in low-inﬂation countries (such as Switzerland) to 1000% per year or more
in countries (such as a number of the former Soviet republics in the early 1990s) that
are experiencing hyperinﬂations, or extreme inﬂations. When the inﬂation rate
reaches an extremely high level, with prices changing daily or hourly, the economy
4
This measure is called the consumer price index, or CPI, which is discussed in Chapter 2. Conceptu-
ally, the CPI is intended to measure the cost of buying a certain ﬁxed set, or “basket,” of consumer
goods and services. However, the construction of a consumer price index over a period as long as two
centuries involves many compromises. For instance, the basket of goods and services priced by the
CPI is not literally the same over the entire period shown in Fig. 1.4 but is periodically changed to
reﬂect the different mix of consumer goods and services available at different times.

tends to function poorly. High inﬂation also means that the purchasing power of
money erodes quickly. This situation forces people to scramble to spend their
money almost as soon as they receive it.
The International Economy
Today every major economy is an open economy, or one that has extensive trading
and ﬁnancial relationships with other national economies. (In contrast, a closed
economy doesn’t interact economically with the rest of the world.) Macroecono-
mists study patterns of international trade and borrowing to understand better the
links among national economies. For example, an important topic in macroeco-
nomics is how international trade and borrowing relationships can help transmit
business cycles from country to country.
Another issue for which international considerations are central is trade imbal-
ances. Figure 1.5 shows the historical behavior of the imports and exports of goods
and services by the United States. U.S. imports are goods and services produced

abroad and purchased by people in the United States; U.S. exports are goods and
services produced in the United States and sold to people in other countries. To
give you a sense of the relative importance of international trade, Fig. 1.5 express-
es exports and imports as percentages of total U.S. output. Currently, both exports
and imports are larger fractions of U.S. output than they were during the 1950s and
1960s, reflecting both the recovery of trade from the disruptions of the Great
Depression and World War II and the trend toward greater economic interdepen-
dence among nations. Note, though, that a century ago exports and imports
already were important relative to the size of the overall economy.
Figure 1.5 demonstrates that exports and imports need not be equal in each year.
For example, following World War I and World War II, U.S. exports outstripped U.S.
imports because the country was sending large quantities of supplies to countries
whose economies had been damaged by war. When exports exceed imports, a trade
surplus exists. In the 1980s, however, U.S. exports declined sharply relative to imports,
a situation that has persisted through the 1990s and into the 2000s, as you can see from
Fig. 1.5. This recent excess of imports over exports, or trade deﬁcit, has received con-
siderable attention from policymakers and the news media. What causes these trade
imbalances? Are they bad for the U.S. economy or for the economies of this country’s
trading partners? These are among the questions that macroeconomists try to answer.
Macroeconomic Policy
A nation’s economic performance depends on many factors, including its natural
and human resources, its capital stock (buildings, machines, and software), its
technology, and the economic choices made by its citizens, both individually and
collectively. Another extremely important factor affecting economic performance is
the set of macroeconomic policies pursued by the government.
Macroeconomic policies affect the performance of the economy as a whole. The
two major types of macroeconomic policies are ﬁscal policy and monetary policy.
Fiscal policy, which is determined at the national, state, and local levels, concerns
government spending and taxation. Monetary policy determines the rate of
growth of the nation’s money supply and is under the control of a government
institution known as the central bank. In the United States, the central bank is the
Federal Reserve System, or the Fed.
One of the main macroeconomic policy issues of recent years in the United
States has been in the realm of ﬁscal policy . Large Federal budget surpluses emerged
in the late 1990s, but these gave way to large Federal budget deﬁcits, averaging 2%
of GDP from 2001 to 2008, and (as of this writing) projected to be over 11% of GDP
in 2009. The recent behavior of the Federal budget is put into a long-term perspec-
tive in Figure. 1.6, which presents data on Federal government spending and tax
revenues for the past century and a third.
5
Again, so that their importance relative
to the economy as a whole is indicated, spending, tax collections, and government
budget deﬁcits and surpluses are expressed as percentages of total output.
Two obvious features of Fig. 1.6 are the peaks in government spending and
deficits that resulted from military buildups in World War I and World War II. At
its high point during World War II, Federal government spending exceeded 43%
5
Government spending includes both government purchases of goods and services, such as
purchases of military equipment and the salaries of government ofﬁcials, and government beneﬁts
paid to individuals, such as Social Security payments.

of total output. Significant deficits also occurred during the Great Depression of
the 1930s because the government increased its spending on various programs
designed to help the economy, such as government-financed jobs programs.
Also shown clearly is the increase in the size of the government sector since World
War II, an increase reﬂected in the major upward shift in government spending and
in tax collections relative to national output that occurred in about 1940 as well as
the mild upward trend in both variables that has occurred since then.
The large and persistent Federal budget deﬁcits of the 1980s and early and mid
1990s were historically unusual in that they occurred during a period of peace and
relative prosperity. The emergence of large Federal deﬁcits in the 1980s coincided
with the emergence of large trade deﬁcits (see Fig. 1.5). Indeed, the Federal budget
deﬁcit and the trade deﬁcit have been called the “twin deﬁcits.” Are these deﬁcits
related? If so, what can be done about them? These questions also fall within the
purview of macroeconomics.
The possible link between the government’s budget deﬁcit and the trade imbal-
ance illustrates an important aspect of macroeconomics: Macroeconomic issues
and problems are frequently interconnected. For this reason, studying one macro-
economic question, such as the effects of the government budget deﬁcit, in isolation
generally is not sufﬁcient. Instead, macroeconomists usually study the economy as
a complete system, recognizing that changes in one sector or market may affect the
behavior of the entire economy.
Aggregation
Macroeconomics is one of two broad areas within the ﬁeld of economics, the other
being microeconomics. Macroeconomics and microeconomics have many basic
M01_ABEL4529_07_SE_C01.QXD  12/9/09  3:42 PM  Page 9
10 Part 1 Introduction
economic ideas and methods in common; the difference between them is the level
at which the economy is studied. Microeconomists focus on individual consumers,
workers, and ﬁrms, each of which is too small to have an impact on the national
economy. Macroeconomists ignore the ﬁne distinctions among the many different
kinds of goods, ﬁrms, and markets that exist in the economy and instead focus on
national totals. For example, in their analyses macroeconomists do not care
whether consumers are buying Microsoft Xboxes or Sony PlayStations, beef or
chicken, Pepsi or Coke. Instead, they add consumer expenditures on all goods and
services to get an overall total called aggregate consumption. The process of sum-
ming individual economic variables to obtain economywide totals is called
aggregation. The use of aggregation and the emphasis on aggregate quantities
such as aggregate consumption, aggregate investment, and aggregate output are
the primary factors that distinguish macroeconomics from microeconomics.
1.2 What Macroeconomists Do
How do macroeconomists use their skills, and what do they do with all the data
they gather and the theories they develop? Besides teaching economics, macro-
economists engage in a wide variety of activities, including forecasting, macroeco-
nomic analysis, basic research, and data development for government, nonproﬁt
organizations, and private businesses.
Macroeconomic Forecasting
Many people believe that economists spend most of their time trying to forecast the
performance of the economy. In fact, except for a relatively small number of fore-
casting specialists, forecasting is a minor part of what macroeconomists do. One
reason macroeconomists don’t emphasize forecasting is that on the whole they are
not terribly good at it! Forecasting is difﬁcult not only because our understanding
of how the economy works is imperfect, but also because it is impossible to take
into account all the factors—many of them not strictly economic—that might affect
future economic trends. Here are some questions that a forecaster, in trying to pro-
ject the course of the economy, might have to try to answer: How will events
abroad affect congressional authorizations for military spending over the next few
years? What oil price will the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) decide on at its next meeting? Will there be a severe drought in agricultur-
al regions, with adverse effects on food quantities and prices? Will productivity rise
as rapidly in the future as it did in the late 1990s and early 2000s as businesses
increasingly adopted computer technology? Because answers to such questions are
highly uncertain, macroeconomic forecasters rarely offer a single prediction.
Instead, they usually combine a “most likely” forecast with “optimistic” and “pes-
simistic” alternative scenarios.
Does the fact that macroeconomics can’t be used to make highly accurate fore-
casts of economic activity mean that it is a pointless ﬁeld of study? Some people
may think so, but that’s really an unreasonable standard. Meteorology is an exam-
ple of a ﬁeld in which forecasting is difﬁcult (will it deﬁnitely be sunny this week-
end?) but in which there is also a lot of useful knowledge (meteorologists helped
discover the depletion of the earth’s ozone layer and pointed out its dangers).
Similarly, cardiologists usually can’t predict if or when a patient will have a heart
M01_ABEL4529_07_SE_C01.QXD  12/9/09  3:42 PM  Page 10
Chapter 1 Introduction to Macroeconomics 11
attack—they can only talk about probabilities. Like meteorologists and doctors,
economists deal with a system whose complexity makes gaining a thorough under-
standing difﬁcult and forecasting the system’s behavior even more difﬁcult. Rather
than predicting what will happen, most macroeconomists are engaged in analyzing
and interpreting events as they happen (macroeconomic analysis) or in trying to
understand the structure of the economy in general (macroeconomic research).
Macroeconomic Analysis
Macroeconomic analysts monitor the economy and think about the implications of
current economic events. Many analysts are employed in the private sector, such as
in banks or large corporations. Private-sector analysts try to determine how general
economic trends will affect their employers’ ﬁnancial investments, their opportu-
nities for expansion, the demand for their products, and so on. Some private ﬁrms
specialize in macroeconomic analysis and assist clients on a fee-for-service basis.
The public sector, which includes national and regional governments and inter-
national agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
also employs many macroeconomic analysts. The main function of public-sector
analysts is to assist in policymaking—for example, by writing reports that assess
various macroeconomic problems and by identifying and evaluating possible
policy options. Among U.S. policymakers, the ofﬁcials who set monetary policy
may call on the aid of several hundred Ph.D. economists employed within the
Federal Reserve System, and the President has the advice of the Council of
Economic Advisers and the professional staffs of numerous departments and agen-
cies. For members of Congress, a frequent source of macroeconomic analysis is the
Congressional Budget Ofﬁce. Economic policymakers also often go outside the
government to seek the advice of macroeconomists from business or academia.
If a country has many well-trained macroeconomic analysts, as is true in the
United States, does that mean that its macroeconomic policies will always be intel-
ligent and farsighted? The answer, unfortunately, is “no.” Because of the complex-
ity of the economy, macroeconomic policy analysis, like macroeconomic
forecasting, often is difficult and uncertain. Perhaps even more important,
politicians, not economists, often make economic policy. Politicians are typically less
concerned with the abstract desirability of a policy than with the policy’s immedi-
ate effects on their constituents. Thus in late 1990 international talks intended to
reduce trade barriers failed because European governments found it politically
inadvisable to reduce high subsidy payments to their farmers—despite the nearly
universal opposition of economists to both trade barriers and farm price support
payments. In 2002, the Bush administration gave in to pressure from the steel
industry and imposed tariffs on certain types of imported steel—despite the nearly
universal opposition of economists to trade barriers.
Although the technical advice provided by macroeconomic analysts is not the
sole basis on which macroeconomic policy is made, such advice is probably neces-
sary for making good policy decisions, especially if dramatic changes are being con-
sidered. Since the 1990s, for example, a number of countries in Eastern Europe, Latin
America, and elsewhere have undertaken radical reforms of their economies. In
most of these cases, the countries’ leaders have sought the technical advice of domes-
tic and foreign economists, and this advice has been inﬂuential in policymaking. In
the former Soviet Union, economists have played an important role in the debate
over restructuring and reform, both as technical specialists and as political advocates.

12 Part 1 Introduction
Macroeconomic Research
Macroeconomic research takes an amazing variety of forms, from abstract mathe-
matical analysis to psychological experimentation to simulation projects in which
computers are used to generate random numbers that represent the randomness of
day-to-day economic activity. Nevertheless, the goal of all macroeconomic research
is to make general statements about how the economy works. The general insights
about the economy gained from successful research form the basis for the analyses
of speciﬁc economic problems, policies, or situations.
To see why research is important, imagine that you are an economist with the
International Monetary Fund whose task is to help a small African country con-
trol its high rate of inﬂation. On what basis can you offer advice? Basically, you
should know what inﬂation-ﬁghting policies other countries have used in the
past, what the results have been, how the results have depended on the charac-
teristics of the country employing the policy, and so on. Particularly if the situa-
tion you are analyzing is not identical to any of the previous cases, having some
theoretical principles would also help you identify and understand the main fac-
tors contributing to that country’s inﬂation. Analyzing the historical cases and
working out the theoretical principles by yourself from scratch might involve
many years’ effort. The value of ongoing research activities is that many of the
results and ideas that you need will already be available in books or profession-
al journals or circulated in unpublished form. Because it forms the basis for
activities such as economic analysis and forecasting, in a very real sense
macroeconomic research is the engine that pulls the whole enterprise of
macroeconomics behind it.
Macroeconomic research takes place primarily in colleges and universities, in
nonproﬁt institutions (such as the National Bureau of Economic Research, the
Brookings Institution, and the American Enterprise Institute), and in the public
sector (the government and international agencies). Particularly in the public sector,
the line between economic analysis and macroeconomic research is much fuzzier
than we have drawn it here. The reason is that many economists move back and
forth between analysis of speciﬁc problems (such as an African country’s inﬂation
problem) and more basic macroeconomic research (such as an analysis of inﬂation
in general).
Economic Theory. How is macroeconomic research carried out? As in many
other ﬁelds, macroeconomic research proceeds primarily through the formulation
and testing of theories. An economic theory is a set of ideas about the economy
that has been organized in a logical framework. Most economic theories are
developed in terms of an economic model, which is a simpliﬁed description of
some aspect of the economy, usually expressed in mathematical form. Economists
evaluate an economic model or theory by applying four criteria:
1. Are its assumptions reasonable and realistic?
2. Is it understandable and manageable enough to be used in studying real
problems?
3. Does it have implications that can be tested by empirical analysis? That is, can
its implications be evaluated by comparing them with data obtained in the real
world?
4. When the implications and the data are compared, are the implications of the
theory consistent with the data?

Chapter 1 Introduction to Macroeconomics 13
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Developing and Testing an Economic Theory
To illustrate the process of developing and testing an economic theory, suppose that
we want to develop a theory that explains the routes that people take when they
commute from home to work and back. Such a theory would be useful, for exam-
ple, to a trafﬁc planner who is concerned about how a proposed housing develop-
ment will affect trafﬁc patterns. Here are the steps we would take.
Step 1. State the research question.
Example: What determines trafﬁc ﬂows in the city during rush hours?
Step 2. Make provisional assumptions that describe the economic setting and the
behavior of the economic actors. These assumptions should be simple yet capture
the most important aspects of the problem.
Example: The setting is described by the map of the city. The assumption about
behavior is that commuters choose routes that minimize driving time.
Step 3. Work out the implications of the theory.
Example: Use the map of the city to plot a route that minimizes driving time
between home and place of work.
Step 4. Conduct an empirical analysis to compare the implications of the theory
with the data.
Example: Conduct a survey of commuters to identify (1) home locations; (2) work
locations; and (3) routes taken to work. Then determine whether the routes predict-
ed by the model are generally the same as those reported in the commuter survey.
Step 5. Evaluate the results of your comparisons.
If the theory ﬁts the data well: Use the theory to predict what would happen if the eco-
nomic setting or economic policies change.
Example: Use the minimum-driving-time assumption to evaluate the trafﬁc effects
of a new housing development by ﬁguring out which routes the residents of the
development are likely to take.
If the theory ﬁts the data poorly: Start from scratch with a new model. Repeat Steps 2–5.
Example: Change the provisional behavioral assumption to the following: Com-
muters choose the route that minimizes the distance they must drive (not the time
they spend driving).
If the theory ﬁts the data moderately well: Either make do with a partially successful
theory or modify the model with additional assumptions and then repeat Steps 3–5.
Example: A possible modiﬁcation of the minimum-driving-time assumption is that
commuters will choose more scenic over less scenic routes, if driving time is not
increased by more than a certain number of minutes. To test the model with this
modiﬁed assumption, you must determine which routes are more scenic (those that
pass a lake) and which are less scenic (those that pass a dump).
For a theory or model—of any type, not just economic—to be useful, the
answer to each of these questions must be “yes.” Unfortunately, though, econo-
mists may not always agree in their evaluation of a particular model, with the
result that controversies sometimes persist about the best way to model a given
economic situation.

14 Part 1 Introduction
We present a summary of the main steps in developing and testing an eco-
nomic theory or model in “In Touch with Data and Research: Developing and Test-
ing an Economic Theory,” p. 13.
Data Development
The collection of economic data is a vital part of macroeconomics, and many econ-
omists are involved in the data development process. In the United States as well
as all other major countries, data on thousands of economic variables are collected
and analyzed. We have already presented some important macroeconomic data
series, such as measures of output and the price level, and will look at these and
others in more detail in Chapter 2. Macroeconomists use economic data to assess
the current state of the economy, make forecasts, analyze policy alternatives, and
test macroeconomic theories.
Most economic data are collected and published by the Federal government—
for example, by agencies such as the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the United States, and by central
banks such as the Federal Reserve. To an increasing degree, however, these activi-
ties also take place in the private sector. For example, marketing ﬁrms and private
economic forecasting companies are important collectors, users, and sellers of eco-
nomic data. In this book, many of the boxes called “In Touch with Data and
Research” describe major macroeconomic data series and tell you how they are col-
lected and where to ﬁnd them; other “In Touch with Data and Research” boxes
describe topics and issues in macroeconomic research.
Much of the data collection and preparation process is routine. However,
because providers of data want their numbers to be as useful as possible while
keeping costs down, the organization of major data collection projects is typically
the joint effort of many skilled professionals. Providers of data must decide what
types of data should be collected on the basis of who is expected to use the data and
how. They must take care that measures of economic activity correspond to abstract
concepts (such as “capital” and “labor”) that are suggested by economic theory. In
addition, data providers must guarantee the conﬁdentiality of data that may reveal
information about individual ﬁrms and people in the economy. In a large data-
gathering organization such as the Bureau of the Census, each of these issues is
exhaustively analyzed by economists and statisticians before data collection begins.

1.3 Why Macroeconomists Disagree
Over the years, the efforts of thousands of analysts, data collectors, and researchers
have greatly enhanced the understanding of macroeconomic phenomena. Yet no
matter what the macroeconomic issue, the news media seemingly can ﬁnd an econo-
mist to argue either side of it. Why do macroeconomists appear to disagree so much?

For a readable discussion of issues that face data collectors, see Janet L. Norwood, “Distinguished
Lecture on Economics in Government: Data Quality and Public Policy,” Journal of Economic Perspec-
tives, Spring 1990, pp. 3–12.
7
Not only do macroeconomists often seem to disagree with one another, but they also sometimes are
accused of not being able to agree with themselves. President Harry Truman expressed the frustration
of many policymakers when he said he wanted a one-handed economist—one who wouldn’t always
say, “On the one hand, . . . ; on the other hand. . . .”
M01_ABEL4529_07_SE_C01.QXD  12/9/09  3:42 PM  Page 14
Chapter 1 Introduction to Macroeconomics 15
To a certain extent, the amount of disagreement among macroeconomists is
exaggerated by the tendency of the public and the media to focus on the most dif-
ﬁcult and controversial issues. In addition, the very fact that economic policy and
performance are of such broad interest and concern contributes to the intensity of
debate: More than controversies in many other ﬁelds, debates in macroeconomics
tend to take place in public, rather than in the seminar room or the laboratory.
Although important disagreements among macroeconomists certainly exist, there
also are many areas of substantial agreement in macroeconomics.
We can provide an insight into why macroeconomists disagree by drawing the
important distinction between positive and normative analyses of economic policy.
A positive analysis of an economic policy examines the economic consequences of a
policy but doesn’t address the question of whether those consequences are desirable.
A normative analysis of policy tries to determine whether a certain policy
should be used. For example, if an economist is asked to evaluate the effects on the
economy of a 5% reduction in the income tax, the response involves a positive
analysis. But if asked whether the income tax should be reduced by 5%, the econo-
mist’s response requires a normative analysis. This normative analysis will involve
not only the economist’s objective, scientiﬁc understanding of how the economy
works but also personal value judgments—for example, about the appropriate size
of the government sector or the amount of income redistribution that is desirable.
Economists may agree on the positive analysis of a question yet disagree on the
normative part because of differences in values. Value differences also are common
in other ﬁelds: Physicists may be in perfect agreement on what would happen if a
nuclear bomb were detonated (a positive analysis). But physicist “hawks” and
physicist “doves” may disagree strongly about whether nuclear weapons should be
deployed (a normative question).
Disagreement may occur on positive issues, however, and these differences are
important in economics. In macroeconomics there always have been many schools
of thought, each with a somewhat different perspective on how the economy
works. Examples include monetarism and supply-side economics, both of
which we discuss in this book. However, the most important—and enduring—
disagreements on positive issues in macroeconomics involve the two schools of
thought called the classical approach and the Keynesian approach.
Classicals Versus Keynesians
The classical approach and the Keynesian approach are the two major intellectual
traditions in macroeconomics. We discuss the differences between the two
approaches brieﬂy here and in much greater detail later in the book.
The Classical Approach. The origins of the classical approach go back more than
two centuries, at least to the famous Scottish economist Adam Smith. In 1776
Smith published his classic, The Wealth of Nations, in which he proposed the
concept of the “invisible hand.” The idea of the invisible hand is that, if there are
free markets and individuals conduct their economic affairs in their own best
interests, the overall economy will work well. As Smith put it, in a market
economy, individuals pursuing their own self-interests seem to be led by an
invisible hand to maximize the general welfare of everyone in the economy.
However, we must not overstate what Smith claimed: To say that an invisible
hand is at work does not mean that no one in a market economy will be hungry or
M01_ABEL4529_07_SE_C01.QXD  12/9/09  3:42 PM  Page 15
16 Part 1 Introduction
dissatisﬁed; free markets cannot insulate a nation from the effects of drought, war,
or political instability. Nor does the invisible hand rule out the existence of great
inequalities between the rich and the poor, because in Smith’s analysis he took the
initial distribution of wealth among people as given. Rather, the invisible-hand idea
says that given a country’s resources (natural, human, and technological) and its
initial distribution of wealth, the use of free markets will make people as econom-
ically well off as possible.
Validity of the invisible-hand idea depends on a key assumption: The various
markets in the economy, including ﬁnancial markets, labor markets, and markets
for goods and services, must function smoothly and without impediments such as
minimum wages and interest rate ceilings. In particular, wages and prices must
adjust rapidly enough to maintain equilibrium—a situation in which the quantities
demanded and supplied are equal—in all markets. In markets where quantity
demanded exceeds quantity supplied, prices must rise to bring the market into
equilibrium. In markets where more of a good is available than people want to buy,
prices must fall to bring the market into equilibrium.
Wage and price ﬂexibility is crucial to the invisible-hand idea, because in a free-
market system, changes in wages and prices are the signals that coordinate the
actions of people in the economy. To illustrate, suppose that war abroad disrupts oil
imports. This drop in supply will drive up the price of oil. A higher oil price will
make it proﬁtable for domestic oil suppliers to pump more oil and to drill more
wells. The higher price will also induce domestic consumers to conserve oil and to
switch to alternative sources of energy. Increased demand for alternative energy
sources will raise their prices and stimulate their production, and so on. Thus, in the
absence of impediments such as government price controls, the adjustment of
prices helps the free-market economy respond in a constructive and coordinated
way to the initial disruption of supplies.
The classical approach to macroeconomics builds on Smith’s basic assumptions
that people pursue their own economic self-interests and that prices adjust rea-
sonably quickly to achieve equilibrium in all markets. With these two assump-
tions as a basis, followers of the classical approach attempt to construct models of
the macroeconomy that are consistent with the data and that can be used to answer
the questions raised at the beginning of this chapter.
The use of the classical approach carries with it some strong policy implica-
tions. Because the classical assumptions imply that the invisible hand works well,
classical economists often argue (as a normative proposition) that the government
should have, at most, a limited role in the economy. As a positive proposition, clas-
sical economists also often argue that government policies will be ineffective or
counterproductive at achieving their stated goals. Thus, for example, most classi-
cals believe that the government should not try actively to eliminate business
cycles.
The Keynesian Approach. Compared with the classical approach, the
Keynesian approach is relatively recent. The book that introduced it, The General
Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, by British economist John Maynard
Keynes, appeared in 1936—160 years after Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. In
1936 the world was suffering through the Great Depression: Unprecedentedly
high rates of unemployment had afﬂicted most of the world’s economies for
years, and the invisible hand of free markets seemed completely ineffective. From
the viewpoint of 1936, the classical theory appeared to be seriously inconsistent
M01_ABEL4529_07_SE_C01.QXD  12/9/09  3:42 PM  Page 16
Chapter 1 Introduction to Macroeconomics 17
with the data, creating a need for a new macroeconomic theory. Keynes provided
this theory.
In his book, Keynes offered an explanation of persistently high unemploy-
ment.
8
He based this explanation on an assumption about wage and price adjust-
ment that was fundamentally different from the classical assumption. Instead of
assuming that wages and prices adjust rapidly to achieve equilibrium in each
market, as in the classical tradition, Keynes assumed that wages and prices adjust
slowly. Slow wage and price adjustment meant that markets could be out of
equilibrium—with quantities demanded not equal to quantities supplied—for long
periods of time. In the Keynesian theory, unemployment can persist because wages
and prices don’t adjust quickly enough to equalize the number of people that ﬁrms
want to employ with the number of people who want to work.
Keynes’s proposed solution to high unemployment was to have the govern-
ment increase its purchases of goods and services, thus raising the demand for
output. Keynes argued that this policy would reduce unemployment because, to
meet the higher demands for their products, businesses would have to employ
more workers. In addition, Keynes suggested, the newly hired workers would
have more income to spend, creating another source of demand for output that
would raise employment further. More generally, in contrast to classicals, Keyne-
sians tend to be skeptical about the invisible hand and thus are more willing to
advocate a role for government in improving macroeconomic performance.
The Evolution of the Classical–Keynesian Debate. Because the Great Depression
so strongly shook many economists’ faith in the classical approach, the Keynesian
approach dominated macroeconomic theory and policy from World War II until
about 1970. At the height of Keynesian inﬂuence, economists widely believed
that, through the skillful use of macroeconomic policies, the government could
promote economic growth while avoiding inﬂation or recession. The main
problems of macroeconomics apparently had been solved, with only some details to
be ﬁlled in.
However, in the 1970s the United States suffered from both high unemploy-
ment and high inﬂation—called stagﬂation, or stagnation plus inﬂation. This expe-
rience weakened economists’ and policymakers’ confidence in the traditional
Keynesian approach, much as the Great Depression had undermined the tradi-
tional classical approach. In addition, the Keynesian assumption that prices and
wages adjust slowly, so that markets may be out of equilibrium, was criticized as
being without sound theoretical foundations. While the Keynesian approach was
coming under attack, developments in economic theory made classical macroeco-
nomics look more interesting and attractive to many economists. Starting in the
early 1970s, a modernized classical approach enjoyed a major resurgence among
macroeconomic researchers, although classical macroeconomics did not achieve the
dominance that Keynesianism had enjoyed in the early postwar years.
In the past three decades, advocates of both approaches have reworked them
extensively to repair their weaknesses. Economists working in the classical tradi-
tion have improved their explanations of business cycles and unemployment.
8
Actually, Keynes presented a number of explanations of unemployment in his book, and debate
continues about “what Keynes really meant.” Our interpretation of what Keynes meant is the one
adopted by his major followers.
M01_ABEL4529_07_SE_C01.QXD  12/9/09  3:42 PM  Page 17
18 Part 1 Introduction
Keynesians have worked on the development of sound theoretical foundations for
the slow adjustment of wages and prices, and Keynesian models can now
accommodate stagﬂation. Currently, excellent research is being conducted with
both approaches, and substantial communication and cross-fertilization are occur-
ring between them.
A Unified Approach to Macroeconomics
In writing this book, we needed a strategy to deal with the fact that there are two
major macroeconomic schools of thought. One strategy would have been to empha-
size one of the two schools of thought and to treat the other only brieﬂy. The prob-
lem with that strategy is that it would not expose you to the full range of ideas and
insights that compose modern macroeconomics. Alternatively, we might have pre-
sented the two approaches separately and then compared and contrasted their
conclusions—but you would have missed the opportunity to explore the large
common ground shared by the two schools of thought.
Our choice was to take an approach to macroeconomics that is as balanced and
uniﬁed as possible. In keeping with this uniﬁed approach, all our analyses in this
book—whether of economic growth, business cycles, inﬂation, or policy , and whether
classical or Keynesian in spirit—are based on a single economic model, or on compo-
nents or extensions of the basic model. This economic model, which draws heavily
from both the classical and Keynesian traditions, has the following characteristics.
1. Individuals, ﬁrms, and the government interact in goods markets, asset mar-
kets, and labor markets. We have already discussed the need for aggregation in
macroeconomics. In the economic model of this book we follow standard
macroeconomic practice and aggregate all the markets in the economy into
three major markets: the market for goods and services, the asset market (in
which assets such as money, stocks, bonds, and real estate are traded), and the
labor market. We show how participants in the economy interact in each of
these three markets and how these markets relate to one another and to the
economy as a whole.
2. The model’s macroeconomic analysis is based on the analysis of individual behav-
ior. Macroeconomic behavior reﬂects the behaviors of many individuals and ﬁrms
interacting in markets. To understand how individuals and ﬁrms behave, we take
a “bottom-up” approach and focus our analysis at the level of individual decision
making (as in “In Touch with Data and Research: Developing and Testing an Eco-
nomic Theory,” p. 13, where we discuss a model of individual choices about the
route to take to work). The insights gained are then used for studying the economy
as a whole.
The guiding principle in analyzing the behavior of individuals and ﬁrms is the
assumption that they try to maximize their own economic satisfaction, given their
needs, desires, opportunities, and resources. Although the founder of classical eco-
nomics, Adam Smith, emphasized this assumption, it is generally accepted by
Keynesians and classicals alike, and it is used in virtually all modern macroeco-
nomic research.
3. Although Keynesians reject the classical assumption that wages and prices
quickly adjust to achieve equilibrium in the short run, Keynesians and classicals both
agree that, in the long run, prices and wages fully adjust to achieve equilibrium in the mar-
kets for goods, assets, and labor. Because complete ﬂexibility of wages and prices in the
M01_ABEL4529_07_SE_C01.QXD  12/9/09  3:42 PM  Page 18
Chapter 1 Introduction to Macroeconomics 19
long run is not controversial, we examine the long-term behavior of the economy
(Chapters 3–7) before discussing short-run issues associated with business cycles
(Chapters 8–13).
4. The basic model that we present may be used with either the classical assumption
that wages and prices are ﬂexible or the Keynesian assumption that wages and prices
are slow to adjust. This aspect of the model allows us to compare classical and
Keynesian conclusions and policy recommendations within a common theoretical
framework.
CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. Macroeconomics is the study of the structure and
performance of national economies and the policies
that governments use to try to affect economic per-
formance. Important topics in macroeconomics
include the determinants of long-run economic
growth, business cycles, unemployment, inflation,
international trade and lending, and macroeconomic
policy.
2. Because macroeconomics covers the economy as a
whole, macroeconomists ignore the ﬁne distinctions
among different kinds of goods, firms, or markets
and focus on national totals such as aggregate con-
sumption. The process of adding individual eco-
nomic variables to obtain economywide totals is
called aggregation.
3. The activities engaged in by macroeconomists
include (in addition to teaching) forecasting, macro-
economic analysis, macroeconomic research, and
data development.
4. The goal of macroeconomic research is to be able to
make general statements about how the economy
works. Macroeconomic research makes progress
toward this goal by developing economic theories
and testing them empirically—that is, by seeing
whether they are consistent with data obtained from
the real world. A useful economic theory is based on
reasonable and realistic assumptions, is easy to use,
has implications that can be tested in the real world,
and is consistent with the data and the observed
behavior of the real-world economy.
5. A positive analysis of an economic policy examines
the economic consequences of the policy but does
not address the question of whether those conse-
quences are desirable. A normative analysis of a
policy tries to determine whether the policy should be
used. Disagreements among macroeconomists may
arise because of differences in normative conclusions,
as the result of differences in personal values and
beliefs, and because of differences in the positive
analysis of a policy proposal.
6. The classical approach to macroeconomics is based
on the assumptions that individuals and ﬁrms act in
their own best interests and that wages and prices
adjust quickly to achieve equilibrium in all markets.
Under these assumptions the invisible hand of the
free-market economy works well, with only a limited
scope for government intervention in the economy.
7. The Keynesian approach to macroeconomics
assumes that wages and prices do not adjust rapidly
and thus the invisible hand may not work well.
Keynesians argue that, because of slow wage and
price adjustment, unemployment may remain high
for a long time. Keynesians are usually more
inclined than classicals to believe that government
intervention in the economy may help improve eco-
nomic performance.

All numerical problems are available in 
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. Here are some macroeconomic data for the country of Oz
for the years 2008 and 2009.
As the data suggest, Oz produces only potatoes, and its
monetary unit is the shekel. Calculate each of the follow-
ing macroeconomic variables for Oz, being sure to give
units.

between 2008 and 2009.
c. The unemployment rate in 2008 and 2009.
d. The inﬂation rate between 2008 and 2009.
2. In a recent issue of the Survey of Current Business, ﬁnd
the data section entitled “Selected NIPA Tables.” In
Table 1.1.5, “Gross Domestic Product,” ﬁnd data on
gross domestic product (a measure of total output),
exports, and imports. In Table 3.2, “Federal Govern-
ment Current Receipts and Expenditures,”ﬁnd data on
the government’s total receipts (taxes) and expendi-
tures. These tables from the Survey of Current Business
can be accessed from the home page of the Bureau of
Economic Analysis at www.bea.gov.

1. Can average labor productivity fall even though total
output is rising? Can the unemployment rate rise even
though total output is rising?
2. Prices were much higher in the United States in 2009

WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. a. Calculate the total percentage growth in average
labor productivity in the U.S. economy for the 1950s,
1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Deﬁne average labor
productivity for any year as real gross domestic
product in the last quarter of the year divided by
civilian employment in the last month of the year. In
which decades did average labor productivity grow
the most quickly overall? The most slowly? Express
the growth rates for each decade in annualized
terms by using the formula
where g is the annual growth rate, expressed as a
decimal (for example, 0.05 for 5%), and G is the
growth rate for the decade (the change in produc-
tivity during the decade divided by the initial pro-
ductivity level). For each of the ﬁve decades, use
your calculated values for G and the formula above
to solve for g.
(1 + g)
10
= 1 + G
b. Calculate annual labor productivity growth rates for
each year since 2000 for which data are available.
How do the recent growth rates compare with those
of the ﬁve previous decades?
2. Graph the behavior of the civilian unemployment rate
from 1961 until the present using monthly data. Can
you see the periods of recession that occurred in
1969–1970, 1973–1975, 1980, 1981–1982, 1990–1991, and
2001? In terms of the unemployment rate, how does
the recession that began in 2007 compare in severity
with those earlier downturns? How does the behavior
of the unemployment rate over the 2000s compare to
its behavior in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s?
3. Using data on the consumer price index (CPI) for all
urban consumers, calculate and graph the annual U.S.
inﬂation rate (the percentage change in the price index,
December to December) for each year since 1948. In
which periods within the postwar era did the United
States experience the most severe inﬂation problems?
In which periods has inﬂation been the most stable
(that is, roughly constant from one year to the next)?
3. State a theory for why people vote Republican or
Democratic that potentially could satisfy the criteria for
a useful theory given in the text. How would you go
about testing your theory?
4. Which of the following statements are positive in
nature and which are normative?
a. A tax cut will raise interest rates.
b. A reduction in the payroll tax would primarily ben-
eﬁt poor and middle-class workers.
c. Payroll taxes are too high.
d. A cut in the payroll tax would improve the Presi-
dent’s popularity ratings.
e. Payroll taxes should not be cut unless capital gains
taxes are cut also.
5. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on
certain types of imported steel. He argued that foreign
steel producers were dumping their steel on the U.S.
market at low prices. The foreign steel producers were
able to sell steel cheaply because they received subsi-
dies from their governments. The Bush administration
argued that the inﬂux of steel was disrupting the U.S.
economy, harming the domestic steel industry, and
causing unemployment among U.S. steel workers.
What might a classical economist say in response to
these claims? Would a Keynesian economist be more or
less sympathetic to the imposition of tariffs? Why?

CHAPTER 2
The Measurement 
and Structure of the
National Economy
Measurement is a crucial part of scientific study. Accurate measurement is essen-
tial for making new discoveries, evaluating competing theories, and predicting
future events or trends. During the first half of the twentieth century, painstak-
ing research by economists such as Nobel Prize winner Simon Kuznets (the first
person to obtain comprehensive measures of national output) and the team of
Arthur Burns and Wesley Mitchell (who performed detailed measurements of
the stages of the business cycle) showed that careful economic measurement is
not only possible but also necessary for any serious understanding of the
economy. Their work, and the efforts of many other researchers, transformed
economics from a field in which scholars relied on informal observations and
broad generalizations to one in which numbers and statistical analysis play an
essential role.
In this chapter we present some of the conceptual and practical issues
involved in measuring the macroeconomy. We focus on the national income
accounts, a framework for measuring economic activity that is widely used by
economic researchers and analysts. Learning about the national income
accounts will familiarize you with some useful economic data. In addition,
because the national income accounts are set up in a logical way that mirrors
the structure of the economy, working through these accounts is an important
first step toward understanding how the macroeconomy works. When you
finish this chapter, you will have a clearer understanding of the relationships
that exist among key macroeconomic variables and among the different sectors
of the economy.
2.1 National Income Accounting: The Measurement 
of Production, Income, and Expenditure
The national income accounts are an accounting framework used in measuring
current economic activity. Almost all countries have some form of ofﬁcial national
income accounts. (For background information on the U.S. national income
accounts, see “In Touch with Data and Research: The National Income and Product
Accounts,” p. 24.)
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:25 PM  Page 22
The national income accounts are based on the idea that the amount of
economic activity that occurs during a period of time can be measured in terms of
1. the amount of output produced, excluding output used up in intermediate
stages of production (the product approach);
2. the incomes received by the producers of output (the income approach); and
3. the amount of spending by the ultimate purchasers of output (the expendi-
ture approach).
Each approach gives a different perspective on the economy. However, the
fundamental principle underlying national income accounting is that, except for
problems such as incomplete or misreported data, all three approaches give identical
measurements of the amount of current economic activity.
We can illustrate why these three approaches are equivalent by an example.
Imagine an economy with only two businesses, called OrangeInc and JuiceInc.
OrangeInc owns and operates orange groves. It sells some of its oranges directly to
the public. It sells the rest of its oranges to JuiceInc, which produces and sells orange
juice. The following table shows the transactions of each business during a year.
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 23
OrangeInc Transactions
Wages paid to OrangeInc employees $15,000
Taxes paid to government 5,000
Revenue received from sale of oranges 35,000
Oranges sold to public 10,000
Oranges sold to JuiceInc 25,000
JuiceInc Transactions
Wages paid to JuiceInc employees $10,000
Taxes paid to government 2,000
Oranges purchased from OrangeInc 25,000
Revenue received from sale of orange juice 40,000
OrangeInc pays $15,000 per year in wages to workers to pick oranges, and it sells
these oranges for $35,000 ($10,000 worth of oranges to households and $25,000 worth
of oranges to JuiceInc). Thus OrangeInc’s proﬁt before taxes is $35,000 - $15,000 =
$20,000. Because OrangeInc pays taxes of $5000, its after-tax proﬁt is $15,000.
JuiceInc buys $25,000 of oranges from OrangeInc and pays wages of $10,000 to
workers to process the oranges into orange juice. It sells the orange juice for
$40,000, so its proﬁt before taxes is $5000 ($40,000 - $25,000 - $10,000). After paying
taxes of $2000, its after-tax proﬁt is $3000.
What is the total value, measured in dollars, of the economic activity generated
by these two businesses? The product approach, income approach, and expenditure
approach are three different ways of arriving at the answer to this question; all
yield the same answer.
1. The product approach measures economic activity by adding the market
values of goods and services produced, excluding any goods and services used
up in intermediate stages of production. This approach makes use of the value-
added concept. The value added of any producer is the value of its output minus
the value of the inputs it purchases from other producers. The product approach
computes economic activity by summing the value added by all producers.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:25 PM  Page 23
24 Part 1 Introduction
In our example, OrangeInc produces output worth $35,000 and JuiceInc pro-
duces output worth $40,000. However, measuring overall economic activity by
simply adding $35,000 and $40,000 would “double count” the $25,000 of oranges
that JuiceInc purchased from OrangeInc and processed into juice. To avoid this
double counting, we sum value added rather than output: Because JuiceInc
processed oranges worth $25,000 into a product worth $40,000, JuiceInc’s value
added is $15,000 ($40,000 - $25,000). OrangeInc doesn’t use any inputs purchased
from other businesses, so its value added equals its revenue of $35,000. Thus total
value added in the economy is $35,000 + $15,000 = $50,000.
2. The income approach measures economic activity by adding all income
received by producers of output, including wages received by workers and proﬁts
received by owners of ﬁrms. As you have seen, the (before-tax) proﬁts of OrangeInc
equal its revenues of $35,000 minus its wage costs of $15,000, or $20,000. The proﬁts of
JuiceInc equal its revenues of $40,000 minus the $25,000 the company paid to buy
oranges and the $10,000 in wages paid to its employees, or $5000. Adding the $20,000
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The National Income and Product Accounts
In the United States, the national income accounts are ofﬁcially called the National
Income and Product Accounts, or NIPA. These accounts provide comprehensive
measurements of production, income, and expenditure for the U.S. economy.
Developed in the 1930s and 1940s by the Department of Commerce, the U.S.
national income accounts were used for economic planning during World War II.
Ofﬁcial accounts have been constructed as far back as 1929, and some ofﬁcial data
are available from as early as 1909.
Currently, the accounts are constructed quarterly by government economists
and statisticians in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), a part of the Depart-
ment of Commerce. In constructing the accounts, the BEA relies heavily on data
provided by other government agencies, such as the Census Bureau and the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. The BEA also uses data from tax returns and from private
sources, such as industry associations.
Initial estimates of quarterly economic activity are released about one month
after the end of each quarter. The data are then revised about one month later, and
revised a second time about one month after that.
Historical NIPA data may be obtained from numerous sources, including the
Survey of Current Business (the BEA’s monthly publication) and the Economic Report
of the President, which is issued each February by the President’s Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers. Latest-quarter NIPA data appear in the business press, which
gives extensive coverage to the BEA’s monthly releases. The BEA’s home page at
www.bea.gov provides access to current and historical data. Data on many NIPA
variables can be downloaded conveniently from the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2. National income accounts
data for other countries are available in National Accounts, a publication of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in World
Economic Outlook (published by the International Monetary Fund), and in the
United Nations’ National Accounts Statistics.

proﬁt of OrangeInc, the $5000 proﬁt of JuiceInc, and the $25,000 in wage income
received by the employees of the two companies, we get a total of $50,000, the same
amount determined by the product approach.
In this calculation we added the before-tax incomes of workers and firm
owners. Equivalently, we could have added the after-tax incomes of producers
of output and the taxes received by the government. Recall that, when taxes are
subtracted, OrangeInc’s after-tax profits are $15,000 and JuiceInc’s after-tax
profits are $3000. Adding the two firms’ after-tax profits of $18,000, total wage
income of $25,000 (we assumed that workers pay no taxes), and the $7000 in
taxes received by the government, we again obtain $50,000 as the measure of
economic activity.
3. Finally, the expenditure approach measures activity by adding the amount
spent by all ultimate users of output. In this example, households are ultimate users
of oranges. JuiceInc is not an ultimate user of oranges because it sells the oranges
(in processed, liquid form) to households. Thus ultimate users purchase $10,000 of
oranges from OrangeInc and $40,000 of orange juice from JuiceInc for a total of
$50,000, the same amount computed in both the product and the expenditure
approaches.
1
Why the Three Approaches Are Equivalent
That the product, income, and expenditure approaches all give the same answer is
no accident. The logic of these three approaches is such that they must always give
the same answer.
To see why, first observe that the market value of goods and services
produced in a given period is by deﬁnition equal to the amount that buyers must
spend to purchase them. JuiceInc’s orange juice has a market value of $40,000
only because that is what people are willing to spend to buy it. The market value
of a good or service and the spending on that good or service are always the
same, so the product approach (which measures market values) and the expen-
diture approach (which measures spending) must give the same measure of
economic activity.
2
Next, observe that what the seller receives must equal what the buyers spend.
The seller’s receipts in turn equal the total income generated by the economic
activity, including the incomes paid to workers and suppliers, taxes paid to the gov-
ernment, and proﬁts (whatever is left over). Thus total expenditure must equal total
income generated, implying that the expenditure and income approaches must
also produce the same answer. Finally, as both product value and income equal
expenditure, they also must be equal.
Because of the equivalence of the three approaches, over any speciﬁed time period
(2.1) total production = total income = total expenditure,
1
In the example, each business also purchases labor services from employees, but because these
services are used in production, they aren’t counted as services purchased by ultimate users.
2
Our explanation implicitly assumes that everything produced is sold. What if a ﬁrm produces some
goods that it can’t sell? As we discuss shortly, the national income accounts treat unsold goods as
though they were purchased by the ﬁrm from itself; that is, accumulation of unsold goods in inven-
tory is treated as part of expenditure. Thus expenditure and production remain equal even if some
goods remain unsold.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 25
where production, income, and expenditure all are measured in the same units (for
example, in dollars). Equation (2.1) is called the fundamental identity of national
income accounting and forms the basis for national income accounting. (An identity is
an equation that is true by deﬁnition.) In Section 2.2, we show how this fundamental
identity is used in measuring current economic activity for the economy as a whole.
2.2 Gross Domestic Product
The broadest measure of aggregate economic activity, as well as the best-known and
most often used, is the gross domestic product, or GDP . As in the example in Section 2.1,
a country’s GDP may be measured by the product approach, the expenditure approach,
or the income approach. Although the three approaches arrive at the same value for
GDP, each views GDP differently. Using all three approaches gives a more complete
picture of an economy’s structure than any single approach could.
The Product Approach to Measuring GDP
The product approach deﬁnes a nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) as the
market value of ﬁnal goods and services newly produced within a nation during a
ﬁxed period of time. In working through the various parts of this deﬁnition, we dis-
cuss some practical issues that arise in measuring GDP .
Market Value. Goods and services are counted in GDP at their market values—
that is, at the prices at which they are sold. The advantage of using market values
is that it allows adding the production of different goods and services. Imagine, for
example, that you want to measure the total output of an economy that produces 7
cars and 100 pairs of shoes. Adding the number of cars and the number of pairs of
shoes to get a total output of 107 wouldn’t make much sense because cars and
shoes aren’t of equal economic value. But suppose that each car sells for $20,000
and each pair of shoes sells for $60. Taking these market-determined prices as
measures of relative economic values, you can calculate the value of cars produced
as $140,000 (7 * $20,000) and the value of shoes produced as $6000 (100 * $60). The
total market value of production, or GDP, is $140,000 + $6000 = $146,000. Using
market values to measure production makes sense because it takes into account
differences in the relative economic importance of different goods and services.
A problem with using market values to measure GDP is that some useful
goods and services are not sold in formal markets. Ideally, GDP should be adjust-
ed upward to reﬂect the existence of these goods and services. However, because of
the difﬁculty of obtaining reliable measures, some nonmarket goods and services
simply are ignored in the calculation of GDP. Homemaking and child-rearing
services performed within the family without pay, for example, are not included in
GDP , although homemaking and child care that are provided for pay (for example,
by professional housecleaners or by private day-care centers) are included. Simi-
larly, because the beneﬁts of clean air and water aren’t bought and sold in markets,
actions to reduce pollution or otherwise improve environmental quality usually are
not reﬂected in GDP (see “In Touch with Data and Research: Natural Resources, the
Environment, and the National Income Accounts,” p. 29).
Some nonmarket goods and services are partially incorporated in official
GDP measures. An example is activities in the so-called underground economy.
26 Part 1 Introduction
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 26
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 27
The underground economy includes both legal activities hidden from govern-
ment record keepers (to avoid payment of taxes or compliance with regulations, for
example) and illegal activities such as drug dealing, prostitution, and (in some
places) gambling. Some might argue that activities such as drug dealing are “bads”
rather than “goods” and shouldn’t be included in GDP anyway—although a
consistent application of this argument might rule out many goods and services
currently included in GDP. Clearly, though, the services of a housepainter who is
paid in cash to avoid taxes should be included in GDP . Government statisticians are
unable to reliably adjust GDP ﬁgures to include estimates of the underground
economy’s size, but they do make some adjustments for underreported income.
3
A particularly important component of economic activity that does not pass
through markets is the value of the services provided by government, such as
defense, public education, and the building and maintenance of roads and bridges.
The fact that most government services are not sold in markets implies a lack of
market values to use when calculating the government’s contribution to GDP. In
this case, the solution that has been adopted is to value government services at their
cost of production. Thus the contribution of national defense to GDP equals the
government’s cost of providing defense: the salaries of service and civilian
personnel, the costs of building and maintaining weapons and bases, and so on.
Similarly, the contribution of public education to GDP is measured by the cost of
teachers’ salaries, new schools and equipment, and so on.
Newly Produced Goods and Services. As a measure of current economic
activity, GDP includes only goods or services that are newly produced within the
current period. GDP excludes purchases or sales of goods that were produced in
previous periods. Thus, although the market price paid for a newly constructed
house would be included in GDP, the price paid in the sale of a used house is not
counted in GDP. (The value of the used house would have been included in GDP
for the year it was built.) However, the value of the services of the real estate agent
involved in the sale of the used house is part of GDP, because those services are
provided in the current period.
Final Goods and Services. Goods and services produced during a period of
time may be classiﬁed as either intermediate goods and services or ﬁnal goods
and services. Intermediate goods and services are those used up in the
production of other goods and services in the same period that they themselves were
produced. For example, ﬂour that is produced and then used to make bread in the
same year is an intermediate good. The trucking company that delivers the ﬂour
to the bakery provides an intermediate service.
Final goods and services are those goods and services that are not intermediate.
Final goods and services are the end products of a process. For example, bread pro-
duced by the bakery is a ﬁnal good, and a shopper’s bus ride home from the bakery
is a ﬁnal service. Because the purpose of economic activity is the production of ﬁnal
3
Discussion of NIPA adjustments for the underground economy is given in “Taking the Pulse of the
Economy: Measuring GDP” by J. Steven Landefeld, Eugene P . Seskin, and Barbara M. Fraumeni,
Journal of Economic Perspectives 22 (Spring 2008), pp. 193–216. On estimating the size of the under-
ground economy, see Edgar Feige, “Measuring Underground (Unobserved, Non-observed,
Unrecorded) Economies in Transition Countries: Can We Trust GDP?” Journal of Comparative
Economics 36 (June 2008), pp. 287–306.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 27
goods and services, with intermediate goods being but a step along the way, only
ﬁnal goods and services are counted in GDP .
Sometimes the distinction between intermediate goods and final goods is
subtle. For example, is a new lathe sold to a furniture manufacturer an intermedi-
ate good or a ﬁnal good? Although the lathe is used to produce other goods, it is
not used up during the year. Hence it is not an intermediate good; it is a ﬁnal
good. In particular, the lathe is an example of a type of ﬁnal good called a capital
good. Other more general examples of capital goods include factories, ofﬁce build-
ings, equipment, and software. A capital good is a good that is itself produced
(which rules out natural resources such as land) and is used to produce other
goods; however, unlike an intermediate good, a capital good is not used up in the
same period that it is produced. The preparers of the national income accounts
decided to classify capital goods as ﬁnal goods and thus to include their production
in GDP. Their reasoning was that the addition to productive capacity from new
capital goods represents economic activity.
Another subtle distinction between intermediate and ﬁnal goods arises in the
treatment of inventory investment. Inventories are stocks of unsold ﬁnished goods,
goods in process, and raw materials held by ﬁrms. Inventory investment is the
amount by which inventories increase during the year.
4
For example, suppose that
a baker began the year with $1000 worth of ﬂour in her storeroom and that at the
end of the year she is holding $1100 worth of ﬂour. The difference between her
beginning and ending stocks, or $100 worth of ﬂour, equals the baker’s inventory
investment during the year. Even though the ultimate purpose of the baker’s ﬂour
is for making bread, her increase in inventory represents production of ﬂour that is
not used up during the year.
5
As in the case of capital goods, inventory investment
is treated as a ﬁnal good and thus part of GDP because increased inventories on
hand imply greater productive capacity in the future.
In the OrangeInc–JuiceInc example, we showed that total economic activity could
be measured by summing the value added (value of output minus value of purchased
inputs) for each producer. The advantage of the value-added technique is that it
automatically includes ﬁnal goods and excludes intermediate goods from the measure
of total output. If you go back to that example, you will see that, by summing the
value added of the two companies, we obtained a measure of economic activity that
included the value of ﬁnal sales of the two businesses to the public but excluded the
intermediate goods (unprocessed oranges) sold to JuiceInc by OrangeInc.
GNP Versus GDP. Until 1991, most economists working with U.S. data focused
on a measure of economic activity known as gross national product (GNP) rather
than on GDP. However, in 1991, primarily to conform with national income
accounting practices in other major industrialized countries, the Department of
Commerce began to use GDP as its basic measure of economic activity. The
difference between GNP and GDP lies in the treatment of output produced by
capital and labor working outside its home (domestic) country. Speciﬁcally, gross
national product is the market value of ﬁnal goods and services newly produced
28 Part 1 Introduction
4
When inventories decline during the year, inventory investment is negative.
5
Inventory investment is the change in the physical quantity of goods in inventory multiplied by their
price. Changes in the valuation of inventories arising from price changes (capital gains or losses) are
not considered inventory investment.

Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 29
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Natural Resources, the Environment, and the National Income Accounts
Much of any country’s economic well-being flows from natural, rather than
human-made, assets—land, rivers and oceans, natural resources (such as oil and
timber), and indeed the air that everyone breathes. Ideally, for the purposes of
economic and environmental planning, the use and misuse of natural resources
and the environment should be appropriately measured in the national income
accounts. Unfortunately, they are not. There are at least two important conceptual
problems with the way the national income accounts currently handle the
economic use of natural resources and the environment.
1. Natural resource depletion. When an oil driller pumps oil from an under-
ground field, the value of the oil produced is counted as part of the nation’s
GDP; there is no offsetting deduction to account for the fact that nonrenewable
resources are being depleted. In principle, the draining of the oil field can be
thought of as a type of negative inventory investment because in a sense it
reduces the inventory of oil. If it were included in the national income
accounts, this negative inventory investment would reduce the computed
value of GDP.
2. The costs and benefits of pollution control. Imagine that a company has the
following choices: It can produce $100 million worth of output and in the
process pollute the local river by dumping its wastes; alternatively, by using 10%
of its workers to dispose properly of its wastes, it can avoid polluting but will
get only $90 million of output. Under current national income accounting rules,
if the firm chooses to pollute rather than not to pollute, its contribution to GDP
will be larger ($100 million rather than $90 million) because the national income
accounts attach no explicit value to a clean river. In an ideal accounting system,
the economic costs of environmental degradation would be subtracted in the
calculation of a firm’s contribution to output, and activities that improve the
environment—because they provide real economic benefits—would be added to
output.
Discussing the national income accounting implications of resource depletion
and pollution may seem to trivialize these important problems. Actually, because
GDP and related statistics are used continually in policy analyses, abstract ques-
tions of measurement often may turn out to have significant real effects. For
example, economic development experts have expressed concern that some poor
countries, in attempting to raise measured GDP as quickly as possible, have done
so in part by overexploiting their natural resources and harming the environ-
ment. Conceivably, explicitly incorporating “hidden” resource and environmen-
tal costs into ofﬁcial measures of economic growth might cause these policies to
be modified. Similarly, in industrialized countries, political debates about the
environment at times have emphasized the impact on conventionally measured
GDP of proposed pollution control measures, rather than their impact on overall
economic welfare. Better accounting for environmental quality might serve
to refocus these debates to the more relevant question of whether, for any
particular environmental proposal, the benefits (economic and noneconomic)
exceed the costs.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 29
by domestic factors of production during the current period, whereas GDP is
production taking place within a country.
When U.S. capital and labor—also called factors of production—are used abroad,
they produce output and earn income. This output and income are included in U.S.
GNP but not in U.S. GDP because they don’t represent production taking place
within the United States. So, for example, the value of roads built by a U.S.
construction company in Saudi Arabia, as measured by the fees that the construction
company receives from the Saudi government, is counted in U.S. GNP but not in U.S.
GDP . Similarly , when foreign capital or labor is used in the United States, the output
produced and the income earned are part of U.S. GDP (because the production
occurs within the United States) but not of U.S. GNP (they are counted in the foreign
country’s GNP instead). For example, the portion of the value of Japanese cars built
in the United States that is attributable to Japanese capital and management counts
in Japanese GNP and U.S. GDP , but not in U.S. GNP .
We define net factor payments from abroad (NFP) to be income paid to
domestic factors of production by the rest of the world minus income paid to for-
eign factors of production by the domestic economy. Using this concept, we express
the relationship between GDP and GNP as
(2.2)
For the United States, GDP and GNP give similar measures of economic
activity. For example, in 2008 the U.S. GDP was $14,441 billion and the U.S. GNP
was $14,583 billion, a difference of about 1%. The distinction between GNP and
GDP is more important for countries such as Egypt and Turkey that have many
citizens working abroad. The reason is that income earned by workers abroad is
part of a country’s GNP but not its GDP .
The Expenditure Approach to Measuring GDP
A different perspective on the components of GDP is obtained by looking at the
expenditure side of the national income accounts. The expenditure approach
measures GDP as total spending on ﬁnal goods and services produced within a
nation during a speciﬁed period of time. Four major categories of spending are
added to get GDP: consumption, investment, government purchases of goods and
services, and net exports of goods and services. In symbols,
With these symbols, we express the expenditure approach to measuring GDP as
(2.3)
Equation (2.3), like Eq. (2.1), is one of the basic relationships in macroeconomics.
Equation (2.3) is called the income–expenditure identity because it states that
income, Y, equals total expenditure, Recent U.S. data for the four C + I + G + NX.
Y = C + I + G + NX.
NX = net exports of goods and srevices.
G = government purchases of goods and services;
I = investment;
C = consumption;
 = total expenditure;
 = total income
Y = GDP = total production (or output)
GDP = GNP - NFP.

Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 31
categories of spending, along with some major subcategories, are given in Table 2.1.
As you read the rest of this section, you should look at Table 2.1 to get a feel for the
relative sizes of different components of spending in the U.S. economy.
Consumption. Consumption is spending by domestic households on ﬁnal goods
and services, including those produced abroad.
6
It is the largest component of
expenditure, usually accounting for about two-thirds of GDP in the United States.
Consumption expenditures are grouped into three categories:
1. consumer durables, which are long-lived consumer items, such as cars, televi-
sions, furniture, and major appliances (but not houses, which are classiﬁed
under investment);
2. nondurable goods, which are shorter-lived items, such as food, clothing, and fuel; and
3. services, such as education, health care, ﬁnancial services, and transportation.
Investment. Investment includes both spending for new capital goods, called
ﬁxed investment, and increases in ﬁrms’ inventory holdings, called inventory
investment. Fixed investment in turn has two major components:
1. business ﬁxed investment, which is spending by businesses on structures (facto-
ries, warehouses, and ofﬁce buildings, for example) and equipment (such as
machines, vehicles, computers, and furniture) and software; and
6
Later, we subtract imports from total expenditures and add exports to calculate total spending on the
goods and services produced by the domestic economy.

2. residential investment, which is spending on the construction of new houses
and apartment buildings. Houses and apartment buildings are treated as cap-
ital goods because they provide a service (shelter) over a long period of time.
Like consumption, investment includes spending on foreign-produced goods.
Overall, ﬁxed investment in the United States usually is about one-sixth of GDP .
As we have mentioned, increases in inventories are included in investment
spending, regardless of why inventories rose. In particular, if a ﬁrm produces
goods that it can’t sell, the resulting rise in inventories counts as investment by the
firm. For the purposes of national income accounting, the firm has, in effect,
purchased the unsold goods from itself. This accounting rule is useful because it
guarantees that production and expenditure will always be equal in the national
income accounts. Anything that is produced must, by deﬁnition, either be bought
by a customer or “purchased” by the ﬁrm itself.
Government Purchases of Goods and Services. Government purchases of
goods and services, which include any expenditure by the government for a
currently produced good or service, foreign or domestic, is the third major
component of spending. Government purchases in the United States recently
have been about one-ﬁfth of GDP. Note in Table 2.1 that in the United States the
majority of government purchases are made by state and local governments, not
the Federal government.
Not all the checks written by the government are for purchases of current
goods and services. Transfers, a category that includes government payments for
Social Security and Medicare benefits,
7
unemployment insurance, welfare
payments, and so on, are payments (primarily to individuals) by the government
that are not made in exchange for current goods or services. As a result, they are
excluded from the government purchases category and are not counted in GDP
as calculated by the expenditure approach. Similarly, interest payments on the
national debt are not counted as part of government purchases.
Much like the distinction between private-sector consumption and investment,
some part of government purchases goes toward current needs (such as employee
salaries) and some is devoted to acquiring capital goods (such as ofﬁce buildings).
In the U.S. national income and product accounts, government spending on capi-
tal goods (buildings, equipment, and software) has been broken out from other
government purchases. Investment by the government is fairly sizable—more than
$400 billion annually in recent years, or about one-ﬁfth of the amount invested
annually by the private sector. When we speak of “investment” in the national
income accounts, however, we are generally referring to investment by the private
sector, I; for simplicity, we include government investment with other government
purchases of goods and services, G.
Net Exports. Net exports are exports minus imports. As discussed in Chapter 1,
exports are the goods and services produced within a country that are purchased
32 Part 1 Introduction
7
Although it might seem that Medicare beneﬁts are a current expenditure by the government and not
a transfer, in the NIPAs the medical expenditure is considered consumption spending by households,
and the government payment to cover the medical expenditure is a transfer payment from the
government to the household.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 32
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 33
by foreigners; imports are the goods and services produced abroad that are
purchased by a country’s residents. Net exports are positive if exports are greater
than imports and negative if imports exceed exports.
Exports are added to total spending because they represent spending (by
foreigners) on ﬁnal goods and services produced in a country. Imports are sub-
tracted from total spending because consumption, investment, and government
purchases are defined to include imported goods and services. Subtracting
imports ensures that total spending, C + I + G + NX, reﬂects spending only on
output produced in the country. For example, an increase in imports may mean
that Americans are buying Japanese cars instead of American cars. For ﬁxed total
spending by domestic residents, therefore, an increase in imports lowers spending
on domestic production.
The Income Approach to Measuring GDP
The third and ﬁnal way to measure GDP is the income approach. It calculates GDP
by adding the incomes received by producers, including proﬁts, and taxes paid to
the government. A key part of the income approach is a concept known as nation-
al income. National income is the sum of eight types of income (see Table 2.2 for
recent U.S. data).
1. Compensation of employees. Compensation of employees is the income of
workers (excluding the self-employed) and includes wages, salaries, employee
beneﬁts (including contributions by employers to pension plans), and employer
contributions to Social Security. As you can see from Table 2.2, compensation of
employees is the largest component of national income, accounting for 55.7% of
GDP in 2008.
2. Proprietors’ income. Proprietors’ income is the income of the nonincorpo-
rated self-employed. Because many self-employed people own some capital (exam-
ples are a farmer’s tractor or a dentist’s X-ray machine), proprietors’ income
includes both labor income and capital income. Proprietors’ income was 7.7% of
GDP in 2008.
3. Rental income of persons. Rental income of persons, a small item, is the
income earned by individuals who own land or structures that they rent to others.
Some miscellaneous types of income, such as royalty income paid to authors,
recording artists, and others, also are included in this category. Rental income of
persons was about 1.5% of GDP in 2008.
8
4. Corporate proﬁts. Corporate proﬁts are the proﬁts earned by corporations
and represent the remainder of corporate revenue after wages, interest, rents, and
other costs have been paid. Corporate proﬁts are used to pay taxes levied on cor-
porations, such as the corporate income tax, and to pay dividends to shareholders.
The rest of corporate proﬁts after taxes and dividends, called retained earnings, are
kept by the corporations. Corporate proﬁts generally are a modest fraction of GDP
(9.4% of GDP in 2008), but the amount of proﬁts earned by corporations may
change dramatically from year to year or even from quarter to quarter.
8
Rental income of persons is a tiny fraction of GDP because it represents net rental income, or rents
received minus the cost of replacing worn-out or depreciated structures. Also, rental income of persons
does not include all rents paid in the economy because it excludes rents received by corporations.

5. Net interest. Net interest is interest earned by individuals from businesses
and foreign sources minus interest paid by individuals. Net interest has varied
from 4% to 8% of GDP each year over the past 25 years.
6. Taxes on production and imports. Taxes on production and imports include
indirect business taxes, such as sales and excise taxes, that are paid by businesses
to Federal, state, and local governments, as well as customs duties and taxes on res-
idential real estate and motor vehicle licenses paid by households. These taxes
have averaged about 7% of GDP for the past 25 years.
7. Business current transfer payments (net). Business current transfer payments
are payments made by businesses to individuals or governments or foreigners, but
not for wages or taxes or as payment for services. Instead, such transactions as
charitable donations, insurance payments, FDIC insurance premiums paid by
banks, and legal settlements are covered by this category of income. Business cur-
rent transfer payments have been between 0.5% and 0.9% of GDP each year for the
past 25 years.
8. Current surplus of government enterprises. Current surplus of government
enterprises is essentially the proﬁt of businesses that are owned by governments,
such as water, electric, and sewer companies, trash companies, mass transit ﬁrms,
and housing ﬁrms. Current surplus of government enterprises is often negative
when the ﬁrms suffer losses, as has occurred in 7 of the past 25 years, though the
losses have never been more than 0.11% of GDP .
In addition to the eight components of national income just described, three
other items need to be accounted for to obtain GDP:
■ statistical discrepancy;
■ depreciation; and
■ net factor payments.

Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 35
Statistical discrepancy arises because data on income are compiled from dif-
ferent sources than data on production; the production measure minus the income
measure equals the statistical discrepancy. Thus, a positive statistical discrepancy
means that the income measure adds up to less than the production measure.
National income plus the statistical discrepancy equals net national product
(NNP), as indicated in Table 2.2.
Depreciation (also known as consumption of fixed capital) is the value of
the capital that wears out during the period over which economic activity is
being measured.
9
In the calculation of the components of national income
(specifically, proprietors’ income, corporate profits, and rental income), depre-
ciation is subtracted from total, or gross, income. Thus, to compute the total or
gross amount of income, we must add back in depreciation. The sum of net
national product and depreciation is gross national product (GNP). Gross
national product and gross domestic product are called gross because they mea-
sure the nation’s total production or output of goods and services without sub-
tracting depreciation.
As we discussed earlier, to go from GNP to GDP we have to subtract net factor
payments from abroad, NFP (see Eq. 2.2). As we have already mentioned and as
you can see from Table 2.2, for the United States net factor payments are relatively
small and so GDP and GNP are very close.
Private Sector and Government Sector Income. In this section we have
measured economic activity as the sum of all the incomes received in an
economy. Sometimes, however, economists need to know how much of total
income was received by the private sector (households and businesses) and how
much accrues to the government sector, which in the United States consists of
Federal, state, and local governments. For example, in trying to predict the
demand for consumer goods, focusing on the income available to the private
sector might be more useful than focusing on the income of the economy as a
whole.
The income of the private sector, known as private disposable income, mea-
sures the amount of income the private sector has available to spend. In general, as
for an individual family, the disposable income of the private sector as a whole
equals income received from private-sector activities, plus payments received by
the private sector from the government, minus taxes paid to the government. The
precise deﬁnition is
(2.4)
where
T = taxes.
INT = interest payments on the government's debt;
TR = transfers received from the government;
NFP = net factor payments from abroad;
Y = gross domestic product (GDP);
private disposable income = Y + NFP + TR + INT - T,
9
Depreciation (consumption of ﬁxed capital) includes both capital that physically wears out and capi-
tal that is scrapped because it is no longer economically useful. For instance, still-functioning comput-
ers that are scrapped because they have been made obsolete by newer models would be included in
depreciation.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 35
As you can see from Eq. (2.4), private disposable income equals private
sector income earned at home (GDP) and abroad (net factor payments from
abroad, NFP);
10
plus payments to the private sector from the government sector
(transfers, TR, and interest on the government debt, INT); minus taxes paid to
the government, T.
The part of GDP that is not at the disposal of the private sector is the net
income of the government sector. Net government income equals taxes paid by the
private sector, T, minus payments from the government to the private sector (trans-
fers, TR, and interest payments on the government debt, INT):
(2.5)
Adding Eqs. (2.4) and (2.5) yields the sum of private disposable income and net
government income, Y + NFP, which is gross national product.
2.3 Saving and Wealth
If you wanted to assess the economic situation of a household, the current income
of the household would be an important piece of information. However, someone
with a high current income isn’t necessarily better off economically than someone
with a low current income. For example, a retired tycoon who has no current earn-
ings but owns real estate worth $10 million probably is economically better off than
a newly graduated doctor with a high salary but heavy debts left over from medical
school. To determine how well off a household is, in addition to knowing current
income, you also need to know what the household owns (its assets) and owes (its
liabilities). The value of assets minus the value of liabilities is called wealth.
As for a household, the economic well-being of a country depends not only on
its income but also on its wealth. The wealth of an entire nation is called national
wealth.
An important determinant of wealth is the rate of saving: A family that puts
aside a quarter of its income each month will accumulate wealth much more quick-
ly than a family with the same income that saves only 2% of its income. Similarly , the
rate at which national wealth increases depends on the rate at which individuals,
businesses, and governments in the economy save. Thus rates of saving and wealth
accumulation are closely related.
In this section we present some concepts of aggregate saving and wealth and
examine the relationships among them. Our main interest here is measurement.
Questions such as what determines the rate of saving in a country are covered in
later chapters.
Measures of Aggregate Saving
In general, the saving of any economic unit is the unit’s current income minus its
spending on current needs. The saving rate of an economic unit is its saving divided
by its income. From a macroeconomic perspective, three important measures of
saving are private saving, government saving, and national saving. Summary table
1 outlines the deﬁnitions of each measure.
net government income = T - TR - INT.

SUMMARY 1
Measures of Aggregate Saving
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 37
Private Saving. The saving of the private sector, known as private saving,
equals private disposable income minus consumption. Using the deﬁnition of
private disposable income from Eq. (2.4), we have
(2.6)
where S
pvt
is private saving. Consumption is subtracted from private disposable
income to obtain private saving because consumption represents the private
sector’s spending to meet current needs. Investment, although part of private
sector spending, is not subtracted from private disposable income because capital
goods are purchased to enhance future productive capacity rather than to satisfy
current needs. The private saving rate is private saving divided by private dispos-
able income.
Government Saving. Government saving is deﬁned as net government income,
Eq. (2.5), less government purchases of goods and services. Using S
govt
for
government saving, we write this deﬁnition of government saving as
(2.7)
Equation (2.7) treats total government purchases, G, as the government’s
spending to meet current needs. Thus the deﬁnition of government saving ﬁts the
general deﬁnition of saving as income less spending on current needs.
However, as we discussed earlier, not all government purchases are in fact
devoted to satisfying current needs; some part of G is devoted to the acquisition
of long-lived capital, such as schools, highways, and dams. The national income
and product accounts break total government purchases into the portion devot-
ed to current needs (referred to as government consumption
11
) and the portion
spent on long-lived capital goods (referred to as government investment). Under
= (T - TR - INT) - G.

The measure of government consumption includes depreciation of the government’s capital goods.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 37
this breakdown, government saving could be deﬁned as net government income
less government consumption only, rather than net government income less all
government purchases. This alternative approach would increase the amount of
measured saving and investment in the U.S. economy by the amount of govern-
ment investment, an amount exceeding $400 billion per year.
12
Although the new deﬁnition of government saving is conceptually more correct,
for most analyses in this book, keeping track of government consumption and gov-
ernment investment separately is an unnecessary complication. To keep things simple,
we usually ignore government investment, assuming that government purchases are
made up entirely of government consumption. With this assumption, we can use the
traditional deﬁnition of government saving, Eq. (2.7). When considering issues such
as the government budget deﬁcit, however, keep in mind that, in fact, some govern-
ment spending is devoted to building or acquiring long-lived capital goods.
Another, probably more familiar, name for government saving is the govern-
ment budget surplus. The government budget surplus equals government receipts
minus government outlays. Government receipts equal tax revenue, T.
Government outlays are the sum of government purchases of goods and services,
G, transfers, TR, and interest payments on government debt, INT. Thus the gov-
ernment budget surplus equals which, as you can see from 
Eq. (2.7), is the same as government saving.
When government receipts are less than government outlays, the difference
between outlays and receipts is known as the government budget deﬁcit. Thus,
when the government runs a budget deficit, with its outlays greater than its
receipts, government saving is negative.
National Saving. National saving, or the saving of the economy as a whole,
equals private saving plus government saving. Using the definitions of private
and government saving, Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7), we obtain national saving, S:
(2.8)
Equation (2.8) shows that national saving equals the total income of the economy,
(which equals GNP), minus spending to satisfy current needs
(consumption, C, and government purchases, G).
The Uses of Private Saving
How is private saving in an economy put to use? Private saving is used to fund
new capital investment, provide the resources the government needs to ﬁnance its
budget deﬁcits, and acquire assets from or lend to foreigners.
To derive an important identity that illustrates the uses of private saving, we
ﬁrst use the income–expenditure identity (Eq. 2.3) and substitute 
for Y in the expression for national saving (Eq. 2.8):
S =1C + I + G + NX2 + NFP - C - G.
C + I + G + NX
Y + NFP
= Y + NFP - C - G.
= (Y + NFP - T + TR + INT - C) + (T - TR - INT - G)
S = S
pvt
+ S

T - (G + TR + INT),

Note that, by similar reasoning, household spending on cars and other long-lived consumer
durables should not be subtracted from private disposable income in the calculation of private
saving; however, in practice they are subtracted.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 38
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 39
Simplifying this expression, we obtain
(2.9)
The expression for national saving in Eq. (2.9) contains the term NX + NFP,
which is the sum of net exports and net factor payments, and is called the current
account balance, CA.
13
The current account balance equals payments received
from abroad in exchange for currently produced goods and services (including
factor services), minus the analogous payments made to foreigners by the domes-
tic economy. Substituting CA for NX + NFP in Eq. (2.9), we obtain
(2.10)
We now have an expression for national saving, S; our goal is an expression for
private saving, S
pvt
. Equation (2.8) shows that private saving, S
pvt
, equals national
saving, S, minus government saving, S
govt
. Then, subtracting S
govt
from both sides
of Eq. (2.10), we get
(2.11)
where 
govt
is the government budget deﬁcit.
Equation (2.11) is another important macroeconomic identity, called the uses-
of-saving identity. It states that an economy’s private saving is used in three ways.
1. Investment (I). Firms borrow from private savers to ﬁnance the construction
and purchase of new capital (including residential capital) and inventory investment.
2. The government budget deﬁcit (-S
govt
). When the government runs a budget
deﬁcit (so that S
govt
is negative and -S
govt
is positive), it must borrow from private
savers to cover the difference between outlays and receipts.
3. The current account balance (CA). When the U.S. current account balance is
positive, foreigners’ receipts of payments from the United States are not sufﬁcient
to cover the payments they make to the United States. To make up the difference,
foreigners must either borrow from U.S. private savers or sell to U.S. savers some
of their assets, such as land, factories, stocks, and bonds. Thus ﬁnancing the
current account balance is a use of a country’s private saving.
In contrast, when the U.S. current account balance is negative, as it was during
most of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, U.S. receipts of payments from foreigners are
not sufﬁcient to cover U.S. payments to foreigners. To offset this excess of payments
over receipts, the United States must borrow from foreigners or sell to foreigners
some U.S. assets. In this case, foreigners use their saving to lend to the United
States or to acquire U.S. assets.
14
Relating Saving and Wealth
Saving is a key economic variable because it is closely related to the rate of wealth
accumulation. In the rest of this section we discuss the relationship of saving and
wealth. To do so, however, we must ﬁrst introduce the concept of stocks versus ﬂows.
-S
S
pvt
= I + (-S
govt
) + CA,
S = I + CA.
S = I +1NX + NFP2.
13
Actually, the current account balance also includes the term net unilateral transfers, which measures
transfers between countries such as private gifts or ofﬁcial foreign aid (see Chapter 5). In our analysis
we generally ignore this term.
14
The current account and its relationship to international borrowing and lending are discussed in
greater detail in Chapter 5.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 39
Stocks and Flows. The economic variables we have discussed so far in this
chapter—such as GDP and the various types of expenditure, income, and
saving—are measured per unit of time (for example, per quarter or per year). For
instance, annual GDP ﬁgures measure the economy’s production per year.
Variables that are measured per unit of time are called ﬂow variables.
In contrast, some economic variables, called stock variables, are deﬁned at a
point in time. Examples of stock variables include the amount of money in your
bank account on September 15 of this year and the total value of all houses in the
United States on January 1, 2010.
In many applications, a ﬂow variable is the rate of change in a stock variable.
A classic example is a bathtub with water ﬂowing in from a faucet. The amount of
water in the tub at any moment is a stock variable. The units of a stock variable
(gallons, in this case) don’t have a time dimension. The rate at which water enters
the tub is a ﬂow variable; its units (gallons per minute) have a time dimension. In
this case the ﬂow equals the rate of change of the stock.
Wealth and Saving as Stock and Flow. Saving and wealth are related to each
other in much the same way that the ﬂow and stock of water in a bathtub are
related. The wealth of any economic unit (a household, ﬁrm, or government), also
called net worth, is its assets (the things that it owns, including IOUs from other
economic units) minus its liabilities (what it owes to other units). Wealth is
measured in dollars at a point in time and is a stock variable. Saving is measured
in dollars per unit time and is a ﬂow variable. Because saving takes the form of an
accumulation of assets or a reduction in liabilities (for example, if saving is used
to pay off debts), it adds to wealth just as water ﬂowing into a bathtub adds to the
stock of water.
National Wealth. National wealth is the total wealth of the residents of a
country. National wealth consists of two parts: (1) the country’s domestic physical
assets, such as its stock of capital goods and land;
15
and (2) its net foreign assets.
The net foreign assets of a country equal the country’s foreign assets (foreign
stocks, bonds, and factories owned by domestic residents) minus its foreign
liabilities (domestic physical and ﬁnancial assets owned by foreigners). Net foreign
assets are part of national wealth because they represent claims on foreigners that
are not offset by foreigners’ claims on the domestic economy.
Domestic ﬁnancial assets held by domestic residents are not part of national
wealth because the value of any domestic ﬁnancial asset is offset by a domestic
ﬁnancial liability. For example, a checking account of a U.S. resident in a U.S. bank
is an asset for the depositor but a liability for the bank; it thus does not represent
wealth for the economy as a whole. In contrast, a U.S. resident’s checking account
in a foreign bank has no corresponding domestic liability (it is a liability of a for-
eigner) and so is part of U.S. national wealth.
National wealth can change in two ways over time. First, the value of the existing
assets or liabilities that make up national wealth may change. For example, the dra-
matic increase in the stock market during the 1990s increased U.S. national wealth.
40 Part 1 Introduction
15
In principle, national wealth should also include the value of the skills and training of the country’s
residents—what economists call human capital. In practice, because of measurement problems, human
capital is not usually included in measures of national wealth.
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 40
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 41
The wearing out or depreciation of physical assets, which corresponds to a drop in
the value of those assets, reduces national wealth.
The second way that national wealth can change is through national saving.
Over any particular period of time, with the value of existing assets and liabilities
held constant, each extra dollar of national saving adds a dollar to national wealth.
That is,
which you will recognize as Eq. (2.10). This equation shows that national saving
has two uses: (1) to increase the stock of domestic physical capital through invest-
ment, I, and (2) to increase the nation’s stock of net foreign assets by lending to for-
eigners or acquiring foreign assets in an amount equal to the current account
balance, CA. But each dollar by which domestic physical assets or net foreign assets
increase is a dollar by which national wealth increases. Thus, as we claimed,
increases in national saving increase national wealth dollar for dollar. As in the
example of water flowing into a bathtub, the more rapid the flow of national
saving, the more quickly the stock of national wealth will rise.
How do national saving and investment in the United States compare to that in
other countries? The United States is a relatively low-saving country , compared with
other industrialized nations. Investment is also relatively low in the United States,
according to the ofﬁcial statistics.
16
However, investment rates in the United States
are generally higher than saving rates. Using the relationship , we see
that, if investment, I, is greater than national saving, S, then the current account
balance, CA, must be negative. As we mentioned earlier, the U.S. current account has
indeed been in deﬁcit nearly every year since 1980. In contrast, high-saving countries
such as China have typically had investment rates lower than their saving rates,
resulting in consistently positive current account balances for those countries.
2.4 Real GDP , Price Indexes, and Inflation
All of the key macroeconomic variables that we have discussed so far in this
chapter—GDP, the components of expenditure and income, national wealth, and
saving—are measured in terms of current market values. Such variables are called
nominal variables. The advantage of using market values to measure economic
activity is that it allows summing of different types of goods and services.
However, a problem with measuring economic activity in nominal terms arises
if you want to compare the values of an economic variable—GDP , for example—at
two different points in time. If the current market value of the goods and services
included in GDP changes over time, you can’t tell whether this change reﬂects
changes in the quantities of goods and services produced, changes in the prices of
goods and services, or a combination of these factors. For example, a large increase
in the current market value of GDP might mean that a country has greatly expand-
ed its production of goods and services, or it might mean that the country has expe-
rienced inﬂation, which raised the prices of goods and services.
S = I + CA
S = I + CA,
16
Some economists have suggested that the low U.S. saving and investment rates reﬂect various
measurement problems as much as fundamental differences in behavior. See, for example, William
Dewald and Michael Ulan, “Appreciating U.S. Saving and Investment,” Business Economics, January
1992, pp. 42–46.

Real GDP
Economists have devised methods for breaking down changes in nominal variables
into the part owing to changes in physical quantities and the part owing to changes
in prices. Consider the numerical example in Table 2.3, which gives production and
price data for an economy that produces two types of goods: computers and bicy-
cles. The data are presented for two different years. In year 1, the value of GDP is
$46,000 (5 computers worth $1200 each and 200 bicycles worth $200 each). In year 2,
the value of GDP is $66,000 (10 computers worth $600 each and 250 bicycles worth
$240 each), which is 43.5% higher than the value of GDP in year 1. This 43.5%
increase in nominal GDP does not reﬂect either a 43.5% increase in physical output
or a 43.5% increase in prices. Instead, it reﬂects changes in both output and prices.
How much of the 43.5% increase in nominal output is attributable to an
increase in physical output? A simple way to remove the effects of price changes,
and thus to focus on changes in quantities of output, is to measure the value of pro-
duction in each year by using the prices from some base year. For this example, let’s
choose year 1 as the base year. Using the prices from year 1 ($1200 per computer
and $200 per bicycle) to value the production in year 2 (10 computers and 250
bicycles) yields a value of $62,000, as shown in Table 2.4. We say that $62,000 is the
value of real GDP in year 2, measured using the prices of year 1.
In general, an economic variable that is measured by the prices of a base year
is called a real variable. Real economic variables measure the physical quantity of
economic activity. Speciﬁcally, real GDP, also called constant-dollar GDP, measures
the physical volume of an economy’s ﬁnal production using the prices of a base
year. Nominal GDP, also called current-dollar GDP, is the dollar value of an econ-
omy’s ﬁnal output measured at current market prices. Thus nominal GDP in year 2
for our example is $66,000, which we computed earlier using current (that is,
year 2) prices to value output.
What is the value of real GDP in year 1? Continuing to treat year 1 as the base
year, use the prices of year 1 ($1200 per computer and $200 per bicycle) to value
production. The production of 5 computers and 200 bicycles has a value of $46,000.
Thus the value of real GDP in year 1 is the same as the value of nominal GDP in
year 1. This result is a general one: Because current prices and base-year prices are
the same in the base year, real and nominal values are always the same in the base
year. Speciﬁcally, real GDP and nominal GDP are equal in the base year.

Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 43
Now we are prepared to calculate the increase in the physical production from
year 1 to year 2. Real GDP is designed to measure the physical quantity of pro-
duction. Because real GDP in year 2 is $62,000, and real GDP in year 1 is $46,000,
output, as measured by real GDP , is 34.8% higher in year 2 than in year 1.
Price Indexes
We have seen how to calculate the portion of the change in nominal GDP owing to
a change in physical quantities. Now we turn our attention to the change in prices
by using price indexes. A price index is a measure of the average level of prices for
some speciﬁed set of goods and services, relative to the prices in a speciﬁed base
year. For example, the GDP deﬂator is a price index that measures the overall
level of prices of goods and services included in GDP , and is deﬁned by the formula
The GDP deﬂator (divided by 100) is the amount by which nominal GDP must
be divided, or “deﬂated,” to obtain real GDP. In our example, we have already
computed nominal GDP and real GDP, so we can now calculate the GDP deﬂator
by rewriting the preceding formula as
GDP deflator = 100 * nominal GDP/real GDP.
real GDP = nominal GDP /(GDP deflator/100).

44 Part 1 Introduction
In year 1 (the base year in our example), nominal GDP and real GDP are equal,
so the GDP deﬂator equals 100. This result is an example of the general principle
that the GDP deﬂator always equals 100 in the base year. In year 2, nominal GDP
is $66,000 (see Table 2.3) and real GDP is $62,000 (see Table 2.4), so the GDP deﬂa-
tor in year 2 is 100 * $66,000/$62,000 = 106.5, which is 6.5% higher than the value
of the GDP deﬂator in year 1. Thus the overall level of prices, as measured by the
GDP deﬂator, is 6.5% higher in year 2 than in year 1.
The measurement of real GDP and the GDP deﬂator depends on the choice of
a base year. “In Touch with Data and Research: The Computer Revolution and
Chain-Weighted GDP” demonstrates that the choice of a base year can have im-
portant effects on the calculated growth of real output, which in turn affects the
calculated change in the price level.
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The Computer Revolution and Chain-Weighted GDP
The widespread use of computers has revolutionized business, education, and leisure
throughout much of the developed world. The fraction of the real spending in the
United States devoted to computers quintupled between the mid-1980s and the mid-
1990s,* while computer prices fell by more than 10% per year on average.
†
The sharp
increase in the real quantity of computers and the sharp decline in computer prices
highlight the problem of choosing a base year in calculating the growth of real GDP .
We can use the example in Tables 2.3 and 2.4, which includes a large increase in
the quantity of computers coupled with a sharp decrease in computer prices, to
illustrate the problem. We have shown that, when we treat year 1 as the base year,
real output increases by 34.8% from year 1 to year 2. However, as we will see in this
box using Table 2.4, we get a substantially different measure of real output growth if
we treat year 2 as the base year. Treating year 2 as the base year means that we use the
prices of year 2 to value output. Speciﬁcally, each computer is valued at $600 and
each bicycle is valued at $240. Thus the real value of the 5 computers and 200 bicycles
produced in year 1 is $51,000. If we continue to treat year 2 as the base year, the real
value of output in year 2 is the same as the nominal value of output, which we have
already calculated to be $66,000. Thus, by treating year 2 as the base year, we see real
output grow from $51,000 in year 1 to $66,000 in year 2, an increase of 29.4%.
Let’s summarize our calculations so far. Using year 1 as the base year, the calculated
growth of output is 34.8%, but using year 2 as the base year, the calculated growth of
output is only 29.4%. Why does this difference arise? In this example, the quantity of
computers grows by 100% (from 5 to 10) and the quantity of bicycles grows by 25%
(from 200 to 250) from year 1 to year 2. The computed growth of overall output—34.8%
using year 1 as the base year or 29.4% using year 2 as the base year—is between the
growth rates of the two individual goods. The overall growth rate is a sort of weighted
average of the growth rates of the individual goods. When year 1 is the base year, we use
year 1 prices to value output, and in year 1 computers are much more expensive than

bicycles. Thus the growth of overall output is closer to the very high growth rate of com-
puters than when the growth rate is computed using year 2 as the base year.
Which base year is the “right” one to use? There is no clear reason to prefer one
over the other. To deal with this problem, in 1996 the Bureau of Economic Analysis
introduced chain-weighted indexes to measure real GDP. Chain-weighted real
GDP represents a mathematical compromise between using year 1 and using year
2 as the base year. The growth rate of real GDP computed using chain-weighted
real GDP is a sort of average of the growth rate computed using year 1 as the base
year and the growth rate computed using year 2 as the base year. (In this example,
the growth rate of real GDP using chain-weighting is 32.1%, but we will not go
through the details of that calculation here.)
‡
Before the Bureau of Economic Analysis adopted chain-weighting, it used 1987
as the base year to compute real GDP . As time passed, it became necessary to update
the base year so that the prices used to compute real GDP would reﬂect the true
values of various goods being produced. Every time the base year was changed, the
Bureau of Economic Analysis had to calculate new historical data for real GDP.
Chain-weighting effectively updates the base year automatically . The annual growth
rate for a given year is computed using that year and the preceding year as base
years. As time goes on, there is no need to recompute historical growth rates of real
GDP using new base years. Nevertheless, chain-weighted real GDP has a peculiar
feature. Although the income–expenditure identity, , always
holds exactly in nominal terms, for technical reasons, this relationship need not
hold exactly when GDP and its components are measured in real terms when chain-
weighting is used. Because the discrepancy is usually small, we assume in this book
that the income–expenditure identity holds in both real and nominal terms.
Chain-weighting was introduced to resolve the problem of choosing a given
year as a base year in calculating real GDP. How large a difference does chain-
weighting make in the face of the rapidly increasing production of computers and
plummeting computer prices? Using 1987 as the base year, real GDP in the fourth
quarter of 1994 was computed to be growing at a 5.1% annual rate. Using chain-
weighting, real GDP growth during this quarter was a less impressive 4.0%. The
Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that computers account for about three-
ﬁfths of the difference between these two growth rates.**

The Consumer Price Index. The GDP deﬂator measures the average level of
prices of goods and services included in GDP. The consumer price index, or
CPI, measures the prices of consumer goods. Unlike the GDP deﬂator, which is
calculated quarterly, the CPI is available monthly. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
constructs the CPI by sending people out each month to ﬁnd the current prices
of a ﬁxed list, or “basket,” of consumer goods and services, including many
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 45
46 Part 1 Introduction
speciﬁc items of food, clothing, housing, and fuel. The CPI for that month is
then calculated as 100 times the current cost of the basket of consumer items
divided by the cost of the same basket of items in the reference base period.
The calculation of the consumer price index requires the use of a reference
base period, for comparing prices over time, and an expenditure base period, for
determining the basket of goods used in the index. Currently the reference base
period is 1982–1984, which means that the consumer price index is constructed so
it averages 100 for the three-year period from January 1982 to December 1984. So,
if the CPI averages 215 in 2008, that means the average level of consumer prices is
115% higher than it was in the 1982–1984 period.
The expenditure base period for the CPI is the period on which the Bureau of
Labor Statistics bases the basket of goods, which is currently 2005–2006. A survey
of consumers’ expenditure patterns over the years 2005–2006 is used to weight the
goods and services for constructing the CPI. Currently the reference base period
differs from the expenditure base period. The government updates the expenditure
base period every few years and does not want to recalculate the past values of the
index by changing the reference base period. Even though the government updates
the expenditure base period every few years, there is reason to think that the CPI
inﬂation rate is biased upward, as discussed in “In Touch with Data and Research:
Does CPI Inﬂation Overstate Increases in the Cost of Living?”
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Does CPI Inflation Overstate Increases in the Cost of Living?
In 1995–1996 a government commission, headed by Michael Boskin of Stanford
University, prepared a report on the accuracy of ofﬁcial inﬂation measures. The
commission concluded that inﬂation as measured by the CPI may overstate true
increases in the cost of living by as much as 1–2 percentage points per year. In other
words, if the ofﬁcial inﬂation rate is 3% per year, the “true” inﬂation rate may well
be only 1%–2% per year.
Why might increases in the CPI overstate the actual rate at which the cost of
living rises? One reason is the difﬁculty that government statisticians face in trying
to measure changes in the quality of goods. For example, if the design of an air con-
ditioner is improved so that it can put out 10% more cold air without an increased
use of electricity, then a 10% increase in the price of the air conditioner should not
be considered inﬂation; although paying 10% more, the consumer is also receiving
10% more cooling capacity. However, if government statisticians fail to account for
the improved quality of the air conditioner and simply note its 10% increase in
price, the price change will be incorrectly interpreted as inﬂation.
Although measuring the output of an air conditioner isn’t difﬁcult, for some
products (especially services) quality change is hard to measure. For example, by
what percentage does the availability of 24-hour cash machines improve the qual-
ity of banking services? To the extent that the CPI fails to account for quality
improvements in the goods and services people use, inﬂation will be overstated.
This overstatement is called the quality adjustment bias.
Another problem with CPI inﬂation as a measure of cost of living increases can
be illustrated by the following example. Suppose that consumers like chicken and
turkey about equally well and in the base year consume equal amounts of each. But
M02_ABEL4529_07_SE_C02.QXD  12/9/09  3:26 PM  Page 46
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 47
then for some reason the price of chicken rises sharply, leading consumers to switch
to eating turkey almost exclusively. Because consumers are about equally satisﬁed
with chicken and turkey, this switch doesn’t make them signiﬁcantly worse off;
their true cost of living has not been affected much by the rise in the price of chick-
en. However, the ofﬁcial CPI, which measures the cost of buying the base-year
basket of goods and services, will register a signiﬁcant increase when the price of
chicken skyrockets. Thus the rise in the CPI exaggerates the true increase in the cost
of living. The problem is that the CPI is based on the assumption that consumers
purchase a basket of goods and services that is ﬁxed over time, ignoring the fact
that consumers can (and do) substitute cheaper goods or services for more expen-
sive ones. This source of overstatement of the true increase in the cost of living is
called the substitution bias.
If ofﬁcial inﬂation measures do, in fact, overstate true inﬂation, there are impor-
tant implications. First, if cost of living increases are overstated, then increases in
important quantities such as real family income (the purchasing power of a typical
family’s income) are correspondingly understated. As a result, the bias in the CPI
may lead to too gloomy a view of how well the U.S. economy has done over the
past few decades. Second, many government payments and taxes are tied, or
indexed, to the CPI. Social Security beneﬁts, for example, automatically increase
each year by the same percentage as the CPI. If CPI inflation overstates true
inﬂation, then Social Security recipients have been receiving greater beneﬁt increas-
es than necessary to compensate them for increases in the cost of living. If Social
Security and other transfer program payments were set to increase at the rate of
“true” inﬂation, rather than at the CPI inﬂation rate, the Federal government would
save billions of dollars each year.
In response to the Boskin commission’s report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) made several technical changes in the way it constructs the CPI to reduce
substitution bias. These changes have reduced the overstatement of the “true”
inﬂation rate by 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points per year. However, the substitution
bias was originally larger than the Boskin Commission’s estimate, so the bias in the
inﬂation rate is still 1% per year, or perhaps even higher.
Note: For a detailed discussion of biases in the CPI, see David Lebow and Jeremy Rudd, “Measure-
ment Error in the Consumer Price Index: Where Do We Stand?” Journal of Economic Literature, March
2003, pp. 159–201; and Robert J. Gordon, “The Boskin Commission Report: A Retrospective One
Decade Later,” NBER Working Paper No. 12311, June 2006.
Inflation. An important variable that is measured with price indexes is the
inﬂation rate. The inﬂation rate equals the percentage rate of increase in the price
index per period. Thus, if the GDP deﬂator rises from 100 in one year to 105 the
next, the inﬂation rate between the two years is (105 - 100)/100 = 5/100 = 0.05 = 5%
per year. If in the third year the GDP deﬂator is 112, the inﬂation rate between the
second and third years is (112 - 105)/105 = 7/105 = 0.0667 = 6.67% per year. More

APPLICATION
The Federal Reserve’s Preferred Inflation Measures
Our discussion of price indexes describes the GDP deﬂator and the consumer price
index (CPI). But the Federal Reserve (the Fed, for short), in reporting its forecasts
of the economy, focuses on a different measure of prices: the personal consumption
expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the measure of consumer prices in the
national income and product accounts. The Fed announced in November 2007 that
it would forecast inﬂation and other variables four times each year (instead of
twice each year as it had done before). It also said that it would forecast both the
overall inﬂation rate in the PCE price index and the core inﬂation rate of the same
index, which excludes food and energy prices.
In the 1990s, the Fed provided forecasts of the inﬂation rate based on the CPI.
But the Boskin Commission’s ﬁnding (see “In Touch with Data and Research: Does
CPI Inﬂation Overstate Increases in the Cost of Living?” p. 46) that the CPI measure
of inﬂation substantially overstates increases in the cost of living caused the Fed to
move away from focusing on the CPI and to pay more attention to the PCE price
index.
17
Because the PCE price index is based on actual household expenditures on

various goods and services, it avoids the substitution bias inherent in the CPI.
18
In
addition, the Fed suggested that the PCE measure of consumption spending is
broader than the CPI, and the PCE measure has the advantage of being revised
when better data are available, whereas the CPI is not revised.
Other differences between the CPI and PCE price index include differences in
the formulas used to calculate the index, the coverage of different items, and the
weights given to different items.
19
The CPI is an index with a given base year
while the PCE price index is a chain-weighted index, as discussed in ”In Touch
with Data and Research: The Computer Revolution and Chain-Weighted GDP,” 
p. 44. The PCE price index covers more types of goods and services, as the CPI is
based on the average spending habits of people who live in urban areas, whereas
the PCE price index covers all spending on consumer goods in the economy. The
weights on different spending categories differ as well; for example, homeowner-
ship costs are about 20% of the CPI but only about 11% of the PCE price index.
The Fed used the rate of change of the PCE price index as its main measure of inﬂa-
tion beginning in 2000, but became somewhat dissatisﬁed with it because short-term
shocks to food or energy prices frequently caused sharp ﬂuctuations in the inﬂation
rate. So, in 2004, the Fed switched its main inﬂation variable to the PCE price index
excluding food and energy prices. We call the inﬂation rate using this index the core
PCE inﬂation rate and we call the inﬂation rate that includes food and energy prices the
overall PCE inﬂation rate. In announcing the switch in 2004, the Fed argued that the core
PCE inﬂation rate was a better measure of “underlying inﬂation trends.”
20
In November 2007, however, the Fed decided that it should provide forecasts
to the public for both the overall PCE inﬂation rate and the core PCE inﬂation rate.
The rationale was laid out in a speech by Federal Reserve governor Frederic
Mishkin, who noted that although monetary policymakers should focus on core
inﬂation for determining monetary policy, there was good reason also to keep an
eye on overall inﬂation.
21
After all, that measure more closely matches the goods
and services actually bought by households, and if unwatched, it may deviate
from core inﬂation in ways that are detrimental to households.
Figure 2.2 shows how overall PCE inﬂation differs from core PCE inﬂation.
The ﬁgure shows the inﬂation rates from January 1960 to June 2009.

The data plotted in Figure 2.2 are the inﬂation rates between one month and the same month one
year earlier. The inﬂation rate is calculated by dividing the price index for a particular month by the
value twelve months earlier, then subtracting 1 and multiplying by 100 to put the result in percentage 
points. That is, the inﬂation rate is where P

substantially in many years. Large increases in the price of oil in the mid 1970s and
again in the late 1970s caused the overall PCE inﬂation rate to be above the core PCE
inﬂation rate during these episodes. However, as the relative price of oil declined in
the 1980s, the overall PCE inﬂation rate was less than the core PCE inﬂation rate
from 1982 to 1987. After that, the core PCE inﬂation rate has not varied as much as
the overall PCE inﬂation rate. Generally, the overall PCE inﬂation rate tends to
revert to the core PCE inﬂation rate after several years of being above it or below it.

2.5 Interest Rates
Interest rates are another important—and familiar—type of economic variable. An
interest rate is a rate of return promised by a borrower to a lender. If, for example, the
interest rate on a $100, one-year loan is 8%, the borrower has promised to repay the
lender $108 one year from now, or $8 interest plus repayment of the $100 borrowed.
As we discuss in more detail in Chapter 4, there are many different interest
rates in the economy. Interest rates vary according to who is doing the borrowing,
how long the funds are borrowed for, and other factors (see “In Touch with Data
and Research: Interest Rates,” p. 114). There are also many assets in the economy,
such as shares of corporate stock, that do not pay a speciﬁed interest rate but do
pay their holders a return; for shares of stock, the return comes in the form of
dividends and capital gains (increases in the stock’s market price). The existence of
so many different assets, each with its own rate of return, has the potential to com-
plicate greatly the study of macroeconomics. Fortunately, however, most interest
rates and other rates of return tend to move up and down together. For purposes of
macroeconomic analysis we usually speak of “the” interest rate, as if there were
only one. If we say that a certain policy causes “the” interest rate to rise, for exam-
ple, we mean that interest rates and rates of return in general are likely to rise.

Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 51
Real Versus Nominal Interest Rates. Interest rates and other rates of return share
a measurement problem with nominal GDP: An interest rate indicates how quickly
the nominal, or dollar, value of an interest-bearing asset increases over time, but it
does not reveal how quickly the value of the asset changes in real, or purchasing-
power, terms. Consider, for example, a savings account with an interest rate of 4%
per year that has $300 in it at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year the
savings account is worth $312, which is a relatively good deal for the depositor if
inﬂation is zero; with no inﬂation the price level is unchanged over the year, and
$312 buys 4% more goods and services in real terms than the initial $300 did one year
earlier. If inﬂation is 4%, however, what cost $300 one year earlier now costs $312,
and in real terms the savings account is worth no more today than it was a year ago.
To distinguish changes in the real value of assets from changes in nominal
value, economists frequently use the concept of the real interest rate. The real
interest rate (or real rate of return) on an asset is the rate at which the real value or
purchasing power of the asset increases over time. We refer to conventionally mea-
sured interest rates, such as those reported in the media, as nominal interest rates,
to distinguish them from real interest rates. The nominal interest rate (or nominal
rate of return) is the rate at which the nominal value of an asset increases over time.
The symbol for the nominal interest rate is i.
The real interest rate is related to the nominal interest rate and the inﬂation rate
as follows:
(2.12)
We derive and discuss Eq. (2.12) further at the end of the book in Appendix A, Sec-
tion A.7.
23
For now, consider again the savings account paying 4% interest. If the
inﬂation rate is zero, the real interest rate on that savings account is the 4% nomi-
nal interest rate minus the 0% inﬂation rate, which equals 4%. A 4% real interest
rate on the account means that the depositor will be able to buy 4% more goods and
services at the end of the year than at the beginning. But if inﬂation is 4%, the real
interest rate on the savings account is the 4% nominal interest rate minus the 4%
inﬂation rate, which equals 0%. In this case, the purchasing power of the account is
no greater at the end of the year than at the beginning.
Nominal and real interest rates for the United States for 1960–2008 are shown
in Fig. 2.3. The real interest rate was unusually low in the mid 1970s; indeed, it was
negative, which means that the real values of interest-bearing assets actually were
declining over time. Both nominal and real interest rates rose to record highs in the
early 1980s before returning to a more normal level in the 1990s. But the real inter-
est rate turned negative in the early 2000s and was close to zero in 2008.
The Expected Real Interest Rate. When you borrow, lend, or make a bank
deposit, the nominal interest rate is speciﬁed in advance. But what about the real
interest rate? For any nominal interest rate, Eq. (2.12) states that the real interest
rate depends on the rate of inﬂation over the period of the loan or deposit—say,
one year. However, the rate of inﬂation during the year generally can’t be
determined until the year is over. Thus, at the time that a loan or deposit is made,
the real interest rate that will be received is uncertain.
= i -   .
real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate
23
Equation (2.12) is an approximation rather than an exact relationship. This approximation holds
most closely when interest rates and inﬂation rates are not too high.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. The national income accounts are an accounting
framework used in measuring current economic
activity. The national income accounts measure activ-
ity in three ways: the product approach, the expendi-
ture approach, and the income approach. Although
each gives the same value for current economic activ-
ity, all three approaches are used because each gives a
different perspective on the economy.
2. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the broadest mea-
sure of aggregate economic activity occurring during
a specified period of time. The product approach
measures GDP by adding the market values of ﬁnal

on three-year Treasury
securities. The real inter-
est rate is measured as
the nominal interest rate
minus the average inﬂa-
tion rate (using the GDP
deﬂator) over the current
and subsequent two
years. The real interest
rate was unusually low
(actually negative) in the
mid 1970s. In the early
1980s, both the nominal
and real interest rates
were very high. Nominal
and real interest rates
returned to more normal
levels in the 1990s, then
fell sharply in the early
2000s.
Source: The implicit price
deﬂator for GDP is the same as
for Fig. 2.1. Inﬂation rates for
2009 and 2010 are assumed to
be 2%. The nominal interest
rate on three-year Treasury
securities is from the Board

RATE
Because borrowers, lenders, and depositors don’t know what the actual real
interest rate will be, they must make their decisions about how much to borrow,
lend, or deposit on the basis of the real interest rate they expect to prevail. They
know the nominal interest rate in advance, so the real interest rate they expect
depends on what they think inﬂation will be. The expected real interest rate is the
nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inﬂation, or
(2.13)
where r is the expected real interest rate and π
e
is the expected rate of inﬂation.
Comparing Eqs. (2.13) and (2.12), you can see that if people are correct in their
expectations—so that expected inﬂation and actual inﬂation turn out to be the same—
the expected real interest rate and the real interest rate actually received will be the same.
The expected real interest rate is the correct interest rate to use for studying
most types of economic decisions, such as people’s decisions about how much to
borrow or lend. However, a problem in measuring the expected real interest rate is
that economists generally don’t know exactly what the public’s expected rate of
inﬂation is. Economists use various means to measure expected inﬂation. One
approach is to survey the public and simply ask what rate of inﬂation people
expect. A second method is to assume that the public’s expectations of inﬂation are
the same as publicly announced government or private forecasts. A third possibil-
ity is to assume that people’s inﬂation expectations are an extrapolation of recent-
ly observed rates of inﬂation. Unfortunately, none of these methods is perfect, so
the measurement of the expected real interest rate always contains some error.

goods and services newly produced in an economy;
this approach sums the value added by all producers.
The expenditure approach measures GDP by adding
the four categories of spending: consumption, invest-
ment, government purchases, and net exports. The
income approach measures GDP by adding all the
incomes, including taxes and proﬁts, generated by
economic activity.
3. The income of the private sector (domestic house-
holds and businesses) is called private disposable
income. Private disposable income equals income
received from private-sector activities (GDP plus net
factor payments from abroad, or GNP) plus pay-
ments received from the government (transfers and
interest on government debt) minus taxes paid to the
government. The net income of the government
sector equals taxes collected minus transfer pay-
ments and interest paid on government debt. Private
disposable income and net government income sum
to GNP .
4. Saving is the portion of an economic unit’s current
income that it doesn’t spend to meet current needs.
Saving by the private sector, called private saving,
equals private disposable income minus consump-
tion. Government saving, which is the same as the
government budget surplus, equals the govern-
ment’s net income minus its purchases of goods and
services (assuming that government purchases are
devoted solely to government consumption rather
than partially to government investment). Equiva-
lently, government saving equals government
receipts minus government outlays. National saving
is the sum of private saving and government saving;
it equals GDP plus net factor payments from abroad
minus consumption and government purchases.
5. The uses-of-saving identity states that private saving
equals the sum of investment, the government
budget deficit, and the current account balance.
Equivalently, national saving equals the sum of
investment and the current account balance.
6. The national wealth of a country equals its physical
assets, such as capital, plus its net foreign assets.
National wealth increases in two ways: through
changes in the value of existing assets and through
national saving. National saving adds to national
wealth because national saving is used either for
investment, thus adding to physical capital, or for
lending to foreigners an amount that equals the cur-
rent account balance, which increases the country’s
net foreign assets.
7. Nominal GDP is the value of an economy’s final
output measured at current market prices. Real GDP
is a measure of the economy’s ﬁnal output valued in
terms of prices in a base year. Real GDP equals nom-
inal GDP divided by the GDP deﬂator/100.
8. A price index is a measure of the current price level
relative to a base year. The GDP deﬂator measures
the overall price level of goods and services includ-
ed in GDP . The consumer price index (CPI) measures
the price level of a basket of consumer goods. The
rate of inﬂation is the percentage rate of change of
the price level, as measured by percentage rate of
change of a price index such as the GDP deﬂator or
the CPI.
9. An interest rate is a rate of return promised by a bor-
rower to a lender. The nominal interest rate is the
rate at which the nominal value of an interest-bearing
asset increases over time. The real interest rate, or the
nominal interest rate minus the rate of inﬂation, is the
rate at which the value of an asset grows in real, or
purchasing-power, terms. Borrowing and lending
decisions are based on the expected real interest rate,
which is the nominal interest rate less the expected
rate of inﬂation.

KEY EQUATIONS
(2.1)
The fundamental identity of national income accounting states
that the same value of total economic activity is obtained
whether activity is measured by the production of ﬁnal
goods and services, the amount of income generated by
the economic activity, or the expenditure on ﬁnal goods
and services.
(2.3)
According to the income-expenditure identity, total income
or product or output, Y, equals the sum of the four types
of expenditure: consumption, C, investment, I, govern-
ment purchases, G, and net exports, NX.
(2.6)
Private saving equals private disposable income less con-
sumption, C. Private sector disposable income equals
gross domestic product, Y, plus net factor payments from
abroad, NFP, plus transfers, TR, and interest, INT, received
from the government, less taxes paid, T.
(2.7)
Government saving equals government receipts from
taxes, T, less outlays for transfers, TR, interest on the
national debt, INT, and government purchases, G.

Government saving is the same as the government budget
surplus and is the negative of the government budget

(2.8)
National saving, S, is the sum of private saving and gov-
ernment saving. Equivalently, national saving equals gross
domestic product, Y, plus net factor payments from
abroad, NFP, less consumption, C, and government pur-
chases, G.
(2.10)
National saving, S, has two uses: to ﬁnance investment, I,
and to lend to foreigners (or to acquire foreign assets) an
amount that equals the current account balance, CA. The cur-
rent account balance equals the increase in net foreign assets.
(2.11)
According to the uses-of-saving identity, private saving is used
to ﬁnance investment spending, I, to provide the govern-
ment with the funds it needs to cover its budget deﬁcit,  
-S

, and to lend to foreigners (or to acquire foreign assets)
an amount that equals the current account balance, CA.

NUMERICAL PROBLEMS
All numerical problems are available in 
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. After a boat rescues everyone else from Gilligan’s Island,
the Professor and Gilligan remain behind, afraid of get-
ting shipwrecked again with the same bunch of people.
The Professor grows coconuts and catches ﬁsh. Last year
he harvested 1000 coconuts and caught 500 ﬁsh. He
values one ﬁsh as worth two coconuts. The Professor
gave 200 coconuts to Gilligan in exchange for help in the
harvest, and he gave Gilligan 100 ﬁsh in exchange for
collecting worms for use in ﬁshing. The Professor stored
100 of his coconuts in his hut for consumption at some
future time. Gilligan consumed all his coconuts and ﬁsh.
In terms of fish, what is the GDP of Gilligan’s
Island? What are consumption and investment? What
are the incomes of the Professor and Gilligan?
2. National income and product data are generally revised.
What effects would the following revisions have on con-
sumption, investment, government purchases, net
exports, and GDP?
a. It is discovered that consumers bought $6 billion
more furniture than previously thought. This fur-
niture was manufactured in North Carolina.
b. It is discovered that consumers bought $6 billion
more furniture than previously thought. This fur-
niture was manufactured in Sweden.
c. It is discovered that businesses bought $6 billion
more furniture than previously thought. This fur-
niture was manufactured in North Carolina.
d. It is discovered that businesses bought $6 billion
more furniture than previously thought. This fur-
niture was manufactured in Sweden.
3. ABC Computer Company has a $20,000,000 factory in
Silicon Valley. During the current year ABC builds
$2,000,000 worth of computer components. ABC’s costs
are labor, $1,000,000; interest on debt, $100,000; and taxes,
$200,000.
ABC sells all its output to XYZ Supercomputer.
Using ABC’s components, XYZ builds four supercom-
puters at a cost of $800,000 each ($500,000 worth of com-
ponents, $200,000 in labor costs, and $100,000 in taxes per
computer). XYZ has a $30,000,000 factory.
XYZ sells three of the supercomputers for $1,000,000
each. At year’s end, it had not sold the fourth. The
unsold computer is carried on XYZ’s books as an
$800,000 increase in inventory.
a. Calculate the contributions to GDP of these trans-
actions, showing that all three approaches give the
same answer.
b. Repeat part (a), but now assume that, in addition to
its other costs, ABC paid $500,000 for imported
computer chips.
4. For each of the following transactions, determine the
contribution to the current year’s GDP. Explain the
effects on the product, income, and expenditure
accounts.
a. On January 1, you purchase 10 gallons of gasoline
at $2.80 per gallon. The gas station purchased the
gasoline the previous week at a wholesale price
(transportation included) of $2.60 per gallon.
b. Colonel Hogwash purchases a Civil War–era man-
sion for $1,000,000. The broker’s fee is 6%.
c. A homemaker enters the work force, taking a job
that will pay $40,000 over the year. The homemak-
er must pay $16,000 over the year for professional
child care services.
d. A Japanese company builds an auto plant in Ten-
nessee for $100,000,000, using only local labor and
materials. (Hint: The auto plant is a capital good pro-
duced by Americans and purchased by the Japanese.)
e. You are informed that you have won $3,000,000 in
the New Jersey State Lottery, to be paid to you, in
total, immediately.
f. The New Jersey state government pays you an

economy? What is the relationship between private
saving and national saving?
7. What is national wealth, and why is it important? How is
national wealth linked to national saving?

56 Part 1 Introduction
ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. A reputable study shows that a particular new work-
place safety regulation will reduce the growth of real
GDP. Is this an argument against implementing the
regulation? Explain.
2. Consider a closed economy with a single telephone
company , Calls-R-Us. The residents of the country make
2 million phone calls per year and pay $3 per phone
call. One day a new phone company, CheapCall, enters
Motors. It sells its old ﬂeet to a consortium of used-
car dealers for $40,000,000. The consortium resells
the used cars to the public for a total of $60,000,000.
5. You are given the following information about an
economy:
Gross private domestic investment = 40
Government purchases of goods and services = 30
Gross national product (GNP) = 200
Current account balance =- 20
Taxes = 60
Government transfer payments to the domestic private
sector = 25
Interest payments from the government to the domestic
private sector = 15 (Assume all interest payments by the
government go to domestic households.)
Factor income received from rest of world = 7
Factor payments made to rest of world = 9
Find the following, assuming that government invest-
ment is zero:
a. Consumption
b. Net exports
c. GDP
d. Net factor payments from abroad
e. Private saving
f. Government saving
g. National saving
6. Consider an economy that produces only three types
of fruit: apples, oranges, and bananas. In the base year
(a few years ago), the production and price data were
as follows:
a. Find nominal GDP in the current year and in the
base year. What is the percentage increase since the
base year?
b. Find real GDP in the current year and in the base
year. By what percentage does real GDP increase
from the base year to the current year?
c. Find the GDP deﬂator for the current year and the
base year. By what percentage does the price level
change from the base year to the current year?
d. Would you say that the percentage increase in
nominal GDP in this economy since the base year is
due more to increases in prices or increases in the
physical volume of output?
7. For the consumer price index values shown, calculate the
rate of inﬂation in each year from 1930 to 1933. What is
unusual about this period, relative to recent experience?
Fruit Quantity Price
Apples 3,000 bags $2 per bag
Bananas 6,000 bunches $3 per bunch
Oranges 8,000 bags $4 per bag
In the current year the production and price data are as
follows:
Fruit Quantity Price
Apples 4,000 bags $3 per bag
Bananas 14,000 bunches $2 per bunch
Oranges 32,000 bags $5 per bag
Year 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933

8. Hy Marks buys a one-year government bond on January
1, 2009, for $500. He receives principal plus interest total-
ing $545 on January 1, 2010. Suppose that the CPI is 200 on
January 1, 2009, and 214 on January 1, 2010. This increase
in prices is more than Hy had anticipated; his guess was
that the CPI would be at 210 by the beginning of 2010.
Find the nominal interest rate, the inﬂation rate, the real
interest rate, Hy’s expected inﬂation rate, and Hy’s
expected real interest rate.
9. The GDP deﬂator in Econoland is 200 on January 1, 2008.
The deﬂator rises to 242 by January 1, 2010, and to 266.2
by January 1, 2011.
a. What is the annual rate of inﬂation over the two-
year period between January 1, 2008, and January
1, 2010? In other words, what constant yearly rate
of inﬂation would lead to the price rise observed
over those two years?
b. What is the annual rate of inﬂation over the three-
year period from January 1, 2008, to January 1, 2011?
c. In general, if P

the market and charges only $2 per phone call. All of the
residents immediately stop using Calls-R-Us and switch
to CheapCall. They still make 2 million phone calls per
year. The executives of CheapCall are proud of their
market share. Moreover, they post billboards stating,
“Our country has increased its national saving by
$2 million per year by switching to CheapCall.” Com-
ment on the accuracy of the statement on the billboards.
3. Economists have tried to measure the GDPs of virtually
all the world’s nations. This problem asks you to think
about some practical issues that arise in that effort.
a. Before the fall of communism, the economies of the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were centrally
planned. One aspect of central planning is that most
prices are set by the government. A government-set
price may be too low, in that people want to buy
more of the good at the ﬁxed price than there are sup-
plies available; or the price may be too high, so that
large stocks of the good sit unsold on store shelves.
What problem does government control of
prices create for economists attempting to measure a
country’s GDP? Suggest a strategy for dealing with
this problem.
b. In very poor, agricultural countries, many people
grow their own food, make their own clothes, and
provide services for one another within a family or
village group. Ofﬁcial GDP estimates for these coun-
tries are often extremely low, perhaps just a few
hundred dollars per person. Some economists have
argued that the ofﬁcial GDP ﬁgures underestimate
these nations’ actual GDPs. Why might this be so?
Again, can you suggest a strategy for dealing with
this measurement problem?
4. Government saving is deﬁned as T - (G + TR + INT),
where G is government purchases. But suppose that
we split government purchases into two parts: gov-
ernment consumption expenditures (GCE) and
government investment (GI) and that we deﬁne a new
version of government saving, which is T - (GCE +
TR + INT). With this new definition of government
saving, which treats government investment similarly
to private investment, how would the uses-of-savings
identity be modiﬁed?
To investigate how much difference this redeﬁni-
tion would make, look at the NIPA section of a recent
issue of the Survey of Current Business or online at
www. bea.gov, and ﬁnd Table 5.1, “Gross Saving and
Investment.” The table refers to private saving as gross
private saving, to investment as gross private domestic
investment, to the current account balance as net for-
eign investment, to government investment as gross
government investment, and to the new version of
government saving as gross government saving. Verify
that both the old and new deﬁnitions of the uses-of-
savings identity are valid, except for statistical dis-
crepancies.
Chapter 2 The Measurement and Structure of the National Economy 57
WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. Graph the four main expenditure components of GDP , in
real terms, since the ﬁrst quarter of 1947. Also graph the
expenditure components as a share of total real GDP . Do
you see any signiﬁcant trends?
2. On the same ﬁgure, graph national saving and invest-
ment as fractions of real GDP , using quarterly U.S. data
since 1947. (Note that national saving is called gross
saving in the FRED database.) How does the behavior
of these variables in the past ten years compare to their
behavior in earlier periods? How is it possible for
investment to exceed national saving, as it does in some
periods?
3. Graph the annual (December to December) CPI inﬂation
rate and the annual (fourth quarter to fourth quarter)
GDP deflator inflation rate since 1960 on the same
ﬁgure. What are the conceptual differences between
these two measures of inﬂation? Judging from your
graph, would you say that the two measures give simi-
lar or different estimates of the rate of inﬂation in the
economy?
4. If the real interest rate were approximately constant, then
in periods in which inﬂation is high, the nominal interest
rate should be relatively high (because the nominal inter-
est rate equals the real interest rate plus the inﬂation
rate). Using annual data since 1948, graph the three-
month Treasury bill interest rate (“Discount rate on new
ninety-one-day Treasury bills”) and the CPI inﬂation rate
for the U.S. economy. (Take annual averages of monthly
interest rates and measure annual inﬂation rates as the
change in the CPI from December to December.) Is it
generally true that nominal interest rates rise with inﬂa-
tion? Does the relationship appear to be one-for-one (so
that each additional percentage point of inﬂation raises
the nominal interest rate by one percentage point), as
would be the case if the real interest rate were constant?
Calculate the real interest rate and graph its behavior
since 1948.

Productivity, Output, 
and Employment
In Chapter 2 we discussed the measurement of several economic variables used to
gauge the economy’s health. The measurement of economic performance is a pre-
lude to the main objective of macroeconomics: to understand how the economy works.
Understanding how the economy works requires a shift from economic
measurement to economic analysis.
In Part 2 of this book, which begins with this chapter, we have two main goals.
The ﬁrst is to analyze the factors that affect the longer-term performance of the
economy, including the rate of economic growth, productivity and living stan-
dards, the long-run levels of employment and unemployment, saving and capital
formation, and the rate of inﬂation, among others.
The second goal is to develop a theoretical model of the macroeconomy that
you can use to analyze the economic issues covered in this book and others that
you may encounter in the future. As outlined in Chapter 1, our model is based on
the assumption that individuals, firms, and the government interact in three
aggregate markets: the labor market (covered in this chapter), the goods market
(Chapter 4), and the asset market (Chapter 7). In developing and using this model
in Part 2, we generally assume that the economy is at full employment, with
quantities supplied and demanded being equal in the three major markets. As we
are focusing on the long-term behavior of the economy, this assumption is a rea-
sonable one. In Part 3, in which we explore business cycles, we allow for the pos-
sibility that quantities supplied and demanded may not be equal in the short run.
In this chapter, we begin the discussion of how the economy works with what
is perhaps the most fundamental determinant of economic well-being in a society:
the economy’s productive capacity. Everything else being equal, the greater the
quantity of goods and services an economy can produce, the more people will be
able to consume in the present and the more they will be able to save and invest for
the future.
In the ﬁrst section of the chapter we show that the amount of output an econ-
omy produces depends on two factors: (1) the quantities of inputs (such as labor,
capital, and raw materials) utilized in the production process; and (2) the
productivity of the inputs—that is, the effectiveness with which they are used. As
discussed in Chapter 1, an economy’s productivity is basic to determining living
standards. In this chapter we show how productivity affects people’s incomes by
helping to determine how many workers are employed and how much they receive
in wages.
CHAPTER 3
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 58
Chapter 3 Productivity, Output, and Employment 59
Of the various inputs to production, the most important (as measured
by share of total cost) is labor. For this reason, we spend most of the chapter
analyzing the labor market, using the tools of supply and demand. We first con-
sider the factors that affect the quantity of labor demanded by employers and
supplied by workers and then look at the forces that bring the labor market into
equilibrium. Equilibrium in the labor market determines wages and employ-
ment; in turn, the level of employment, together with the quantities of other
inputs (such as capital) and the level of productivity, determines how much
output an economy produces.
Our basic model of the labor market rests on the assumption that the quan-
tities of labor supplied and demanded are equal so that all labor resources are
fully utilized. In reality, however, there are always some unemployed workers. In
the latter part of the chapter, we introduce unemployment and look at the rela-
tionship between the unemployment rate and the amount of output produced in
the economy.
3.1 How Much Does the Economy Produce? The Production Function
Every day the business news reports many economic variables that inﬂuence the
economy’s performance—the rate of consumer spending, the value of the dollar,
the gyrations of the stock market, the growth rate of the money supply, and so on.
All of these variables are important. However, no determinant of economic per-
formance and living standards is more basic than the economy’s physical capacity
to produce goods and services. If an economy’s factories, farms, and other busi-
nesses all shut down for some reason, other economic factors wouldn’t mean much.
What determines the quantity of goods and services that an economy can pro-
duce? A key factor is the quantity of inputs—such as capital goods, labor, raw
materials, land, and energy—that producers in the economy use. Economists refer
to inputs to the production process as factors of production. All else being equal,
the greater the quantities of factors of production used, the more goods and ser-
vices are produced.
Of the various factors of production, the two most important are capital
(factories and machines, for example) and labor (workers). Hence we focus on
these two factors in discussing an economy’s capacity to produce goods and
services. In modern economies, however, output often responds strongly to
changes in the supply of other factors, such as energy or raw materials. Later in
this chapter, the Application “Output, Employment, and the Real Wage During
Oil Price Shocks,” p. 85, discusses the effects of a disruption in oil supplies on
the economy.
The quantities of capital and labor (and other inputs) used in production don’t
completely determine the amount of output produced. Equally important is how
effectively these factors are used. For the same stocks of capital and labor, an econ-
omy with superior technologies and management practices, for example, will pro-
duce a greater amount of output than an economy without those strengths.
The effectiveness with which capital and labor are used may be summarized by
a relationship called the production function. The production function is a mathe-
matical expression relating the amount of output produced to quantities of capital
and labor utilized. A convenient way to write the production function is
(3.1) Y = AF(K, N),

60 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
where
The production function in Eq. (3.1) applies both to an economy as a whole (where
Y, K, and N refer to the economy’s output, capital stock, and number of workers,
respectively) and to an individual ﬁrm, in which case Y, K, and N refer to the ﬁrm’s
output, capital, and number of workers, respectively.
According to Eq. (3.1), the amount of output Y that an economy (or ﬁrm) can
produce during any period of time depends on the size of the capital stock K and the
number of workers N. The symbol A in Eq. (3.1), which multiplies the function F(K, N),
is a measure of the overall effectiveness with which capital and labor are used. We
refer to A as total factor productivity, or simply productivity. Note that, for any
values of capital and labor, an increase in productivity of, say, 10% implies a 10%
increase in the amount of output that can be produced. Thus increases in produc-
tivity, A, correspond to improvements in production technology or to any other
change in the economy that allows capital and labor to be utilized more effectively.
 F = a function relating output Y to capital K and labor N.
 N = the number of workers employed in the period;
 K = the capital stock, or quantity of capital used in the period;
 A = a number measuring overall productivity;
 Y = real output produced in a given period of time;
APPLICATION
The Production Function of the U.S. Economy 
and U.S. Productivity Growth
Empirical studies show that the relationship between output and inputs in the
U.S. economy is described reasonably well by the following production function:

(3.2)
The production function in Eq. (3.2) is a speciﬁc example of the general pro-
duction function in Eq. (3.1), in which we set the general function F(K, N) equal to
K
0.3
N
0.7
. (Note that this production function contains exponents; if you need to
review the properties of exponents, see Appendix A, Section A.6.)
Equation (3.2) shows how output, Y, relates to the use of factors of production,
capital, K, and labor, N, and to productivity, A, in the United States. Table 3.1 pre-
sents data on these variables for the U.S. economy for 29 years beginning in 1979.
Columns (1), (2), and (3) show output (real GDP), capital stock, and labor for each
year. Real GDP and the capital stock are measured in billions of 2000 dollars, and
labor is measured in millions of employed workers. Column (4) shows the U.S.
economy’s productivity for each year.
Output, capital, and labor in Table 3.1 are measured directly , but there is no way to
measure productivity directly. Instead, the productivity index, A, shown in column

This type of production function is called a Cobb-Douglas production function. Cobb-Douglas pro-
duction functions take the form Y = AK

N

, where 0 a 1. Under certain conditions, the parame-
ter a in the Cobb-Douglas production function corresponds to the share of income received by owners
of capital, whereas labor receives a share of income equal to 1- a. Thus observing the actual shares of
income received by capital and labor provides a way of estimating the parameter a.

Speciﬁcally, for each year A is determined by the formula A = Y/(K

just another way of writing Eq. (3.2). In 2007, for example, Y = 11,523.9, K = 11,848.7,

or A= 21.103. Calculating productivity in this way ensures that the production func-
tion relationship, Eq. (3.2), is satisﬁed exactly for each year.
The levels of the productivity index, A, reported in Table 3.1 depend on the units
in which output, capital, and labor are measured—for example, the values of A would
change if workers were measured in thousands rather than millions—and thus are

To show the relationship among output and both factors of production simultaneously would
require a three-dimensional graph.
The Shape of the Production Function
The production function in Eq. (3.1) can be shown graphically. The easiest way to
graph it is to hold one of the two factors of production, either capital or labor, con-
stant and then graph the relationship between output and the other factor.
2
Sup-
pose that we use the U.S. production function for the year 2007 and hold labor N
at its actual 2007 value of 146.05 million workers (see Table 3.1). We also use the
actual 2007 value of 21.103 for A. The production function (Eq. 3.2) becomes
This relationship is graphed in Fig. 3.1, with capital stock K on the horizontal axis
and output Y on the vertical axis. With labor and productivity held at their 2007
values, the graph shows the amount of output that could have been produced in that
year for any value of the capital stock. Point A on the graph shows the situation that
actually occurred in 2007: The value of the capital stock ($11,849 billion) appears on the
horizontal axis, and the value of real GDP ($11,524 billion) appears on the vertical axis.
The U.S. production function graphed in Fig. 3.1 shares two properties with
most production functions:
1. The production function slopes upward from left to right. The slope of the production
function reveals that, as the capital stock increases, more output can be produced.
2. The slope of the production function becomes ﬂatter from left to right. This property
implies that although more capital always leads to more output, it does so at a
decreasing rate.
Before discussing the economics behind the second property of the produc-
tion function, we can illustrate it numerically, using Fig. 3.1. Suppose that we are

difﬁcult to interpret. In contrast, the year-to-year growth rates of the productivity
measure shown in column (5) are units-free and are therefore easier to work with. A
close look at the productivity growth rates shown in Table 3.1 emphasizes two points.
First, productivity growth can vary sharply from year to year. Most strikingly,
productivity in the United States fell 2.2% in 1982, a deep recession year, then rose
2.8% in 1983 and 3.1% in 1984, a period of economic recovery. Productivity also fell
slightly during the 2001 recession. Productivity normally falls in recessions and
rises in recoveries, but explanations for its behavior over the business cycle are con-
troversial. We return to this issue in Part 3 of this book.
Second, from 1980 to 1995, productivity in the United States had been growing
relatively slowly, averaging about 0.9% per year. This result is better than the per-
formance in the 1970s, when productivity growth was only 0.4% per year, but
notably less than in the 1950s and 1960s, when productivity growth averaged about
2.1% per year. But since 1995, productivity growth has increased, averaging 1.3%
per year. This recent increase in productivity growth is good news if it is sustained,
because the rate of productivity growth is closely related to the rate of improve-
ment of living standards. In Chapter 6 we discuss the relationship between pro-
ductivity and living standards in greater detail.
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 62
Chapter 3 Productivity, Output, and Employment 63
initially at point B, where the capital stock is $2000 billion. Adding $1000 billion
in capital moves us to point C, where the capital stock is $3000 billion. How
much extra output has this expansion in capital provided? The difference in
output between points B and C is $874 billion ($7632 billion output at C minus
$6758 billion output at B). This extra $874 billion in output is the benefit from
raising the capital stock from $2000 billion to $3000 billion, with productivity
and employment held constant.
Now suppose that, starting at C, we add another $1000 billion of capital. This
new addition of capital takes us to D, where the capital stock is $4000 billion. The
difference in output between C and D is only $688 billion ($8320 billion output at
D minus $7632 billion output at C), which is less than the $874 billion increase in
output between B and C. Thus, although the second $1000 billion of extra capital
raises total output, it does so by less than did the ﬁrst $1000 billion of extra capital.
This result illustrates that the production function rises less steeply between points
C and D than between points B and C.
The Marginal Product of Capital. The two properties of the production function
are closely related to a concept known as the marginal product of capital. To
understand this concept, we can start from some given capital stock, K, and

For deﬁnitions and a discussion of slopes of lines and curves, see Appendix A, Section A.2.

We often refer to the slope of the line tangent to the production function at a given point as simply
the slope of the production function at that point, for short.
increase the capital stock by some amount, ΔK (other factors held constant). This
increase in capital would cause output, Y, to increase by some amount, ΔY. The
marginal product of capital, or MPK, is the increase in output produced that
results from a one-unit increase in the capital stock. Because ΔK additional units
of capital permit the production of ΔY additional units of output, the amount of
additional output produced per additional unit of capital is ΔY/ΔK. Thus the
marginal product of capital is ΔY/ΔK.
The marginal product of capital, ΔY/ΔK, is the change in the variable on the ver-
tical axis of the production function graph, ΔY, divided by the change in the vari-
able on the horizontal axis, ΔK, which you might recognize as a slope.
3
For small
increases in the capital stock, the MPK can be measured by the slope of a line
drawn tangent to the production function. Figure 3.2 illustrates this way of mea-
suring the MPK. When the capital stock is 2000, for example, the MPK equals the
slope of the line tangent to the production function at point B.
4
We can use the con-
cept of the marginal product of capital to restate the two properties of production
functions listed earlier.
1. The marginal product of capital is positive. Whenever the capital stock is increased,
more output can be produced. Because the marginal product of capital is posi-
tive, the production function slopes upward from left to right.
2. The marginal product of capital declines as the capital stock is increased. Because the
marginal product of capital is the slope of the production function, the slope of
the production function decreases as the capital stock is increased. As Fig. 3.2
shows, the slope of the production function at point D, where the capital stock
is 4000, is smaller than the slope at point B, where the capital stock is 2000.
Thus the production function becomes ﬂatter from left to right.
The tendency for the marginal product of capital to decline as the amount of
capital in use increases is called the diminishing marginal productivity of capital.
The economic reason for diminishing marginal productivity of capital is as follows:
When the capital stock is low, there are many workers for each machine, and the
beneﬁts of increasing capital further are great; but when the capital stock is high,
workers already have plenty of capital to work with, and little beneﬁt is to be
gained from expanding capital further. For example, in a business ﬁrm’s call center
in which there are many more staff members than workstations (phones and com-
puter terminals), each workstation is constantly being utilized, and the staff must
waste time waiting for a free workstation. In this situation, the beneﬁt in terms of
increased output of adding extra workstations is high. However, if there are already
as many workstations as staff members, so that workstations are often idle and
there is no waiting for a workstation to become available, little additional output
can be obtained by adding yet another workstation.
The Marginal Product of Labor. In Figs. 3.1 and 3.2 we graphed the relationship
between output and capital implied by the 2007 U.S. production function, holding
constant the amount of labor. Similarly, we can look at the relationship between
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 64
output and labor, holding constant the quantity of capital. Suppose that we ﬁx
capital, K, at its actual 2007 value of $11,848.7 billion and hold productivity, A, at its
actual 2007 value of 21.103 (see Table 3.1). The production function (Eq. 3.2) becomes
This relationship is shown graphically in Fig. 3.3. Point A, where N = 146.0 mil-
lion workers and Y = $11,524 billion, corresponds to the actual 2007 values.
The production function relating output and labor looks generally the same as
the production function relating output and capital.
5
As in the case of capital,
increases in the number of workers raise output but do so at a diminishing rate.
Thus the principle of diminishing marginal productivity also applies to labor, and
for similar reasons: the greater the number of workers already using a ﬁxed amount
of capital and other inputs, the smaller the beneﬁt (in terms of increased output) of
adding even more workers.
The marginal product of labor, or MPN, is the additional output produced by
each additional unit of labor, ΔY/ΔN. As with the marginal product of capital, for
small increases in employment, the MPN can be measured by the slope of the line
tangent to a production function that relates output and labor. In Fig. 3.3, when

.
5
Because N is raised to the power of 0.7 but K is raised to the power of 0.3, the production function
relating output and labor is not as sharply bowed as the production function relating output and cap-
ital. The closer the power is to 1, the closer the production function will be to a straight line.
Figure 3.2

of capital
The marginal product of
capital (MPK) at any
point can be measured as
the slope of the line tan-
gent to the production
function at that point.
Because the slope of the
line tangent to the pro-
duction function at point
B is greater than the
slope of the line tangent
to the production func-
tion at point D, we know
that the MPK is greater at
B than at D. At higher
levels of capital stock, the
MPK is lower, reﬂecting
diminishing marginal
productivity of capital.

employment equals 30 million workers, the MPN equals the slope of the line
tangent to the production function at point B; when employment is 90 million
workers, the MPN is the slope of the line that touches the production function at
point C. Because of the diminishing marginal productivity of labor, the slope of the
production function relating output to labor is greater at B than at C, and the
production function ﬂattens from left to right.
Supply Shocks
The production function of an economy doesn’t usually remain ﬁxed over time.
Economists use the term supply shock—or, sometimes, productivity shock—to
refer to a change in an economy’s production function.
6
A positive, or beneﬁcial,
supply shock raises the amount of output that can be produced for given quantities
of capital and labor. A negative, or adverse, supply shock lowers the amount of
output that can be produced for each capital-labor combination.
Real-world examples of supply shocks include changes in the weather, such as
a drought or an unusually cold winter; inventions or innovations in management
6
The term shock is a slight misnomer. Not all changes in the production function are sharp or 
unpredictable, although many are.

techniques that improve efﬁciency, such as computerized inventory control or sta-
tistical analysis in quality control; and changes in government regulations, such as
antipollution laws, that affect the technologies or production methods used. Also
included in the category of supply shocks are changes in the supplies of factors of
production other than capital and labor that affect the amount that can be produced.
Figure 3.4 shows the effects of an adverse supply shock on the production
function relating output and labor. The negative supply shock shifts the production
function downward so that less output can be produced for speciﬁc quantities of
labor and capital. In addition, the supply shock shown reduces the slope of the pro-
duction function so that the output gains from adding a worker (the marginal
product of labor) are lower at every level of employment.
7
Conversely, a beneﬁcial
supply shock makes possible the production of more output with given quantities
of capital and labor and thus shifts the production function upward.
8
3.2 The Demand for Labor
We have shown that the amount of output produced by a country, or by a ﬁrm,
depends both on productivity and the quantities of inputs used in the production
process. In Section 3.1 our focus was on productivity—its measurement and factors
such as supply shocks that cause it to change. In this section, we examine what
determines the quantities of inputs that producers use.
7
Logically, an adverse supply shock need not always reduce the marginal products of labor and capi-
tal; for example, the production function could make a parallel downward shift. However, thinking of
an adverse supply shock reducing marginal products as being the normal case seems reasonable. A
shift of the production function like that shown in Fig. 3.4 would occur if there were a decline in total
factor productivity, A, for example.
8
The effects of supply shocks on the production function relating output and capital would be similar.

68 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Recall that the two most important inputs are capital and labor. The capital stock
in an economy changes over time as a result of investment by ﬁrms and the scrap-
ping of worn-out or obsolete capital. However, because the capital stock is long-
lived and has been built up over many years, new investment and the scrapping of
old capital only slowly have a signiﬁcant effect on the overall quantity of capital
available. Thus, for analyses spanning only a few quarters or years, economists often
treat the economy’s capital stock as ﬁxed. For now we follow this practice and
assume a ﬁxed capital stock. In taking up long-term economic growth in Chapter 6,
we drop this assumption and examine how the capital stock evolves over time.
In contrast to the amount of capital, the amount of labor employed in the econ-
omy can change fairly quickly. For example, ﬁrms may lay off workers or ask them
to work overtime without much notice. Workers may quit or decide to enter the
work force quickly. Thus year-to-year changes in production often can be traced to
changes in employment. To explain why employment changes, for the remainder
of this chapter we focus on how the labor market works, using a supply and
demand approach. In this section we look at labor demand, and in Section 3.3 we
discuss factors affecting labor supply.
As a step toward understanding the overall demand for labor in the economy,
we consider how an individual ﬁrm decides how many workers to employ. To keep
things simple for the time being, we make the following assumptions:
1. Workers are all alike. We ignore differences in workers’ aptitudes, skills, ambi-
tions, and so on.
2. Firms view the wages of the workers they hire as being determined in a competitive
labor market and not set by the ﬁrms themselves. For example, a competitive ﬁrm
in Cleveland that wants to hire machinists knows that it must pay the going
local wage for machinists if it wants to attract qualiﬁed workers. The ﬁrm then
decides how many machinists to employ.
3. In making the decision about how many workers to employ, a ﬁrm’s goal is to earn the
highest possible level of proﬁt (the value of its output minus its costs of produc-
tion, including taxes). The ﬁrm will demand the amount of labor that maxi-
mizes its proﬁt.
To ﬁgure out the proﬁt-maximizing amount of labor, the ﬁrm must compare the
costs and beneﬁts of hiring each additional worker. The cost of an extra worker is
the worker’s wage, and the beneﬁt of an extra worker is the value of the addition-
al goods or services the worker produces. As long as the beneﬁts of additional labor
exceed the costs, hiring more labor will increase the ﬁrm’s proﬁts. The ﬁrm will
continue to hire additional labor until the beneﬁt of an extra worker (the value of
extra goods or services produced) equals the cost (the wage).
The Marginal Product of Labor and Labor Demand: An Example
Let’s make the discussion of labor demand more concrete by looking at The Clip
Joint, a small business that grooms dogs. The Clip Joint uses both capital, such as
clippers, tubs, and brushes, and labor to produce its output of groomed dogs.
The production function that applies to The Clip Joint appears in Table 3.2. For
given levels of productivity and the capital stock, it shows how The Clip Joint’s daily
output of groomed dogs, column (2), depends on the number of workers employed,
column (1). The more workers The Clip Joint has, the greater its daily output is.

The MPN of each worker at The Clip Joint is shown in column (3). Employing
the ﬁrst worker raises The Clip Joint’s output from 0 to 11, so the MPN of the ﬁrst
worker is 11. Employing the second worker raises The Clip Joint’s output from 11
to 20, an increase of 9, so the MPN of the second worker is 9; and so on. Column (3)
also shows that, as the number of workers at The Clip Joint increases, the MPN falls
so that labor at The Clip Joint has diminishing marginal productivity. The more
workers there are on the job, the more they must share the ﬁxed amount of capital
(tubs, clippers, brushes), and the less beneﬁt there is to adding yet another worker.
The marginal product of labor measures the beneﬁt of employing an addition-
al worker in terms of the extra output produced. A related concept, the marginal
revenue product of labor, or MRPN, measures the beneﬁt of employing an addi-
tional worker in terms of the extra revenue produced. To calculate the MRPN, we
need to know the price of the ﬁrm’s output. If The Clip Joint receives $30 for each
dog it grooms, the MRPN of the ﬁrst worker is $330 per day (11 additional dogs
groomed per day at $30 per grooming). More generally, the marginal revenue
product of an additional worker equals the price of the ﬁrm’s output, P, times the
extra output gained by adding the worker, MPN:
(3.3)
At The Clip Joint the price of output, P, is $30 per grooming, so the MRPN of each
worker, column (4), equals the MPN of the worker, column (3), multiplied by $30.
Now suppose that the wage, W, that The Clip Joint must pay to attract qualiﬁed
workers is $240 per day. (We refer to the wage, W, when measured in the conven-
tional way in terms of today’s dollars, as the nominal wage.) How many workers
should The Clip Joint employ to maximize its proﬁts? To answer this question, The
Clip Joint compares the beneﬁts and costs of employing each additional worker.
The beneﬁt of employing an additional worker, in dollars per day, is the worker’s
marginal revenue product, MRPN. The cost of an additional worker, in dollars per
day, is the nominal daily wage, W.
MRPN = P * MPN.
Chapter 3 Productivity, Output, and Employment 69
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 69
70 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Table 3.2 shows that the MRPN of the ﬁrst worker is $330 per day, which
exceeds the daily wage of $240, so employing the ﬁrst worker is proﬁtable for The
Clip Joint. Adding a second worker increases The Clip Joint’s proﬁt as well because
the MRPN of the second worker ($270 per day) also exceeds the daily wage. How-
ever, employing a third worker reduces The Clip Joint’s proﬁt because the third
worker’s MRPN of $210 per day is less than the $240 daily wage. Therefore, The
Clip Joint’s proﬁt-maximizing level of employment at $240/ day—equivalently, the
quantity of labor demanded by The Clip Joint—is two workers.
In ﬁnding the quantity of labor demanded by The Clip Joint, we measured the
beneﬁts and costs of an extra worker in nominal, or dollar, terms. If we measure the
beneﬁts and costs of an extra worker in real terms, the results would be the same.
In real terms the beneﬁt to The Clip Joint of an extra worker is the number of extra
groomings that the extra worker provides, which is the marginal product of labor,
MPN. The real cost of adding another worker is the real wage, which is the wage
measured in terms of units of output. Algebraically, the real wage, w, equals the
nominal wage, W, divided by the price of output, P.
In this example the nominal wage, W, is $240 per day and the price of
output, P, is $30 per grooming, so the real wage, w, equals ($240 per day)/($30 per
grooming), or 8 groomings per day. To ﬁnd the proﬁt-maximizing level of employ-
ment, The Clip Joint compares this real cost of an additional worker with the real
beneﬁt of an additional worker, the MPN. The MPN of the ﬁrst worker is 11 groom-
ings per day, which exceeds the real wage of 8 groomings per day, so employing
this worker is proﬁtable. The second worker also should be hired, as the second
worker’s MPN of 9 groomings per day also exceeds the real wage of 8 groomings
per day. However, a third worker should not be hired, as the third worker’s MPN
of 7 groomings per day is less than the real wage. The quantity of labor demanded
by The Clip Joint is therefore two workers, which is the same result we got when
we compared costs and beneﬁts in nominal terms.
This example shows that, when the beneﬁt of an additional worker exceeds the
cost of an additional worker, the ﬁrm should increase employment so as to maxi-
mize proﬁts. Similarly, if at the ﬁrm’s current employment level the beneﬁt of the
last worker employed is less than the cost of the worker, the ﬁrm should reduce
employment. For example, if The Clip Joint currently employed three workers, the
MRPN of the third worker is $210, which is less than the nominal wage of $240, so
the ﬁrm should ﬁre one worker. Summary table 2 compares beneﬁts and costs of
additional labor in both real and nominal terms. In the choice of the proﬁt-maxi-
mizing level of employment, a comparison of beneﬁts and costs in either real or
nominal terms is equally valid.
A Change in the Wage
The Clip Joint’s decision to employ two workers was based on a nominal wage
of $240 per day. Now suppose that for some reason the nominal wage needed to
attract qualified workers drops to $180 per day. How will the reduction in the
nominal wage affect the number of workers that The Clip Joint wants to
employ?
To find the answer, we can compare costs and benefits in either nominal or
real terms. Let’s make the comparison in real terms. If the nominal wage drops
to $180 per day while the price of groomings remains at $30, the real wage falls
to ($180 per day)/($30 per grooming), or 6 groomings per day. Column (3) of
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 70
SUMMARY 2
Comparing the Benefits and Costs of Changing 
the Amount of Labor
Table 3.2 shows that the MPN of the third worker is 7 groomings per day, which
is now greater than the real wage. Thus, at the lower wage, expanding the
quantity of labor demanded from two to three workers is profitable for The Clip
Joint. However, the firm will not hire a fourth worker because the MPN of the
fourth worker (5 groomings per day) is less than the new real wage (6 groom-
ings per day).
This example illustrates a general point about the effect of the real wage on
labor demand: All else being equal, a decrease in the real wage raises the amount of
labor demanded. Similarly, an increase in the real wage decreases the amount of labor
demanded.
The Marginal Product of Labor and the Labor Demand Curve
Using The Clip Joint as an example, we showed the negative relationship
between the real wage and the quantity of labor that a ﬁrm demands. Figure 3.5
shows in more general terms how the link between the real wage and the quan-
tity of labor demanded is determined. The amount of labor, N, is on the horizon-
tal axis. The MPN and the real wage, both of which are measured in goods per
unit of labor, are on the vertical axis. The downward-sloping curve is the MPN
curve; it relates the marginal product of labor, MPN, to the amount of labor
employed by the ﬁrm, N. The MPN curve slopes downward because of the dimin-
ishing marginal productivity of labor. The horizontal line represents the real
wage ﬁrms face in the labor market, which the ﬁrms take as given. Here, the real 
wage is w*.
For any real wage, w*, the amount of labor that yields the highest profit
(and therefore the amount of labor demanded) is determined at point A, the
intersection of the real-wage line and the MPN curve. At A the quantity of labor
demanded is N*. Why is N* a firm’s profit-maximizing level of labor input? At
employment levels less than N*, the marginal product of labor exceeds the
real wage (the MPN curve lies above the real-wage line); thus, if the firm’s
employment is initially less than N*, it can increase its profit by expanding the
amount of labor it uses. Similarly, if the firm’s employment is initially greater

by locating the point on

that point is the amount
of labor demanded. For

point A and the quantity
of labor demanded is N*.

than N*, the marginal product of labor is less than the real wage (MPN < w*) and
the firm can raise profits by reducing employment. Only when employment
equals N* will the firm be satisfied with the number of workers it has. More gen-
erally, for any real wage, the profit-maximizing amount of labor input—labor
demanded—corresponds to the point at which the MPN curve and the real-
wage line intersect.
The graph of the relationship between the amount of labor demanded by a
firm and the real wage that the firm faces is called the labor demand curve.
Because the MPN curve also shows the amount of labor demanded at any real
wage, the labor demand curve is the same as the MPN curve, except that the vertical
axis measures the real wage for the labor demand curve and measures the mar-
ginal product of labor for the MPN curve.
9
Like the MPN curve, the labor
demand curve slopes downward, indicating that the quantity of labor demand-
ed falls as the real wage rises.
This labor demand curve is more general than that in the example of The
Clip Joint in a couple of ways that are worth mentioning. First, we referred to the
demand for labor and not specifically to the demand for workers, as in The Clip
Joint example. In general, labor, N, can be measured in various ways—for exam-
ple, as total hours worked, total weeks worked, or the number of employees—
depending on the application. Second, although we assumed in the example that
The Clip Joint had to hire a whole number of workers, the labor demand curve
shown in Fig. 3.5 allows labor, N, to have any positive value, whole or fractional.
Allowing N to take any value is sensible because people may work fractions of
an hour.
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 72
Factors That Shift the Labor Demand Curve
Because the labor demand curve shows the relation between the real wage and the
amount of labor that ﬁrms want to employ, changes in the real wage are repre-
sented as movements along the labor demand curve. Changes in the real wage do
not cause the labor demand curve to shift. The labor demand curve shifts in
response to factors that change the amount of labor that ﬁrms want to employ at
any given level of the real wage. For example, we showed earlier in this chapter that
beneﬁcial, or positive, supply shocks are likely to increase the MPN at all levels of
labor input and that adverse, or negative, supply shocks are likely to reduce the
MPN at all levels of labor input. Thus a beneﬁcial supply shock shifts the MPN
curve upward and to the right and raises the quantity of labor demanded at any
given real wage; an adverse supply shock does the reverse.
The effect of a supply shock on The Clip Joint’s demand for labor can be illustrat-
ed by imagining that the proprietor of The Clip Joint discovers that playing New Age
music soothes the dogs. It makes them more cooperative and doubles the number of
groomings per day that the same number of workers can produce. This technological
improvement gives The Clip Joint a new production function, as described in Table 3.3.
Note that doubling total output doubles the MPN at each employment level.
The Clip Joint demanded two workers when faced with the original produc-
tion function (Table 3.2) and a real wage of 8 groomings per day. Table 3.3 shows
that the productivity improvement increases The Clip Joint’s labor demand at the
given real wage to four workers, because the MPN of the fourth worker (10
groomings per day) now exceeds the real wage. The Clip Joint will not hire a ﬁfth
worker, however, because this worker’s MPN (6 groomings per day) is less than
the real wage.
The effect of a beneﬁcial supply shock on the labor demand curve is shown in
Fig. 3.6. The shock causes the MPN to increase at any level of labor input, so the
MPN curve shifts upward and to the right. Because the MPN and labor demand

An increase in the capital stock may reduce the demand for labor if the new capital substitutes for
the use of labor. For example, the installation of automatic tollbooths has reduced the marginal prod-

, the ﬁrm hires

Thus worker productivity and the amount of labor demanded are closely linked.
Another factor that may affect labor demand is the size of the capital stock.
Generally, an increase in the capital stock, K—by giving each worker more
machines or equipment to work with—raises workers’ productivity and increases
the MPN at any level of labor. Hence an increase in the capital stock will cause the
labor demand curve to shift upward and to the right, raising the amount of labor
that a ﬁrm demands at any particular real wage.

Aggregate Labor Demand
So far we have focused on the demand for labor by an individual ﬁrm, such as The
Clip Joint. For macroeconomic analysis, however, we usually work with the con-
cept of the aggregate demand for labor, or the sum of the labor demands of all the
ﬁrms in an economy.
Because the aggregate demand for labor is the sum of ﬁrms’ labor demands,
the factors that determine the aggregate demand for labor are the same as those for
an individual ﬁrm. Thus the aggregate labor demand curve looks the same as the
labor demand curve for an individual ﬁrm (Fig. 3.5). Like the ﬁrm’s labor demand
curve, the aggregate labor demand curve slopes downward, showing that an
increase in the economywide real wage reduces the total amount of labor that
ﬁrms want to use. Similarly, a beneﬁcial supply shock or an increase in the aggre-
gate capital stock shifts the aggregate labor demand curve upward and to the
right; an adverse supply shock or a drop in the aggregate capital stock shifts it
downward and to the left. The factors affecting aggregate labor demand are listed
for convenience in Summary table 3.
3.3 The Supply of Labor
The demand for labor is determined by ﬁrms, but the supply of labor is determined
by individuals or members of a family making a joint decision. Each person of
working age must decide how much (if at all) to work in the wage-paying sector of
the economy versus non-wage-paying alternatives, such as taking care of the home
and children, going to school, or being retired. The aggregate supply of labor is the
sum of the labor supplied by everyone in the economy.
Recall that, in determining how much labor to demand, ﬁrms compare the
costs and beneﬁts of hiring additional workers. Similarly, in deciding how much
to work, an individual should weigh the beneﬁts against the costs of working.
Beyond any psychological satisfaction gained from having a job, the principal
beneﬁt of working is the income earned, which can be used to buy necessities and
luxuries. The principal cost of working is that it involves time and effort that are
no longer available for other activities. Economists use the term leisure
11
for all
off-the-job activities, including eating, sleeping, working around the house, spend-
ing time with family and friends, and so on. To make themselves as well off as pos-
sible, individuals should choose to supply labor up to the point at which the
income obtained from working an extra hour just makes up for the extra hour of
leisure they have to forgo.
The Income–Leisure Trade-Off
To illustrate how the trade-off between income and leisure affects the labor
supply decision, let’s look at an example. Consider a tennis instructor named Ace
who offers tennis lessons. After paying taxes and job-related expenses, Ace can
earn $60 per hour, which we will call his (after-tax) nominal wage rate. Ace enjoys
11
The term leisure does not imply that all off-the-job activities (housework or schoolwork, for exam-
ple) are “leisurely”!

12
Not everyone can choose his or her labor supply as ﬂexibly as Ace; for example, some jobs are avail-
able for forty hours a week or not at all. Nevertheless, by choosing to work overtime, part-time, or at
a second job, or by varying the number of family members who are working, households do have a
signiﬁcant amount of latitude over how much labor to supply.
a reputation as an outstanding tennis instructor and could work as many hours
per year as he chooses. He is reluctant to work too much, however, because every
day he spends teaching tennis means one less day available to devote to his real
passion, skydiving. The decision Ace faces is how many hours to work this
year—or, in other words, how much labor to supply.
Ace approaches this question by asking himself: Economically speaking, what
really makes me happy? After a little reﬂection, Ace concludes that his level of hap-
piness, or utility, depends on the amount of goods and services he consumes and on
the amount of leisure time he has available to jump out of airplanes. His question
can therefore be recast as follows: How much should I work this year so as to
obtain the highest possible level of utility?
To ﬁnd the level of labor supply that maximizes his utility, Ace must compare
the costs and beneﬁts of working an extra hour. The cost of an extra hour of work
is the loss of an hour of leisure; this cost can be measured as the loss in utility that
Ace experiences when he must work for an hour instead of skydive. The beneﬁt of
working an extra hour is an increase of $60 in income, which allows Ace to enjoy
more consumption.
If the beneﬁt of working an extra hour (the utility gained from extra income)
exceeds the cost (the utility lost by reducing leisure), Ace should work the extra
hour. In fact, he should continue to increase his time at work until the utility he
receives from the additional income of $60 just equals the loss of utility associated
with missing an hour of leisure. Ace’s labor supply at that point is the one that max-
imizes his utility.
12
Using the idea that the labor supply decision results from a
trade-off of leisure against income, we can discuss factors that inﬂuence the amount
of labor supplied by Ace.
Real Wages and Labor Supply
The real wage is the amount of real income that a worker receives in exchange for
giving up a unit of leisure (an hour, a day, or a week, for example) for work. It is an
important determinant of the quantity of labor that is supplied.
Generally, an increase in the real wage affects the labor supply decision in two
ways. First, an increase in the real wage raises the beneﬁt (in terms of additional
real income) of working an additional hour and thus tends to make the worker
want to supply more labor. The tendency of workers to supply more labor in
response to a higher reward for working is called the substitution effect of a
higher real wage on the quantity of labor supplied.
Second, an increase in the real wage makes workers effectively wealthier
because for the same amount of work they now earn a higher real income. Some-
one who is wealthier will be better able to afford additional leisure and, as a result,
will supply less labor. The tendency of workers to supply less labor in response to
becoming wealthier is called the income effect of a higher real wage on the quan-
tity of labor supplied. Note that the substitution and income effects of a higher real
wage operate in opposite directions, with the substitution effect tending to raise the
quantity of labor supplied and the income effect tending to reduce it.
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 76
A Pure Substitution Effect: A One-Day Rise in the Real Wage. We can illustrate
the substitution effect by supposing that, after some consideration, Ace decides to
work forty-eight hours per week, by working eight hours per day for six days
each week. He leaves every Wednesday free to go skydiving. Although Ace could
work and earn $60 per hour each Wednesday, his highest utility is obtained by
taking leisure on that day instead.
Now imagine that one Tuesday, an eccentric tennis player calls Ace and
requests a lesson on Wednesday to help him prepare for a weekend amateur tour-
nament. He offers Ace his regular wage of $60 per hour, but Ace declines, explain-
ing that he plans to go skydiving on Wednesday. Not willing to take “no” for an
answer, the tennis player then offers to pay Ace $600 per hour for an all-day lesson
on Wednesday. When Ace hears this offer to work for ten times his usual wage rate,
he thinks: “I don’t get offers like this one every day. I’ll go skydiving some other
day, but this Wednesday I’m going to work.”
Ace’s decision to work rather than skydive (that is, to substitute labor for
leisure) on this particular Wednesday represents a response to a very high reward,
in terms of additional income, that each additional hour of work on that day will
bring. His decision to work the extra day results from the substitution effect.
Because receiving a very high wage for only one day doesn’t make Ace substan-
tially wealthier, the income effect of the one-day wage increase is negligible. Thus
the effect of a one-day increase in the real wage on the quantity of labor supplied
by Ace is an almost pure example of the substitution effect.
A Pure Income Effect: Winning the Lottery. In addition to skydiving, Ace enjoys
playing the state lottery. As luck would have it, a week after spending the
Wednesday teaching the eccentric tennis player, Ace wins $300,000 in the state
lottery. Ace’s response is to reduce his workweek from six to ﬁve days, because the
additional $300,000 of wealth enables him to afford to take more time off from
work—and so he does. Because the lottery prize has made him wealthier, he reduces
his labor supply. As the lottery prize does not affect the current reward for giving up
an hour of leisure to work—Ace’s wage is still $60 per hour—there is no substitution
effect. Thus, winning the lottery is an example of a pure income effect.
Another example of a pure income effect is an increase in the expected future
real wage. Suppose that the aging tennis pro at the posh country club in Ace’s com-
munity announces that he will retire the following year, and the country club
agrees to hire Ace beginning one year from now. Ace will earn $100 per hour (after
taxes) for as many hours as he wants to teach tennis.
13
Ace recognizes that this
increase in his future wage has effectively made him wealthier by increasing the
future income he will receive for any given amount of labor supplied in the future.
Looking at his lifetime income, Ace realizes that he is better able to afford leisure
today. That is, the increase in the future real wage has an income effect that leads
Ace to reduce his current labor supply. Because this increase in the future wage
does not change Ace’s current wage, and thus does not affect the current reward for
giving up an hour of leisure to work an additional hour, there is no substitution
effect on Ace’s current labor supply. Thus the increase in the future real wage has
a pure income effect on Ace’s labor supply.
13
We assume that zero inﬂation is expected over the next year, so the $100 per hour wage rate in the
following year is an increase in Ace’s real wage rate as well as an increase in his nominal wage rate.

For a detailed review of research on labor supply, see the article by Richard Blundell and Thomas
MaCurdy, “Labor Supply: A Review of Alternative Approaches,” in O. Ashenfelter and D. Card, eds.,
Handbook of Labor Economics, volume 3 (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1999), pp. 1559–1695.
The Substitution Effect and the Income Effect Together: A Long-Term Increase
in the Real Wage. The aging tennis pro at the country club quits suddenly, and
the country club asks Ace to start work immediately. Ace accepts the offer and
earns $100 per hour (after taxes) for as many hours as he wants to teach tennis.
On his new job, will Ace work more hours or fewer hours than he did before?
In this case, the two effects work in opposite directions. On the one hand, because
the reward for working is greater, Ace will be tempted to work more than he did
previously. This tendency to increase labor supply in response to a higher real
wage is the substitution effect. On the other hand, at his new, higher wage, Ace can
pay for food, rent, and skydiving expenses by working only three or four days each
week, so he is tempted to work less and spend more time skydiving. This tenden-
cy to reduce labor supply because he is wealthier is the income effect.
Which effect wins? One factor that will inﬂuence Ace’s decision is the length of
time he expects his new, higher wage to last. The longer the higher wage is expect-
ed to last, the larger its impact on Ace’s lifetime resources is, and the stronger the
income effect is. Thus, if Ace expects to hold the new job until he retires, the income
effect is strong (he is much wealthier) and he is more likely to reduce the amount
of time that he works. In contrast, if Ace believes that the job may not last very long,
the income effect is weak (the increase in his lifetime resources is small) and he may
choose to work more so as to take advantage of the higher wage while he can. In
general, the longer an increase in the real wage is expected to last, the larger the
income effect is and the more likely it is that the quantity of labor supplied will be
reduced.
Empirical Evidence on Real Wages and Labor Supply. Because of conﬂicting
income and substitution effects, some ambiguity exists regarding how a change in
the real wage will affect labor supply. What is the empirical evidence?
Research on labor supply generally shows that the aggregate amount of labor
supplied rises in response to a temporary increase in the real wage but falls in
response to a permanent increase in the real wage.
14
The ﬁnding that a temporary
increase in the real wage raises the amount of labor supplied conﬁrms the substi-
tution effect: If the reward for working rises for a short period, people will take
advantage of the opportunity to work more. The result that a permanent increase
in the real wage lowers the aggregate amount of labor supplied indicates that for
long-lived increases in the real wage, the income effect outweighs the substitution
effect: If permanently higher wages make workers much better off, they will choose
to work less. The size of these effects depends on a person’s family situation (mar-
ried or not and whether the family has children) and the tax rate (which determines
how much income can be kept after taxes are paid).
The Labor Supply Curve
We have discussed how the amount of labor supplied by an individual depends on
the current and expected future real wage rates. The labor supply curve of an indi-
vidual relates the amount of labor supplied to the current real wage rate, holding
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 78
constant all other factors (including the expected future real wage rate) that affect
the amount of labor supplied. Figure 3.7 presents a graph of a typical labor supply
curve. The current real wage is measured on the vertical axis, and the amount of
labor supplied is measured on the horizontal axis. The labor supply curve slopes
upward because an increase in the current real wage (holding constant the expect-
ed future real wage) leads to an increase in the amount of labor supplied.
Factors That Shift the Labor Supply Curve. Any factor that changes the
amount of labor supplied at a given level of the current real wage shifts the labor
supply curve. Speciﬁcally, any factor that increases the amount of labor supplied
at a given level of the real wage shifts the labor supply curve to the right, and
any factor that decreases the amount of labor supplied at a given real wage shifts
the labor supply curve to the left. We have already discussed how an increase in
wealth (say, from winning the lottery) has a pure income effect that reduces the
amount of labor supplied at a given real wage. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3.8, an
increase in wealth shifts the labor supply curve to the left. We have also
discussed how an increase in the expected future real wage has a pure income
effect that reduces the amount of labor supplied at a given real wage. Figure 3.8
also depicts the response of the labor supply curve to an increase in the expected
future real wage.
Aggregate Labor Supply
As we mentioned earlier, the aggregate supply of labor is the total amount of labor
supplied by everyone in the economy. Just as the quantity of labor supplied by an
individual rises when the person’s current real wage rises, the aggregate quantity
of labor supplied increases when the economywide real wage rises. An increase in

80 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
the current economywide real wage raises the aggregate quantity of labor supplied
for two reasons. First, when the real wage rises, people who are already working
may supply even more hours—by offering to work overtime, by changing from
part-time to full-time work, or by taking a second job. Second, a higher real wage
may entice some people who are not currently in the labor force to decide to look
for work. Because higher current real wages induce people to want to work more,
the aggregate labor supply curve—which shows the relation between the aggregate
amount of labor supplied and the current real wage—slopes upward.
Factors other than the current real wage that change the amount of labor that
people want to supply cause the aggregate labor supply curve to shift. Summary

APPLICATION
Comparing U.S. and European Labor Markets
Most of our discussion in this chapter relates to the labor market in the United
States, but the same theory and analysis apply to other countries. Although the
theory is the same, there are many differences in labor market institutions and
government policy between the United States and other countries. In this
application, we compare U.S. and European labor markets.
Economists have studied Europe’s labor markets with particular interest in the
past decade because unemployment rates in the United States and Europe were
similar in the 1970s and early 1980s but have diverged since then. In the 1990s, the
unemployment rate fell to a low level in the United States but rose to high levels in
several European countries, as Fig. 3.9 illustrates. Even in 2008, during a recession,
the U.S. unemployment rate of 5.8% was well below the rates of most countries in
Europe. Why has the U.S. labor market performed so well while most European
labor markets have stagnated?
Research has suggested several possible reasons for high unemployment in
Europe. These include generous unemployment insurance systems, high income
tax rates, and government policies that interfere with labor markets. We consider
these possible factors in turn.
European countries generally have more generous unemployment insurance
systems than the United States. For one thing, the replacement rate—the fraction of
lost wages a worker receives as unemployment payments—is higher in Europe
than in the United States. Also, unemployed European workers can receive unem-
ployment payments for a longer period than can unemployed U.S. workers. As a
result, unemployed workers have a strong incentive to remain unemployed longer
in Europe, and so the unemployment rate is higher.
Some economists have challenged the view that Europe’s generous unemploy-
ment beneﬁts have caused the high unemployment. They point out that Europe has

had generous unemployment beneﬁts for many decades, but that the high unem-
ployment rates (relative to U.S. rates) began only in the mid-1980s for most coun-
tries. However, according to Lars Ljungqvist and Thomas Sargent, European
unemployment was lower in earlier decades because the economy was tranquil in
the 1950s to 1970s, before becoming much more turbulent in the 1980s and 1990s.
15
Although there had been no need to do so in earlier decades, workers took advan-
tage of the system of unemployment beneﬁts as the chances of losing a job increased.
A country that reforms its unemployment benefits system can bring its
unemployment rate down substantially. Two cases in point are Ireland and the
Netherlands. Both countries engaged in major reforms in the 1990s, substantial-
ly reducing the generosity of unemployment benefits.
16
Ireland’s unemploy-
ment rate declined from 15.6% in 1993 to 4.3% in 2005, while the Netherlands’
unemployment rate fell from 7.7% in 1982 to 2.2% in 2001.
In Ireland and the Netherlands, however, reform of the unemployment bene-
ﬁts system was not the only change. Ireland reduced income tax rates, and the
Netherlands reduced government restrictions on part-time work.
Recall now that some economists think that it is the high income tax rates in
most European countries that largely explain Europe’s weak labor markets. Notable
in this group is Nobel laureate Edward Prescott. High income tax rates, Prescott
points out, give people little incentive to work.
17
Prescott suggests that differences
in tax rates are the main reason why Americans work so much relative to Europeans:
Americans get to keep more of what they earn and give less to the government.
Also recall that other researchers have emphasized government meddling in
labor markets as a factor in Europe’s high unemployment. Governments in Europe
generally do interfere more in labor markets than is the case in the United States.
For example, some European countries restrict ﬁrms’ ability to ﬁre workers. This
restriction causes labor supply to shift to the right and labor demand to shift to the
left. As we will consider in Chapter 11, when this happens and when wages cannot
decline to clear the labor market, unemployment increases. European governments
have interfered in the labor market in other ways as well. The Netherlands’ gov-
ernment, for example, restricted part-time work. When the government loosened
those restrictions beginning in 1982, many more women immediately entered the
labor force than before, and the unemployment rate of women fell dramatically
because labor demand increased even more than labor supply.
Thus, there is signiﬁcant evidence that unemployment rates are high in Europe
relative to the United States because of generous unemployment beneﬁts, high tax
rates, and laws that restrict part-time work. Countries that have removed these
impediments to the labor market have experienced lower unemployment rates. For
example, in 2008, the unemployment rate in the Netherlands was signiﬁcantly
lower than the unemployment rate in the United States, whereas the opposite was
true for most other European countries.

Chapter 3 Productivity, Output, and Employment 83
table 4 lists the factors that shift aggregate labor supply. We have discussed the ﬁrst
two factors in the table, wealth and the expected future real wage. Aggregate labor
supply will also increase if the country’s working-age population increases (for
example, because of an increased birth rate or immigration), or if changes in the
social or legal environment cause a greater proportion of the working-age popula-
tion to enter the labor force (increased labor force participation). For example,
evolving attitudes about the role of women in society contributed to a large
increase in the number of women in the U.S. labor market from the late 1960s to the
mid-1990s; and the elimination of mandatory retirement in many fields may
increase the participation rates of older workers.
3.4 Labor Market Equilibrium
Equilibrium in the labor market requires that the aggregate quantity of labor
demanded equal the aggregate quantity of labor supplied. The basic supply–
demand model of the labor market introduced here (called the classical model of the
labor market) is based on the assumption that the real wage adjusts reasonably quick-
ly to equate labor supply and labor demand. Thus, if labor supply is less than labor
demand, ﬁrms competing for scarce workers bid up the real wage, whereas if many
workers are competing for relatively few jobs, the real wage will tend to fall.
Labor market equilibrium is represented graphically by the intersection of the
aggregate labor demand curve and the aggregate labor supply curve at point E in
Fig. 3.10. The equilibrium level of employment, achieved after the complete adjust-
ment of wages and prices, is known as the full-employment level of employ-
ment, N. The corresponding market-clearing real wage is w.

84 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Factors that shift either the aggregate labor demand curve or the aggregate
labor supply curve affect both the equilibrium real wage and the full-employment
level of employment. An example of such a factor is a temporary adverse supply
shock. A temporary adverse supply shock—because of, say , a spell of unusually bad
weather—decreases the marginal product of labor at every level of employment. As
Fig. 3.11 shows, this decrease causes the labor demand curve to shift to the left, from
ND
1
to ND
2
. Because the supply shock is temporary, however, it is not expected to
affect future marginal products or the future real wage, so the labor supply curve
doesn’t shift. Equilibrium in the labor market moves from point A to point B. Thus
the model predicts that a temporary supply shock will lower both the current real
wage (from w
1
to w
2
) and the full-employment level of employment (from N
1
to N
2
).
The classical supply–demand model of the labor market has the virtue of sim-
plicity and is quite useful for studying how economic disturbances or changes in
economic policy affect employment and the real wage. However, a signiﬁcant
drawback of this basic model is that it cannot be used to study unemployment.
Because it assumes that any worker who wants to work at the equilibrium real
wage can ﬁnd a job, the model implies zero unemployment, which never occurs.
We discuss unemployment later in this chapter, but in the meantime we will con-
tinue to use the classical supply–demand model of the labor market.
Full-Employment Output
By combining labor market equilibrium and the production function, we can deter-
mine the amount of output that ﬁrms want to supply. Full-employment output, Y,
sometimes called potential output, is the level of output that ﬁrms in the economy
Figure 3.11

supply when wages and prices have fully adjusted. Equivalently, full-employment
output is the level of output supplied when aggregate employment equals its full-
employment level, N. Algebraically, we deﬁne full-employment output, Y, by using
the production function (Eq. 3.1):
(3.4)
Equation (3.4) shows that, for constant capital stock, K, full-employment output
is determined by two general factors: the full-employment level of employment, N,
and the production function relating output to employment.
Anything that changes either the full-employment level of employment, N, or
the production function will change full-employment output, Y. For example, an
adverse supply shock that reduces the MPN (Fig. 3.11) works in two distinct ways
to lower full-employment output:
1. The adverse supply shock lowers output directly, by reducing the quantity of
output that can be produced with any ﬁxed amounts of capital and labor.
This direct effect can be thought of as a reduction in the productivity mea-
sure A in Eq. (3.4).
2. The adverse supply shock reduces the demand for labor and thus lowers the
full-employment level of employment N, as Fig. 3.11 shows. A reduction in N
also reduces full-employment output, Y, as Eq. (3.4) conﬁrms.
Y = AF1K, N).
APPLICATION
Output, Employment, and the Real Wage During Oil Price Shocks
Among the most severe supply shocks hitting the U.S. and world economies since
World War II were sharp increases in the prices of oil and other energy products.
Figure 3.12 shows how the price of energy paid by ﬁrms, measured relative to the
GDP deflator (the general price level of all output), varied during the period
1960–2008. Three adverse oil price shocks stand out: one in 1973–1974, when the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ﬁrst imposed an oil embar-
go and then greatly increased crude oil prices; a second in 1979–1980, after the Iran-
ian revolution disrupted oil supplies; and a third in 2003–2008, when surging
demand for oil by large rapidly developing countries such as China and India,
combined with weak supply (because of insufﬁcient production capacity, hurri-
canes that damaged Gulf of Mexico production, and geopolitical concerns in the
Middle East, Russia, Venezuela, and Nigeria) caused the price of oil to rise sharply.
The 1979–1980 oil price shock turned out to be temporary, as energy prices subse-
quently fell. The increase in oil prices following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August
1990 had less of an impact on overall energy prices than the three oil price shocks
mentioned above and thus doesn’t appear as much more than a blip in Fig. 3.12.
When a reduction or disruption in the supply of oil causes energy prices to rise,
ﬁrms cut back on energy use, implying that less output is produced at any partic-
ular levels of capital and labor, which is an adverse supply shock. How large is the
effect on GDP from an oil price shock? It is difﬁcult to disentangle everything else
going on in the economy when such a shock occurs, and the outcome depends on
the government’s policy response. But empirical research suggests that an increase

M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 85
86 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
of 10% in the price of oil reduces GDP by about 0.4 percentage points.
18
Thus the
96% increase in oil prices from 2002 to 2008 leads GDP to be about 3.8% lower than
it would have been in the absence of the increase in oil prices.
Our analysis predicts that an adverse supply shock will lower labor demand,
reducing employment and the real wage, as well as reducing the supply of output.
In fact, the economy went into recession, with negative GDP growth, following the
increases in oil prices resulting from restrictions in the supply of oil in 1973-1974, 
1979–1980, and 1990. In each case, employment and the real wage fell. Care must be
taken in interpreting these results because macroeconomic policies and other fac-
tors were changing at the same time; however, our model appears to account for
the response of the economy to these major oil price increases.

3.5 Unemployment
Our classical model of the labor market, which relies on supply–demand analysis,
is useful for studying the wage rate and the level of employment in an economy
and for showing how these variables are linked to output and productivity. How-
ever, this model of the labor market is based on the strong assumption that, when
the labor market is in equilibrium, all workers who are willing to work at the pre-
vailing wage are able to ﬁnd jobs. In reality, of course, not everyone who would
like to work has a job; there is always some unemployment. The existence of

unemployment implies that, at any time, not all of society’s labor resources are
actively involved in producing goods and services.
We discuss the problem of unemployment several times in this book, notably
in Chapter 12. Here we introduce the topic by presenting some basic facts about
unemployment and then turning to a preliminary economic analysis of it.
Measuring Unemployment
To estimate the unemployment rate in the United States, each month the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) surveys about 60,000 households. Each person over age 16 in
the surveyed households is assigned to one of three categories:
1. employed, if the person worked full-time or part-time during the past week (or
was on sick leave or vacation from a job);
2. unemployed, if the person didn’t work during the past week but looked for
work during the past four weeks; or
3. not in the labor force, if the person didn’t work during the past week and didn’t
look for work during the past four weeks (examples are full-time students,
homemakers, and retirees).
Table 3.4 shows the number of people in each category in June 2009. (Good
sources for these and other data about the labor market are described in “In Touch
with Data and Research: Labor Market Data,” p. 88.) In that month there were
140.2 million employed and 14.7 million unemployed workers. The labor force
consists of all employed and unemployed workers, so in June 2009 it totaled
154.9 million workers (140.2 million employed plus 14.7 million unemployed). The
adult (over age 16) population in June 2009 was 235.7 million, which leaves
80.8 million adults not in the labor force (total population of 235.7 million less
154.9 million in the labor force).
Some useful measures of the labor market are the unemployment rate, the
participation rate, and the employment ratio. The unemployment rate is the
fraction of the labor force that is unemployed. In June 2009, the unemployment

88 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
rate was 9.5% (14. 7 million unemployed divided by 154.9 million in the labor
force). Figure 1.3 shows the U.S. unemployment rate for the period since 1890.
The fraction of the adult population in the labor force is the participation
rate. Of the 235.7 million adults in the United States in June 2009, 154.9 million
were in the labor force, so the participation rate was 65.7% (because 154.9/235.7
= 0.657 = 65.7%).
The employment ratio is the employed fraction of the adult population. In
June 2009 the employment ratio was 59.5% (140.2 million employed divided by the
adult population of 235.7 million). With an employment ratio of 59.5%, 40.5% of the
adult population was not employed in June 2009. Of this 40.5%, 6.2% reﬂected
unemployment and the remaining 34.3% reﬂected people not in the labor force.
Thus a large majority of adults who are not employed at any given time are not in
the labor force rather than unemployed.
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Labor Market Data
Government agencies collect and distribute a remarkable variety of data pertaining
to the labor market. A useful summary of labor market data can be found in The
Employment Situation, a monthly report issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(available online at www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf). This report, which is
usually released on the ﬁrst Friday of the month, includes data for the previous
month on employment, unemployment, average hours worked each week, and
average weekly and hourly earnings. The data are presented for the aggregate
U.S. economy and for various categories of workers based on age, gender, race,
occupation, and industry. Many of these data are later reprinted in a variety of
sources, including Employment and Earnings, the Economic Report of the President, and
electronic databases such as the FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
The data in The Employment Situation are obtained from two different surveys,
a household survey and an establishment survey. The household survey is the
monthly survey described in this chapter and is used to calculate employment
and the unemployment rate. The establishment survey (also known as the payroll
survey) is based on the responses of almost 400,000 business establishments about
their employment, hours worked, and employee earnings.
Both the household survey and the establishment survey provide information
on employment, but they sometimes give conﬂicting signals about what happened
to employment in the previous month. An important difference between the two
surveys is that the establishment survey counts jobs whereas the household survey
counts people. Thus a worker with two jobs could be counted twice in the estab-
lishment survey but only once in the household survey. The employment data
from the establishment survey are more comprehensive and are more closely relat-
ed to output than are the employment data from the household survey.* However,
the household survey provides information about unemployment and the estab-
lishment survey doesn’t.

Changes in Employment Status
The labor market is in a constant state of ﬂux. Even when the unemployment rate
remains unchanged from one month to the next, during the month hundreds of
thousands of U.S. workers become unemployed and hundreds of thousands
become employed.
Figure 3.13 shows how workers change their employment status (that is, whether
they are employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force) in a typical month (the
numbers are from June 2007). The arrows between each pair of boxes represent changes
from one employment status to another, and the number on each arrow shows the frac-
tion of the people in one status that switch to the other status in a typical month.
19
For
example, the arrow from the employed box to the unemployed box has the label
1%, indicating that 1% of employed workers will become unemployed by the fol-
lowing month.
What are the employment prospects of an unemployed worker? Figure 3.13
shows that 28% of the unemployed people in a typical month will be employed the
following month and that 23% of the unemployed people will be out of the labor
force the next month. The remaining 49% of the unemployed people will still be
unemployed the following month. Of the 23% of the unemployed who leave the
labor force each month, some are discouraged workers, or people who have
become so discouraged by lack of success at ﬁnding a job that they stop searching.
Other unemployed workers leave the labor force to engage in some activity outside
the labor market, such as homemaking or going to school.
How Long Are People Unemployed?
Of the 49% of those unemployed in a typical month who remain unemployed the
following month, some may remain unemployed for a considerable period of time.
The period of time that an individual is continuously unemployed is called an

unemployment spell. The length of time that an unemployment spell lasts is called
its duration. The duration of an unemployment spell determines in large part the
degree of hardship suffered by an unemployed worker. At one extreme, a one-week
unemployment spell will cost a worker a week’s pay but probably will not seri-
ously affect the worker’s standard of living. At the other extreme, an unemploy-
ment spell that lasts for several months may force an unemployed worker to
exhaust his or her life savings or to sell a car or house.
The duration of unemployment spells in the United States is characterized by
two seemingly contradictory statements:
1. Most unemployment spells are of short duration, about two months or less.
2. Most people who are unemployed on a given date are experiencing unem-
ployment spells with long duration.
To understand how both of these statements can be true, consider an economy
with 100 people in the labor force. Suppose that at the beginning of every month,
two workers become unemployed and remain unemployed for one month before
ﬁnding new jobs. In addition, at the beginning of every year four workers become
unemployed and remain unemployed for the entire year.
In this example, there are twenty-eight spells of unemployment during a year:
twenty-four spells that last one month, and four spells that last one year. Thus
twenty-four of twenty-eight, or 86%, of the spells last only one month, which is
consistent with the ﬁrst statement: Most spells are short.
How many people are unemployed on a given day—say, on May 15? There are
six unemployed workers on May 15: two unemployed workers who began one-
month spells of unemployment on May 1, and four unemployed workers who
began one-year spells of unemployment on January 1. Thus, four of six, or 67%, of
the workers unemployed on May 15 are experiencing one-year spells of unem-
ployment, which is consistent with the second statement: Most people who are
unemployed on a given date are experiencing long spells of unemployment.
Why There Always Are Unemployed People
Even when the economy is growing vigorously and many new jobs are being cre-
ated, some people remain unemployed. Why is unemployment apparently a per-
manent feature of the economy? Here we discuss frictional unemployment and
structural unemployment, two types of unemployment that always exist in the
labor market and thus prevent the unemployment rate from ever reaching zero.
Frictional Unemployment. The labor market is characterized by a great deal of
searching by both workers and ﬁrms. Unemployed workers search for suitable
jobs, and ﬁrms with vacancies search for suitable workers. If all workers were
identical and all jobs were identical, these searches would be short and easy:
Unemployed workers would simply have to ﬁnd ﬁrms that had vacancies and
they would immediately be hired. The problem, of course, is that neither jobs nor
workers are identical. Workers vary in their talents, skills, experience, goals,
geographic location (and willingness to move), and amount of time and energy
they are willing to commit to their job. Similarly, jobs vary in the skills and
experience required, working conditions, location, hours, and pay. Because of
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 90
these differences, an unemployed worker may search for several weeks or more
before ﬁnding a suitable job; similarly, a ﬁrm may search for a considerable time
before it is able to hire a suitable worker.
The unemployment that arises as workers search for suitable jobs and ﬁrms
search for suitable workers is called frictional unemployment. Because the econ-
omy is dynamic, with jobs continually being created and destroyed and workers
continually entering and exiting the labor force, there is always some frictional
unemployment as workers are matched with appropriate jobs.
Structural Unemployment. In addition to those suffering long spells of
unemployment, many people are chronically unemployed. Although their
unemployment spells may be broken by brief periods of employment or being out
of the labor force, workers who are chronically unemployed are unemployed a
large part of the time. Long spells of unemployment and chronic unemployment
can’t be attributed primarily to the matching process. People in these situations
don’t seem to search for work very intensively and don’t generally ﬁnd stable
employment. The long-term and chronic unemployment that exists even when
the economy is not in a recession is called structural unemployment.
Structural unemployment occurs for two primary reasons. First, unskilled or
low-skilled workers often are unable to obtain desirable, long-term jobs. The jobs
available to them typically offer relatively low wages and little chance for training
or advancement. Most directly related to the issue of structural unemployment is
the fact that jobs held by low-skilled workers often don’t last long. After a few
months the job may end, or the worker may quit or be ﬁred, thus entering another
spell of unemployment. Some workers with low skill levels eventually get enough
training or experience to obtain more secure, long-term jobs. Because of factors
such as inadequate education, discrimination, and language barriers, however,
some unskilled workers never make the transition to long-term employment and
remain chronically unemployed.
The second source of structural unemployment is the reallocation of labor
from industries that are shrinking, or regions that are depressed, to areas that are
growing. When industries ﬁnd that their products are no longer in demand (for
example, buggy whip manufacturers) or that they are no longer competitive (for
example, U.S. producers of color television sets that lost much of the market to pro-
ducers in Asia), workers in these industries lose their jobs. At the same time, some
industries will be growing (for example, health care providers and computer soft-
ware developers). To prevent unemployment from rising requires that workers
who lose jobs in declining industries be matched somehow with jobs in growing
industries. This matching may involve a long period of unemployment, especially
if workers need to relocate or be trained for a new job.
The Natural Rate of Unemployment. Because of the combination of frictional and
structural unemployment, an economy’s unemployment rate is never zero, even
when the economy is at its full-employment level. The rate of unemployment that
prevails when output and employment are at the full-employment level is called
the natural rate of unemployment, . The natural rate of unemployment reﬂects
unemployment owing to frictional and structural causes. Although there is no
single ofﬁcial measure of the natural rate of unemployment, many economists
believe that the natural rate was about 4% or 5% during the 1950s and increased

M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 91
92 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
gradually to about 6% in the 1980s. Many economists think that the natural rate
fell toward 5.5% or lower during the 1990s and 2000s. In Chapter 12 we discuss
the reasons for the variations in the natural rate.
As output ﬂuctuates around its full-employment level, the unemployment rate
ﬂuctuates around the natural rate. The difference between the actual unemploy-
ment rate and the natural rate of unemployment is called cyclical unemployment.
Speciﬁcally, cyclical unemployment = , where u is the actual unemployment
rate and is the natural rate. Cyclical unemployment is positive whenever the
economy’s output and employment are below full-employment levels; it is nega-
tive when output and employment exceed full-employment levels.
3.6 Relating Output and Unemployment: Okun’s Law
Earlier in this chapter we said that many short-run output ﬂuctuations result from
changes in employment. When employment falls and unemployment rises, the reduc-
tion in the number of people working leads to a decline in the quantity of goods and
services produced. We can use the concept of cyclical unemployment to provide a
more precise link between the state of the labor market and aggregate output.
The quantitative impact on aggregate output of a change in the unemployment
rate is described by Okun’s law, a rule of thumb (rather than a “law”) ﬁrst stated by
Arthur Okun, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the 1960s during
the Johnson administration. According to Okun’s law, the gap between an econo-
my’s full-employment output and its actual level of output increases by 2 percent-
age points for each percentage point the unemployment rate increases.
20,21
We
express Okun’s law algebraically as
(3.5)
The left side of Eq. (3.5) equals the amount by which actual output, Y, falls
short of full-employment output, , expressed as a percentage of . Thus Eq. (3.5)
says that the percentage gap between potential and actual output equals 2 times the
cyclical unemployment rate.
Let’s apply Okun’s law by supposing that the natural rate of unemployment is
6% and that the full-employment level of output is $15,000 billion. If the actual
unemployment rate is 7%, or 1 percentage point above the natural rate, cyclical
unemployment, , equals 1%. If cyclical unemployment is 1%, Okun’s law pre-
dicts that actual output, , will be 2% (2 times 1%) lower than full-employment
output, . Because equals $15,000 billion, Okun’s law says that actual output will
be $300 billion below the full-employment level (2% times $15,000 billion).
You may wonder why a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment
rate, which reduces employment by about 1%, leads (according to Okun’s law) to

20
When the unemployment rate increases, for example, from 6% to 9%, we say that it increases by 3
percentage points (9%–6%), or that it increases by 50 percent (3% is 50 percent of 6%).
21
In Okun’s original work (“Potential GNP: Its Measurement and Signiﬁcance,” reprinted in Arthur
Okun, The Political Economy of Prosperity, Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1970, pp. 132–145),
the “Okun’s law coefﬁcient” was about 3 rather than 2, so each percentage point of cyclical unem-
ployment was associated with a difference between actual output and full-employment output of 
3 percentage points. Current estimates put the Okun’s law coefﬁcient closer to 2.
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 92
a drop in output that is about twice as large in percentage terms. The reason is that
when cyclical unemployment increases, other factors that determine output—the
number of people in the labor force, the number of hours each worker works per
week, the average productivity of labor—also fall, which magniﬁes the effect of the
increase in unemployment. Numerical Problem 10 at the end of this chapter illus-
trates this point.
Sometimes we express Okun’s law in a slightly different form:
(3.6)
where is the percentage growth rate of output and is the change in the
actual unemployment rate from one year to the next. Equation (3.6) says that when
unemployment is rising ( ), actual output, Y, is growing more slowly than
3% per year, which is the average growth rate of full-employment output in the
United States. Equation (3.6), which requires the assumption that the natural rate
of unemployment is constant, is called the growth rate form of Okun’s law. See
Appendix 3.A at the end of this chapter for a derivation of Eq. (3.6).
Figure 3.14 illustrates the growth rate form of Okun’s law. The ﬁgure shows the
relation between the annual change in the unemployment rate (measured on the
horizontal axis) and the annual growth rate of U.S. output (measured on the verti-
cal axis) for the period 1951–2008. Line OL in this ﬁgure represents Okun’s law. Its
slope is -2, indicating that a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate
is associated with a 2% drop in output. The vertical line rising from 0 on the hori-
zontal axis intersects OL at 3%. This intercept indicates that, when no change
occurs in the unemployment rate, the growth rate of actual output is 3%, or the
approximate average growth rate of full-employment output in the United States.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. The production function tells us the amount of output
that can be produced with any given quantities of
capital and labor. It can be graphed as a relationship
between output and capital, holding labor ﬁxed, or as
a relationship between output and labor, holding cap-
ital fixed. In either case, the production function
slopes upward, implying that greater use of capital or
labor leads to more output. A shift in the production
function, which indicates a change in the amount of
output that can be produced with given amounts of
capital and labor, is called a supply shock.
2. The extra output that can be produced when the cap-
ital stock is increased by one unit, with labor held con-
stant, is called the marginal product of capital (MPK).
In a graph of the production function relating output
to capital, the MPK can be measured as the slope of the
production function. The MPK falls as the capital stock
increases, reﬂecting the diminishing marginal produc-
tivity of capital. Similarly, the marginal product of
labor (MPN) is the extra output that can be produced
when labor increases by one unit, with capital held
constant. The MPN—which can be measured as the
slope of the production function relating output to
labor—falls as employment rises, indicating that labor
also has diminishing marginal productivity.
3. To maximize proﬁts, ﬁrms demand labor to the point
that the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPN)
equals the nominal wage, W; or, equivalently, to the
point that the MPN equals the real wage, w.
4. The labor demand curve is identical to the MPN
curve. Because an increase in the real wage causes
ﬁrms to demand less labor, the labor demand curve
slopes downward. Factors that increase the amount
of labor demanded at any real wage, such as a bene-
ﬁcial supply shock or an increase in the capital stock,
shift the labor demand curve to the right. Aggregate
labor demand is the sum of the labor demands of
ﬁrms in the economy.
5. An individual’s decision about how much labor to
supply reflects a comparison of the benefit and cost
of working an additional hour. The benefit of work-
ing an additional hour is the additional real income
earned, which can be used to increase consump-
tion. The cost of working an extra hour is the loss of
an hour’s leisure. An individual’s happiness, or
utility, is maximized by supplying labor to the
point where the cost of working an extra hour (the
utility lost because of reduced leisure) equals the
benefit (the utility gained because of increased
income).
6. An increase in the real wage has competing substitution
and income effects on the amount of labor supplied.
The substitution effect of a higher real wage increases
the amount of labor supplied, as the worker responds to
the increased reward for working. The income effect
reduces the amount of labor supplied, as the higher real
wage makes the worker wealthier and thus able to
afford a greater amount of leisure. The longer an
increase in the real wage is expected to last, the stronger
the income effect is. Thus a temporary increase in the
real wage will increase the amount of labor supplied. A
permanent increase in the real wage will increase the
amount of labor supplied by a smaller amount than a
temporary increase in the real wage of the same size,
however, and may even lead to a decrease in the
amount of labor supplied.
7. The labor supply curve relates the amount of labor
supplied to the current real wage. The labor supply
curve slopes upward, indicating that an increase in
the current real wage—with other factors, includ-
ing the expected future real wage, held fixed—
raises the amount of labor supplied. Factors that
decrease the quantity of labor supplied at the cur-
rent real wage, and thus shift the labor supply curve
to the left, include an increase in wealth and an
increase in the expected future real wage. Aggre-
gate labor supply, which is the sum of labor sup-
plies of the individuals in the economy, is also
influenced by changes in the adult population and
social or legal factors that affect the number of
people participating in the labor market.
8. The classical supply–demand model of the labor
market is based on the assumption that the real wage
adjusts relatively quickly to equalize the quantities of
labor demanded and supplied. The equilibrium level
of employment, which arises when wages and prices
in the economy have fully adjusted, is called the full-
employment level of employment. Fluctuations in
employment and the real wage result from factors
that shift the labor supply curve and/or the labor
demand curve.
9. Full-employment output, or potential output, is the
amount of output produced when employment is at
its full-employment level. Increases in the full-
employment level of employment or beneficial
supply shocks increase the full-employment level of
output.
10. Adults without jobs are classiﬁed as unemployed if
they looked for work during the preceding four
weeks; they are classiﬁed as not in the labor force if
they haven’t been looking for work. The labor force
consists of all employed workers plus all unem-
ployed workers. The unemployment rate is the frac-
tion of the labor force that is unemployed.
M03_ABEL4529_07_SE_C03.QXD  12/9/09  3:30 PM  Page 94
11. Frictional unemployment reﬂects the time required
for potential workers to find suitable jobs and for
ﬁrms with vacancies to ﬁnd suitable workers. Struc-
tural unemployment—long-term and chronic unem-
ployment that exists even when the economy isn’t in
recession—occurs because some workers don’t have
the skills needed to obtain long-term employment,
or because of delays as workers relocate from eco-
nomically depressed areas to those that are growing.
■ The production function becomes ﬂatter from left to
right, implying that the larger the capital stock
already is, the less extra output is gained by adding
another unit of capital. The fact that extra capital
becomes less productive as the capital stock grows is
called diminishing marginal productivity of capital.
■ With labor held constant, if an increase in capital of
ΔK leads to an increase in output of ΔY, then ΔY/ΔK is
called the marginal product of capital, or MPK. The
MPK is measured graphically by the slope of the line
tangent to the production function. For example, in
the diagram the MPK when the capital stock is K
1
equals the slope of the line tangent to the production
function at point B.
Factors That Shift the Curve

The production
function
The production function
indicates how much
output an economy or a
ﬁrm can produce with
any given quantities of
capital and labor.
Frictional and structural unemployment together
account for the natural rate of unemployment, which
is the unemployment rate that exists when employ-
ment is at its full-employment level. Cyclical unem-
ployment is the excess of the actual unemployment
rate over the natural rate of unemployment.
12. According to Okun’s law, a 1 percentage point
increase in the rate of cyclical unemployment reduces
output by 2 percent.
Diagram Elements
■ The production function graphed here has the
amount of output produced, Y, on the vertical axis
and the quantity of capital used, K, on the horizontal
axis, with labor, N, held constant. It can also be drawn
as a relationship between output and labor, with cap-
ital held constant. The production function relating
output to labor looks like the graph shown here.
■ The equation for the production function is Y =
AF(K, N), where A (total factor productivity, or
simply productivity) measures how effectively the
economy uses capital and labor.
Analysis
■ The production function slopes upward, reﬂecting the
fact that an increase in the quantity of capital will
allow more output to be produced.

■ The labor demand curve, ND, shows the amount of labor

the same as the MPN curve, which shows the marginal
product of labor at each level of employment.

The labor supply curve slopes upward because an

held constant, increases the amount of labor supplied.

■ Equilibrium in the labor market occurs when the
quantity of labor demanded equals the quantity
of labor supplied. In the figure, equilibrium
employment is and the equilibrium real wage
is . The equilibrium level of employment,
which occurs after wages and prices have fully
adjusted, is called the full-employment level of
employment.
Factors That Shift the Curves
■ Any factor that increases the amount of labor
demanded at a given current real wage shifts the
labor demand curve to the right. Such factors include
an increase in productivity that increases the margin-
al product of labor and an increase in the capital
stock. See Summary table 3 on page 74.
■ Any factor that increases the amount of labor sup-
plied at a given current real wage shifts the labor
supply curve to the right. Such factors include a
decline in wealth, a drop in the expected future real
wage, an increase in the adult population, and an
increase in labor force participation. See Summary
table 4 on page 80.

supply shock—shifts the production function upward.
Examples of beneficial supply shocks include new
inventions and improved management techniques.
■ Any change that reduces the amount of output that
can be produced for given quantities of capital and
labor—an adverse supply shock—shifts the produc-
tion function downward. Examples of adverse supply
shocks include bad weather and the depletion of nat-
ural resources.

KEY EQUATIONS
(3.1)
The production function indicates how much output, Y, can
be produced for given quantities of capital, K, and labor,
N, and for a given level of total factor productivity, A.
(3.4)
Full-employment output, , is the quantity of output sup-
plied by ﬁrms when wages and prices have fully adjusted,
and employment equals its equilibrium value, .
(3.5)
Okun’s law states that a 1 percentage point increase in the
unemployment rate, u, reduces output, Y, by 2% of the
Y - Y
Y
 = 2(u - u q)
N
Y
Y = AF(K, N)
Y = AF(K, N) full-employment level of output, . When the unemploy-
ment rate equals the natural rate of unemployment, ,
output equals its full-employment level.
(3.6)
The growth rate form of Okun’s law relates the growth rate
of output, ΔY/Y, to the average growth rate of full-employ-
ment output in the United States, 3%, and the change in
the unemployment rate, Δu. According to Eq. (3.6), output
grows more slowly than full-employment output when
unemployment is rising and more quickly than full-
employment output when unemployment is falling. This
version of Okun’s law is based on the assumption that the
natural rate of unemployment is constant.

b. Repeat part (a) for A = 2.0.
5. Consider an economy in which the marginal product of
labor MPN is MPN= 309 - 2N, where N is the amount of
labor used. The amount of labor supplied, NS, is given
by NS = 22 + 12w+ 2T, where w is the real wage and T is
a lump-sum tax levied on individuals.
a. Use the concepts of income effect and substitution
effect to explain why an increase in lump-sum

7. Consider an economy with 500 people in the labor force.
At the beginning of every month, 5 people lose their jobs

by using only the change in the unemployment rate,
the growth rate of output, and the growth rate ver-
sion of Okun’s law, , which

ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. a. A technological breakthrough raises a country’s
total factor productivity A by 10%. Show how this
change affects the graphs of both the production
function relating output to capital and the produc-
tion function relating output to labor.
b. Show that a 10% increase in A also increases the MPK
and the MPN by 10% at any level of capital and labor.
(Hint: What happens to ΔY for any increase in capital,
ΔK, or for any increase in labor, ΔN?)
c. Can a beneﬁcial supply shock leave the MPK and
MPN unaffected? Show your answer graphically.
2. How would each of the following affect the current level
of full-employment output? Explain.
a. A large number of immigrants enter the country.
b. Energy supplies become depleted.
c. New teaching techniques improve the educational
performance of high school seniors.
d. A new law mandates the shutdown of some unsafe
forms of capital.
3. During the 1980s and 1990s the average rate of unem-
ployment in Europe was high. Some economists claimed
that this rate was in part the result of “real-wage rigidi-
ty,” a situation in which unions kept real wages above
their market-clearing levels.
a. Accepting for the sake of argument that real wages
were too high in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s,
show how this situation would lead to unemploy-
ment (a situation where people who would like to
work at the going wage cannot ﬁnd jobs).
b. What is the effect of real-wage rigidity on the output
actually supplied by ﬁrms, relative to the output they
would supply if there were no real-wage rigidity?
4. How would each of the following affect Helena Hand-
basket’s supply of labor?
a. The value of Helena’s home triples in an unexpect-
edly hot real estate market.
b. Originally an unskilled worker, Helena acquires
skills that give her access to a higher-paying job.
Assume that her preferences about leisure are not
affected by the change in jobs.
c. A temporary income tax surcharge raises the per-
centage of her income that she must pay in taxes,
for the current year only. (Taxes are proportional to
income in Helena’s country.)
5. Suppose that under a new law all businesses must pay
a tax equal to 6% of their sales revenue. Assume that this
tax is not passed on to consumers. Instead, consumers
pay the same prices after the tax is imposed as they did
before. What is the effect of this tax on labor demand? If
the labor supply curve is unchanged, what will be the
effect of the tax on employment and the real wage?
6. Can the unemployment rate and the employment
ratio rise during the same month? Can the participa-
tion rate fall at the same time that the employment
ratio rises? Explain.
7. Self-employed workers in the United States must pay
Social Security taxes equal to 12.4% of any income up
to $106,800 in 2009. This income level of $106,800 is
known as the “cap.” Income in excess of the cap is not
subject to Social Security tax, so self-employed work-
ers with incomes exceeding $106,800 pay $106,800 
0.124 = $13,243. Now consider two proposals designed
to increase Social Security tax revenue. Proposal A
increases the cap to $129,194, so that Social Security
taxes equal 12.4% of income up to $129,194. Proposal B
increases the Social Security tax rate to 15%, but leaves
the cap unchanged at $106,800. For people with
income that always exceeds the cap, the amount of
Social Security tax is the same under Proposal A
($129,194 × 0.124 = $16,020) as under Proposal B
($106,800 × 0.15 = $16,020). There are no planned
changes in future Social Security beneﬁts anticipated
by current workers.
a. Sally is self-employed and earns $150,000 per year.
What are the effects of Proposal A and Proposal B
on Sally’s labor supply? Under which proposal
would she supply a greater amount of labor?
Explain your answers using the concepts of income
effect and substitution effect.
b. Fred is self-employed and earns $50,000 per year.
What are the effects of Proposal A and Proposal B
on Fred’s labor supply? Under which proposal
would he supply a greater amount of labor?
Explain your answers using the concepts of income
effect and substitution effect.

The Growth Rate Form of Okun’s Law
To derive the growth rate form of Okun’s law, Eq. (3.6), we start with the basic form
of Okun’s law, Eq. (3.5):
(3.5)
After multiplying by -1, we rewrite Eq. (3.5) as
We now calculate the change from the previous year to the current year for
each side of this equation. Setting the change on the left side equal to the change on
the right side, and assuming that is constant (so that ), we get
The left side of this equation, which is the change in , is very close to the
growth rate of , which is . (To go from the change to the growth
rate, we divide by , which is a number close to 1.) Approximating the change
in by its growth rate, and using the formula that states that the growth rate of
a ratio is the growth rate of the numerator minus the growth rate of the denomi-
nator (Appendix A, Section A.7), we rewrite the equation once more as
In the United States, the average growth rate of full-employment output is 3% per
year. Substituting 3% into this equation and rearranging gives the growth rate
form of Okun’s law, Eq. (3.6).

CHAPTER 4
Consumption, Saving, 
and Investment
In Chapter 3 we focused on some of the factors determining the amount of output
produced, or supplied, in the economy. In this chapter we consider the factors that
underlie the economywide demand for goods and services. In other words, we move
from examining how much is produced to examining how that production is used.
Recall from Chapter 2 that aggregate demand (spending) in the economy
has four components: the demand for consumer goods and services by house-
holds (consumption), the demand for new capital goods by ﬁrms and new homes
by households (investment), government purchases of goods and services, and
the net demand for domestic goods by foreigners (net exports). Because the level
of government purchases is determined primarily by the political process, macro-
economic analysis usually treats that component of spending as given. For this
chapter we also assume that the economy is closed so that net exports are zero
(we drop the closed-economy assumption in Chapter 5). That leaves two major
components of spending—consumption and investment—to be discussed in this
chapter. In Section 4.1 we present the factors that determine how much house-
holds choose to consume, and in Section 4.2 we look at the decision by ﬁrms
about how much to invest.
We have said that this chapter is about the aggregate demand for goods and
services. However, we could just as easily say that it is about a seemingly very dif-
ferent (but equally important) topic: the determination of saving and capital for-
mation. Studying the aggregate demand for goods and services is the same as
studying the factors that determine saving and capital formation for the following
reasons. First, saving is simply what is left after an economic unit (say , a household)
decides how much of its income to consume. Thus the decision about how much to
consume is the same as the decision about how much to save. Second, investment
spending is part of the aggregate demand for goods and services, but it also repre-
sents the acquisition of new capital goods by ﬁrms. In studying investment spend-
ing, we therefore are also looking at the factors that lead an economy to acquire new
factories, machines, and housing. In effect, we do two things at once in this chapter:
■ We explore the determinants of the aggregate demand for goods, which pre-
pares you for future discussions of topics such as the role of spending ﬂuctua-
tions in business cycles.
■ While exploring aggregate demand we also examine the factors affecting
saving and capital formation, which prepares you for future discussions of
the sources of economic growth and other issues.

104 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
In making many economic decisions, including those we consider in this
chapter, people must trade off the present against the future. In deciding how
much to consume and save, for example, a household must weigh the beneﬁts of
enjoying more consumption today against the beneﬁts of putting aside some of its
income as saving for the future. Similarly, in deciding how much to invest, a ﬁrm’s
manager must determine how much to spend today so as to increase the ﬁrm’s pro-
ductive capacity one, ﬁve, or even twenty years from now. In making these trade-
offs, households and ﬁrms must take into account their expectations about the
future of the economy, including expectations about government policy.
In Chapter 3 we asked, What forces act to bring the labor market into equilib-
rium? We close this chapter by asking the same question for the goods market. The
goods market is in equilibrium when the quantity of goods and services that pro-
ducers want to supply (discussed in Chapter 3) equals the quantity of goods and
services demanded by households, ﬁrms, and the government (discussed in this
chapter). Equivalently, the goods market is in equilibrium when desired saving in
the economy equals desired investment. We show that the real interest rate plays a
key role in bringing the goods market into equilibrium.
4.1 Consumption and Saving
We begin consideration of the demand for goods and services by discussing the
factors that affect consumer spending. Because consumption spending by households
is by far the largest component of the demand for goods and services—accounting for
more than two-thirds of total spending in the United States—changes in consumers’
willingness to spend have major implications for the behavior of the economy.
Besides the sheer size of consumption spending, another reason to study
consumption is that the individual’s or household’s decision about how much to
consume is closely linked to another important economic decision, the decision
about how much to save. Indeed, for given levels of disposable income, the deci-
sion about how much to consume and the decision about how much to save are
really the same decision. For example, a college student with a part-time job that
pays $4000 per year after taxes might decide to spend $3700 per year on clothes,
food, entertainment, and other consumption. If she does consume this amount, her
saving will automatically be $300 ($4000 minus $3700) per year. Equivalently, she
might decide to save $300 per year. If she succeeds in saving $300, her consumption
automatically is $3700 ($4000 minus $300) per year. Because the decision about how
much to consume and the decision about how much to save actually are two sides
of the same coin, we analyze them together.
From a macroeconomic perspective, we are interested in the aggregate, or
national, levels of consumption and saving. We deﬁne the national level of desired
consumption, , as the aggregate quantity of goods and services that households
want to consume, given income and other factors that determine households’ eco-
nomic opportunities. We will analyze desired consumption and its response to
various factors, such as income and interest rates, by examining the consumption
decisions of individual households. The aggregate level of desired consumption, ,
is obtained by adding up the desired consumption of all households. Thus any
factor that increases the desired consumption of individual households will
increase , and any factor that decreases the desired consumption of individual
households will decrease . C

Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment 105
Just as a household’s consumption decision and saving decision are closely
linked, a country’s desired consumption is closely linked to its desired national
saving. Speciﬁcally, desired national saving, , is the level of national saving that
occurs when aggregate consumption is at its desired level. Recall from Chapter 2
(Eq. 2.8) that if net factor payments from abroad (NFP) equal zero (as must be true
in a closed economy), national saving, , equals , where is output, 
is consumption, and is government purchases. Because desired national saving,
, is the level of national saving that occurs when consumption equals its desired
level, we obtain an expression for desired national saving by substituting desired
consumption, , for consumption, , in the deﬁnition of national saving. This
substitution yields
(4.1)
We can gain insight into the factors that affect consumption and saving at the
national level by considering how consumption and saving decisions are made at
the individual level. Appendix 4.A provides a more formal analysis of this decision-
making process.
The Consumption and Saving Decision of an Individual
Let’s consider the case of Prudence, a bookkeeper for the Spectacular Eyeglasses
Company. Prudence earns $60,000 per year after taxes. Hence she could, if she
chose, consume $60,000 worth of goods and services every year. Prudence, how-
ever, has two other options.
First, she can save by consuming less than $60,000 per year. Why should Pru-
dence consume less than her income allows? The reason is that she is thinking
about the future. By consuming less than her current income, she will accumulate
savings that will allow her, at some time in the future, to consume more than her
income. For example, Prudence may expect her income to be very low when she
retires; by saving during her working life, she will be able to consume more than
her income during retirement. Indeed, the desire to provide for retirement is an
important motivation for saving in the real world.
Alternatively, Prudence could consume more than her current income by bor-
rowing or by drawing down previously accumulated savings. If she borrows $5000
from a bank, for example, she could consume as much as $65,000 worth of goods
and services this year even though her income is only $60,000. Consuming more
than her income is enjoyable for Prudence, but the cost to her is that at some future
time, when she must repay the loan, she will have to consume less than her income.
If Prudence consumes less today, she will be able to consume more in the
future, and vice versa. In other words, she faces a trade-off between current con-
sumption and future consumption. The rate at which Prudence trades off current
and future consumption depends on the real interest rate prevailing in the economy.
Suppose that Prudence can earn a real interest rate of per year on her saving
and, for simplicity, suppose that if she borrows, she must pay the same real inter-
est rate on the loan. These assumptions imply that Prudence can trade one unit of
current (this year’s) consumption for units of future (next year’s) consump-
tion. For example, suppose Prudence reduces her consumption today by one dollar,
thereby increasing her saving by one dollar. Because she earns a real interest rate of
on her saving, the dollar she saves today will be worth dollars one year 1 + r r

from now.

Under the assumption that Prudence uses the extra dollars to
increase her next year’s consumption, she has effectively traded one dollar’s worth
of consumption today for dollars of consumption a year from now.
Similarly, Prudence can trade real dollars of future consumption for one
extra dollar of consumption today. She does so by borrowing and spending an
extra dollar today. In a year she will have to repay the loan with interest, a total of
dollars. Because she has to repay dollars next year, her consumption
next year will be dollars less than it would be otherwise. So the “price” to
Prudence of one dollar’s worth of extra consumption today is dollars’ worth
of consumption in the future.
The real interest rate determines the relative price of current consumption and
future consumption. Given this relative price, how should Prudence choose
between consuming today and consuming in the future? One extreme possibility
would be for her to borrow heavily and consume much more than her income
today. The problem with this strategy is that, after repaying her loan, Prudence
would be able to consume almost nothing in the future. The opposite, but equally
extreme, approach would be for Prudence to save nearly all of her current income.
This strategy would allow her to consume a great deal in the future, but at the cost
of near-starvation today.
Realistically, most people would choose neither of those extreme strategies
but would instead try to avoid sharp ﬂuctuations in consumption. The desire to
have a relatively even pattern of consumption over time—avoiding periods of
very high or very low consumption—is known as the consumption-smoothing
motive. Because of her consumption-smoothing motive, Prudence will try to
spread her consumption spending more or less evenly over time, rather than binge-
ing in one period and starving in another.
Next, we will see how the consumption-smoothing motive guides Prudence’s
behavior when changes occur in some important determinants of her economic
well-being, including her current income, her expected future income, and her
wealth. As we consider each of these changes, we will hold constant the real inter-
est rate and, hence, the relative price of current consumption and future con-
sumption. Later, we will discuss what happens if the real interest rate changes.
Effect of Changes in Current Income
Current income is an important factor affecting consumption and saving decisions.
To illustrate, suppose that Prudence receives a one-time bonus of $6000 at work,
which increases her current year’s income by $6000. (We ignore income taxes;
equivalently, we can assume that the bonus is actually larger than $6000 but that,
after paying her taxes, Prudence ﬁnds that her current income has increased by
$6000.) What will she do with this extra income? Prudence could splurge and
spend the entire bonus on a trip to Hawaii. If she spends the entire bonus, her cur-
rent consumption will increase by $6000 but, because she has not increased her
saving, her future consumption will be unchanged. Alternatively, she could save
the entire bonus, leaving her current consumption unchanged but using the bonus

We are assuming that there is zero inﬂation over the coming year, so that $1 purchases the same
amount of real goods in each period. Alternatively, we could say that since the real interest rate is ,
each real dollar Prudence saves today will be worth real dollars one year from now. 1 + r

plus the interest it earns to increase her consumption in the future. Because of the
consumption-smoothing motive, however, Prudence is unlikely to follow either of
these extreme strategies. Instead, she will spend part of the bonus (increasing
current consumption) and save the rest (enabling her to increase future
consumption as well).
The portion of her bonus that Prudence spends will depend on factors such as
her willingness to defer gratiﬁcation and her assessment of her current and future
needs. We deﬁne Prudence’s marginal propensity to consume, or MPC, as the
fraction of additional current income that she consumes in the current period.
Because Prudence consumes some but not all of her extra income, her MPC will be
between zero and one. Suppose, for example that Prudence has an MPC equal to
0.4, so that she consumes 0.4, or 40%, of an increase in current income. Then, when
she receives a $6000 bonus, Prudence will increase her current consumption by
. Because the part of income that is not consumed is saved,
her saving also increases by the amount of .
The marginal propensity to consume also applies to declines in current income.
For example, if Prudence were temporarily laid off from her bookkeeping job so
that her current year’s income decreased by $8000, she would reduce both her
consumption and her saving. If we assume that her marginal propensity to con-
sume remains 0.4, she would reduce her consumption by ,
and her saving would therefore have to diminish by .
Aggregate income and consumption reﬂect the decisions of millions of indi-
viduals and households, so that the lessons we learned from thinking about the
case of Prudence also apply at the macroeconomic level. Just as an increase in Pru-
dence’s income caused her to consume more, we would expect an increase in
aggregate output (income) to lead to an increase in aggregate desired consump-
tion, , as well. Because marginal propensities to consume are less than 1, how-
ever, the increase in will be less than the increase in . As not all of the increase
in is spent, desired national saving will also rise when rises.
Effect of Changes in Expected Future Income
Today’s consumption decisions may depend not only on current income, but also
on the income that one expects to earn in the future. For example, an individual
who is currently not employed but who has a contract to begin a high-paying job
in three months will probably consume more today than another unemployed
individual with no job prospects.
To illustrate the effect of changes in expected future income, suppose that
instead of receiving the $6000 bonus during the current year, Prudence learns that
she will receive a $6000 bonus (after taxes) next year. The promise of the bonus is
legally binding, and Prudence has no doubt that she will receive the extra income
next year. How will this information affect Prudence’s consumption and saving in
the current year?
Because her current income is unaffected, Prudence could leave her current
consumption and saving unchanged, waiting until she actually receives the bonus
to increase her consumption. If her decisions are guided by a consumption-smooth-
ing motive, however, she will prefer to use the bonus to increase her current con-
sumption as well as her future consumption. She can increase her current
consumption, despite the fact that her current income remains unchanged, by reduc-
ing her current saving (she could even “dissave,” or have negative current saving,

108 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
with current consumption exceeding current income, by using her accumulated
assets or by borrowing). Suppose, for example, that Prudence decides to consume
$1000 more this year. Because her current income is unchanged, Prudence’s $1000
increase in current consumption is equivalent to a $1000 reduction in current saving.
The $1000 reduction in current saving will reduce Prudence’s available
resources in the next year, relative to the situation in which her saving is
unchanged, by . For example, if the real interest rate is 0.05, cutting
current saving by $1000 reduces Prudence’s available resources next year by
. Overall, her available resources next year will increase by
$6000 because of the bonus but will decrease by $1050 because of reduced current
saving, giving a net increase in resources of , which can be
used to increase consumption next year or in the following years. Effectively, Pru-
dence can use the increase in her expected future income to increase consumption
both in the present and in the future.
To summarize, an increase in an individual’s expected future income is likely
to lead that person to increase current consumption and decrease current saving.
The same result applies at the macroeconomic level: If people expect that aggregate
output and income, , will be higher in the future, current desired consumption, ,
should increase and current desired national saving, , should decrease.
Economists can’t measure expected future income directly, so how do they
take this variable into account when predicting consumption and saving behavior?
One approach is to survey consumers and ask them about their expectations. Their
answers can be useful for assessing developments in the macroeconomy, as the
Application “Consumer Sentiment and Forecasts of Consumer Spending” shows.

APPLICATION
Consumer Sentiment and Forecasts of Consumer Spending
Indexes that focus on consumer sentiment are widely reported in the press. The
University of Michigan, The Conference Board, and ABC News/Washington Post
each conduct their own survey, in which they ask consumers about their percep-
tions of current and future economic conditions. Consumer sentiment is closely
associated with consumer spending. News about the stock market, wars, and elec-
tions causes consumer sentiment to change and affects consumer spending.
Economists on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve pay attention to the
indexes, thinking that they provide useful information about future spending by
consumers. But do they? The question is: Even if consumer sentiment today is
closely associated with consumer spending today, can consumer sentiment help
economists forecast future consumer spending? Recent research suggests that these
measures of consumer sentiment may not be helpful in doing so.
To see whether indexes of consumer sentiment facilitate accurate forecasting,
we begin by examining the data. Figure 4.1 shows the monthly values of the Uni-
versity of Michigan (U of M) index, plotted over time from January 1978 to May
2009, with shaded bars indicating when the economy was in a recession.

The Conference Board survey and the ABC News/Washington Post survey show similar results. As
their data are not as readily available as the University of Michigan survey data, we focus here on the
U of M survey data.

The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index turns down sharply
during recessions. But it does not always give any warning before a recession
begins, and it often turns down sharply but no recession occurs. Thus, the con-
sumer sentiment index may not be useful for forecasting recessions.
If consumer sentiment indexes help economists on Wall Street and at the Federal
Reserve forecast any economic variables, the likeliest such variable is consumer
spending. We know that people base their spending decisions on their incomes and
other variables, and it is a reasonable conjecture that their views of the current and
future state of the economy would inﬂuence their consumption decisions.
To see whether consumer sentiment indexes are correlated with people’s
spending decisions, we look at the data in Fig. 4.2. The ﬁgure shows values from
1978 to 2009 of the U of M index of consumer sentiment (the scale on the left verti-
cal axis) compared with consumer spending (the scale on the right vertical axis), as
measured by the percentage change in consumer spending from the same month
one year earlier (so the value reported for May 2009 is the percentage change in the
amount of consumer spending in May 2009 from its value in May 2008).
The general movements of the two series correspond fairly closely (the correla-
tion between them is 0.71). They declined together from 1978 to 1980, rose sharply
together after the recession ended in 1982, and drifted slowly downward together in
the 1980s. In the 1990s, the University of Michigan index rose earlier than the growth
rate of consumption spending, but both were very high in the late 1990s and fell
together in the early 2000s. Both series moved down sharply in 2007 and 2008.
Sometimes, however, the consumer sentiment index moves differently than
consumer spending. For example, consumer sentiment fell sharply in 1978, but con-
sumer spending grew briskly throughout the year and did not exhibit substantially
slower growth until the spring of 1979. We ﬁnd another example in late 1998, when

the Russian government defaulted on its debt and a large hedge fund failed, leading
to chaotic ﬁnancial conditions around the world. Consumer sentiment declined
sharply, but consumer spending was unaffected.
So there are reasons to think that consumer sentiment might be useful in fore-
casting consumer spending, as well as reasons to think it may not be helpful. The
only way to tell is to use formal statistical methods to test whether consumer senti-
ment improves the forecasting performance of a model.
Jason Bram of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Sydney Ludvigson of
New York University examined the use of consumer sentiment indexes in forecast-
ing consumer spending.
3
They asked the question: If a forecaster used a model to
forecast the amount of consumer spending in the next three months, would those
forecasts be improved if the forecaster included data on consumer sentiment in the
model? Bram and Ludvigson found that for forecasting changes in consumer spend-
ing, a model including past consumer spending, personal income, stock prices,
and interest rates is good, and the model’s forecasts would not be improved by
adding either the University of Michigan index or The Conference Board index.
Consumer sentiment indexes usefully inform us about consumers’ perceptions
of the current and future state of the economy and help to explain past changes in
consumer spending. But they do not appear to be useful in forecasting consumer
spending. Consumers may be worried about the current economic situation, but it
appears that their future spending is governed mainly by their incomes and ﬁnan-
cial variables, not by current consumer sentiment.

Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment 111
Effect of Changes in Wealth
Another factor that affects consumption and saving is wealth. Recall from Chapter 2
that the wealth of any entity, such as a household or an entire nation, equals its
assets minus its liabilities.
To see how consumption and saving respond to an increase in wealth, suppose
that while cleaning out her attic Prudence ﬁnds a stock certiﬁcate for 50 shares of
stock in a pharmaceutical company. Prudence’s grandmother bought this stock
for Prudence when she was born, and Prudence did not know about it. She imme-
diately calls her broker and learns that the stock is now worth $6000. This unex-
pected $6000 increase in Prudence’s wealth has the same effect on her available
resources as the $6000 increase in current income that we examined earlier. As in
the case involving an increase in her current income, Prudence will use her increase
in wealth to increase her current consumption by an amount smaller than $6000 so
that she can use some of the additional $6000 to increase her future consumption.
Because Prudence’s current income is not affected by ﬁnding the stock certiﬁcate,
the increase in her current consumption is matched by a decrease in current saving
of the same size. In this way, an increase in wealth increases current consumption
and reduces current saving. The same line of reasoning leads to the conclusion that
a decrease in wealth reduces current consumption and increases saving.
The ups and downs in the stock market are an important source of changes in
wealth, and the effects on consumption of changes in the stock market are explored
in the Application, “Macroeconomic Consequences of the Boom and Bust in Stock
Prices,” p. 138.
Effect of Changes in the Real Interest Rate
We have seen that the real interest rate is the price of current consumption in terms
of future consumption. We held the real interest rate ﬁxed when we examined the
effects of changes in current income, expected future income, and wealth. Now we
let the real interest rate vary, examining the effect on current consumption and
saving of changes in the real interest rate.
How would Prudence’s consumption and saving change in response to an
increase in the real interest rate? Her response to such an increase reﬂects two
opposing tendencies. On the one hand, because each real dollar of saving in the
current year grows to real dollars next year, an increase in the real interest
rate means that each dollar of current saving will have a higher payoff in terms of
increased future consumption. This increased reward for current saving tends to
increase saving.
On the other hand, a higher real interest rate means that Prudence can achieve
any future savings target with a smaller amount of current saving. For example,
suppose that she is trying to accumulate $1400 to buy a new laptop computer next
year. An increase in the real interest rate means that any current saving will grow
to a larger amount by next year, so the amount that she needs to save this year to
reach her goal of $1400 is lower. Because she needs to save less to reach her goal,
she can increase her current consumption and thus reduce her saving.
The two opposing effects described above are known as the substitution effect
and the income effect of an increase in the real interest rate. The substitution effect
of the real interest rate on saving reﬂects the tendency to reduce current con-
sumption and increase future consumption as the price of current consumption,
1 + r
M04_ABEL4529_07_SE_C04.QXD  12/11/09  1:41 AM  Page 111
112 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
, increases. In response to an increase in the price of current consumption,
consumers substitute away from current consumption, which has become relatively
more expensive, toward future consumption, which has become relatively less
expensive. The reduction in current consumption implies that current saving
increases. Thus the substitution effect implies that current saving increases in
response to an increase in the real interest rate.
The income effect of the real interest rate on saving reﬂects the change in cur-
rent consumption that results when a higher real interest rate makes a consumer
richer or poorer. For example, if Prudence has a savings account and has not bor-
rowed any funds, she is a recipient of interest payments. She therefore beneﬁts from
an increase in the real interest rate because her interest income increases. With a
higher interest rate, she can afford to have the same levels of current and future
consumption as before the interest rate change, and she would have some addi-
tional resources to spend. These extra resources are effectively the same as an
increase in her wealth, so she will increase both her current and her future con-
sumption. Thus, for a saver, who is a recipient of interest payments, the income
effect of an increase in the real interest rate is to increase current consumption and
reduce current saving. Therefore, for a saver, the income and substitution effects of
an increase in the real interest rate work in opposite directions, with the income
effect reducing saving and the substitution effect increasing saving.
The income effect of an increase in the real interest rate is different for a payer
of interest, such as a borrower. An increase in the real interest rate increases the
amount of interest payments that a borrower must make, thereby making the
borrower unable to afford the same levels of current and future consumption as
before the increase in the real interest rate. The borrower has effectively suffered
a loss of wealth as a result of the increase in the real interest rate, and responds to
this decline in wealth by reducing both current consumption and future con-
sumption. The reduction in current consumption means that current saving
increases (that is, borrowing decreases). Hence, for a borrower, the income effect
of an increase in the real interest rate is to increase saving. Thus both the substi-
tution effect and the income effect of an increase in the real interest rate increase
the saving of a borrower.
Let’s summarize the effect of an increase in the real interest rate. For a saver, who
is a recipient of interest, an increase in the real interest rate tends to increase saving
through the substitution effect but to reduce saving through the income effect. With-
out additional information, we cannot say which of these two opposing effects is
larger. For a borrower, who is a payer of interest, both the substitution effect and the
income effect operate to increase saving. Consequently, the saving of a borrower
unambiguously increases.
What is the effect of an increase in the real interest rate on national saving?
Because the national economy is composed of both borrowers and savers, and
because, in principle, savers could either increase or decrease their saving in
response to an increase in the real interest rate, economic theory cannot answer this
question. As economic theory does not indicate whether national saving increases
or decreases in response to an increase in the real interest rate, we must rely on
empirical studies that examine this relationship using actual data. Unfortunately,
interpretation of the empirical evidence from the many studies done continues to
inspire debate. The most widely accepted conclusion seems to be that an increase
in the real interest rate reduces current consumption and increases saving, but this
effect isn’t very strong.

Taxes and the Real Return to Saving. In discussing the real return that savers
earn, we have not yet mentioned an important practical consideration: Interest
earnings (and other returns on savings) are taxed. Because part of interest
earnings must be paid as taxes, the real return earned by savers is actually less
than the difference between the nominal interest rate and expected inﬂation.
A useful measure of the returns received by savers that recognizes the effects of
taxes is the expected after-tax real interest rate. To deﬁne this concept, we let repre-
sent the nominal interest rate and the rate at which interest income is taxed. In the
United States, for example, most interest earnings are taxed as ordinary income, so
is the income tax rate. Savers retain a fraction of total interest earned so
that the after-tax nominal interest rate, received by savers after payment of taxes, is
. The expected after-tax real interest rate, , is the after-tax nominal
interest rate minus the expected inﬂation rate, , or
(4.2)
The expected after-tax real interest rate is the appropriate interest rate for con-
sumers to use in making consumption and saving decisions because it measures
the increase in the purchasing power of their saving after payment of taxes.
Table 4.1 shows how to calculate the after-tax nominal interest rate and the
expected after-tax real interest rate. Note that, given the nominal interest rate and
expected inﬂation, a reduction in the tax rate on interest income increases the nom-
inal and real after-tax rates of return that a saver receives. Thus, by reducing the
rate at which it taxes interest, the government can increase the real rate of return
earned by savers and (possibly) increase the rate of saving in the economy.
The stimulation of saving is the motivation for tax provisions such as individ-
ual retirement accounts (IRAs), which allow savers to shelter part of their interest
earnings from taxes and thus earn higher after-tax rates of return. Unfortunately,
because economists disagree about the effect of higher real interest rates on saving,
the effectiveness of IRAs and similar tax breaks for saving also is in dispute.
Fiscal Policy
We’ve just demonstrated how government tax policies can affect the real return
earned by savers and thus, perhaps, the saving rate. However, even when govern-
ment ﬁscal policies—decisions about spending and taxes—aren’t intentionally

Interest Rates
Although in our theoretical discussions we refer to “the” interest rate, as if there
were only one, actually there are many different interest rates, each of which
depends on the identity of the borrower and the terms of the loan. Shown here
are some interest rates that appeared in Federal Reserve statistical release H.15 on
July 20, 2009.
The prime rate is the basic rate that banks charge on loans to their best cus-
tomers. The Federal funds rate is the rate at which banks make overnight loans to
one another. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are debts of the U.S. government, and
directed at affecting the saving rate, these policies have important implications for
the amount of consumption and saving that takes place in the economy. Although
understanding the links between ﬁscal policy and consumer behavior requires some
difﬁcult economic reasoning, these links are so important that we introduce them
here. Later we discuss several of these issues further, particularly in Chapter 15.
To make the discussion of ﬁscal policy effects as straightforward as possible,
we take the economy’s aggregate output, , as a given. That is, we ignore the pos-
sibility that the changes in ﬁscal policy that we consider could affect the aggregate
supply of goods and services. This assumption is valid if the economy is at full
employment (as we are assuming throughout Part 2 of this book) and if the ﬁscal
policy changes don’t signiﬁcantly affect the capital stock or employment. Later
we relax the ﬁxed-output assumption and discuss both the classical and Keynesian
views about how ﬁscal policy changes can affect output.
In general, ﬁscal policy affects desired consumption, , primarily by affecting
households’ current and expected future incomes. More speciﬁcally, ﬁscal changes
that increase the tax burden on the private sector, either by raising current taxes or
by leading people to expect that taxes will be higher in the future, will cause people
to consume less.
For a given level of output, , government ﬁscal policies affect desired national
saving, , or , in two basic ways. First, as we just noted, ﬁscal policy
can inﬂuence desired consumption: For any levels of output, , and government
purchases, , a ﬁscal policy change that reduces desired consumption, , by one
dollar will at the same time raise desired national saving, , by one dollar. Second,
for any levels of output and desired consumption, increases in government pur-
chases directly lower desired national saving, as is apparent from the deﬁnition of
desired national saving, . S

municipal bonds are obligations of state and local governments. With the
exception of the prime rate, these interest rates vary continuously as ﬁnancial
market conditions change. The prime rate is an average of lending rates set by
major banks and changes less frequently.
The interest rates charged on these different types of loans need not be the
same. One reason for this variation is differences in the risk of nonrepayment,
or default. Federal government debt is believed to be free from default risk,
but there is always a chance that a business, bank, or municipality may not be
able to repay what it borrowed. Lenders charge risky borrowers extra interest
to compensate themselves for the risk of default. Thus the prime rate, the
Federal funds rate, and the municipal bond rate are higher than they would be
if there were no default risk.
A second factor affecting interest rates is the length of time for which
the funds are borrowed. The relationship between the life of a bond (its
maturity) and the interest rate it pays is called the yield curve. The accom-
panying figure shows the yield curve in July 2009 and the yield curve one
year earlier. Because longer maturity bonds typically pay higher interest
rates than shorter maturity bonds, the yield curve generally slopes upward.
We will discuss how interest rates relate to the maturity of a bond in the sec-
tion “Time to Maturity” in Chapter 7, pp. 245–246.

A ﬁnal factor affecting interest rates is tax status. Because interest on municipal
bonds is not taxable, lenders are willing to accept a lower interest rate on these
loans than if the interest were taxable.
Although the levels of the various interest rates are quite different, interest rates
go up and down together most of the time. All of the interest rates discussed here,
including those on Treasury bills, notes, and bonds of various maturities and on
municipal bonds, decreased between July 2008 and July 2009. As a general rule,
interest rates tend to move together, so in our economic analyses we usually refer to
“the” interest rate, as if there were only one.

116 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
To illustrate these general points, we consider how desired consumption and
desired national saving would be affected by two speciﬁc ﬁscal policy changes: an
increase in government purchases and a tax cut.
Government Purchases. Suppose that current government purchases, , increase
by $10 billion, perhaps because the government increases military spending.
Assume that this increase in is temporary so that plans for future government
purchases are unchanged. (Analytical Problem 5 at the end of this chapter looks at
the case of a permanent increase in government purchases.) For any ﬁxed level of
output, , how will this change in ﬁscal policy affect desired consumption and
desired national saving in the economy?
Let’s start by ﬁnding the effect of the increased government purchases on con-
sumption. As already mentioned, changes in government purchases affect con-
sumption because they affect private-sector tax burdens. Suppose for example that
the government pays for the extra $10 billion in military spending by raising cur-
rent taxes by $10 billion. For a given total (before-tax) output, , this tax increase
implies a $10 billion decline in consumers’ current (after-tax) incomes. We know
that consumers respond to a decline in their current incomes by reducing con-
sumption, although by less than the decline in current income.
4
So, in response to
the $10 billion tax increase, consumers might, for example, reduce their current con-
sumption by $6 billion.
What happens to consumption if the government doesn’t raise current taxes
when it increases its purchases? The analysis in this case is more subtle. If the gov-
ernment doesn’t raise current taxes, it will have to borrow the $10 billion to pay for
the extra spending. The government will have to repay the $10 billion it borrows,
plus interest, sometime in the future, implying that future taxes will have to rise. If
taxpayers are clever enough to understand that increased government purchases
today mean higher taxes in the future, households’ expected future (after-tax)
incomes will fall, and again they will reduce desired consumption. For the sake of
illustration, we can imagine that they again reduce their current consumption by
$6 billion, although the reduction in consumption might be less if some consumers
don’t understand that their future taxes are likely to rise.
What about the effects on desired national saving? The increase in govern-
ment purchases affects desired national saving, , directly by increasing
and indirectly by reducing desired consumption, . In our example, the increase
in government purchases reduces desired consumption by $6 billion, which by
itself would raise national saving by $6 billion. However, this effect is outweighed
by the increase in of $10 billion so that overall desired national saving,
, falls by $4 billion, with output, , held constant.
5
More generally,
because the decline in desired consumption can be expected to be less than the
initial increase in government purchases, a temporary increase in government pur-
chases will lower desired national saving.
To summarize, for a given current level of output, , we conclude that a tem-
porary increase in government purchases reduces both desired consumption and
desired national saving.

Recall that the marginal propensity to consume out of current income is positive but less than 1.

Note that national saving would fall by even more than $4 billion if consumers ignored the prospect
of future tax increases and thus didn’t reduce their current consumption.
M04_ABEL4529_07_SE_C04.QXD  12/11/09  1:41 AM  Page 116
Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment 117
Taxes. Now suppose that government purchases, , remain constant but that
the government reduces current taxes, , by $10 billion. To keep things as simple
as possible, we suppose that the tax cut is a lump sum, giving each taxpayer the
same amount (think of the country’s 100 million taxpayers receiving $100 each).
With government purchases, , and output, , held constant, desired national
saving, , will change only if desired consumption, , changes. So the
question is, How will desired consumption respond to the cut in current taxes?
Again the key issue is, How does the tax cut affect people’s current and expect-
ed future incomes? The $10 billion current tax cut directly increases current (after-
tax) incomes by $10 billion, so the tax cut should increase desired consumption (by
somewhat less than $10 billion). However, the $10 billion current tax cut also
should lead people to expect lower after-tax incomes in the future. The reason is
that, because the government hasn’t changed its spending, to cut taxes by $10 billion
today the government must also increase its current borrowing by $10 billion.
Because the extra $10 billion of government debt will have to be repaid with inter-
est in the future, future taxes will have to be higher, which in turn implies lower
future disposable incomes for households. All else being equal, the decline in
expected future incomes will cause people to consume less today, offsetting the
positive effect of increased current income on desired consumption. Thus, in prin-
ciple, a current tax cut—which raises current incomes but lowers expected future
incomes—could either raise or lower current desired consumption.
Interestingly, some economists argue that the positive effect of increased cur-
rent income and the negative effect of decreased future income on desired con-
sumption should exactly cancel so that the overall effect of a current tax cut on
consumption is zero! The idea that tax cuts do not affect desired consumption and
(therefore) also do not affect desired national saving,
6
is called the Ricardian equiv-
alence proposition.
7
The Ricardian equivalence idea can be brieﬂy explained as follows (see Chapter
15 for a more detailed discussion). In the long run, all government purchases must
be paid for by taxes. Thus, if the government’s current and planned purchases do
not change, a cut in current taxes can affect the timing of tax collections but (advo-
cates of Ricardian equivalence emphasize) not the ultimate tax burden borne by
consumers. A current tax cut with no change in government purchases doesn’t
really make consumers any better off (any reduction in taxes today is balanced by
tax increases in the future), so they have no reason to respond to the tax cut by
changing their desired consumption.
Although the logic of the Ricardian equivalence proposition is sound, many
economists question whether it makes sense in practice. Most of these skeptics
argue that, even though the proposition predicts that consumers will not increase
consumption when taxes are cut, in reality lower current taxes likely will lead to
increased desired consumption and thus reduced desired national saving. One

In this example, private disposable income rises by $10 billion, so if desired consumption doesn’t
change, desired private saving rises by $10 billion. However, the government deﬁcit also rises by 
$10 billion because of the tax cut, so government saving falls by $10 billion. Therefore desired nation-
al saving—private saving plus government saving—doesn’t change.
7
The argument was ﬁrst advanced by the nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo, although he
expressed some reservations about its applicability to real-world situations. The word “equivalence”
refers to the idea that, if Ricardian equivalence is true, taxes and government borrowing have
equivalent effects on the economy.

APPLICATION
How Consumers Respond to Tax Rebates
In 2008, during the recession that began in December 2007, the government gave
consumers a tax rebate, hoping to stimulate the economy. But if Ricardian equiva-
lence holds, such a tax rebate is not likely to be effective at stimulating consumer
spending or the economy.
Some evidence suggesting that consumer spending would not rise much in
response to a tax rebate was provided by Matthew D. Shapiro and Joel Slemrod of
the University of Michigan in a study of the tax rebate given to consumers in the

reason that consumption may rise after a tax cut is that many—perhaps most—con-
sumers do not understand that increased government borrowing today is likely to
lead to higher taxes in the future. Thus consumers may simply respond to the cur-
rent tax cut, as they would to any other increase in current income, by increasing
their desired consumption.
The effects of a tax cut on consumption and saving may be summarized as fol-
lows: According to the Ricardian equivalence proposition, with no change in cur-
rent or planned government purchases, a tax cut doesn’t change desired
consumption and desired national saving. However, the Ricardian equivalence
proposition may not apply if consumers fail to take account of possible future tax
increases in their planning; in that case, a tax cut will increase desired consumption
and reduce desired national saving.
The factors that affect consumption and saving are listed in Summary table 5.

2001 recession.
8
They found that fewer than one-quarter of households said they
mostly spent the tax rebates they received in 2001. This ﬁnding indicates that the
tax rebates did not stimulate the economy as much as the government had hoped
when it passed the tax cuts into law.
New evidence on the impact of the tax rebates in 2001 has been developed
recently by Sumit Agarwal of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chunlin Liu of
the University of Nevada, and Nicholas Souleles of the University of Pennsylva-
nia.
9
They found evidence consistent with the results in the study by Shapiro and
Slemrod, which is that most consumers saved most of the rebate they received, at
least initially. But, using a novel data set of credit-card purchases and balances by
about 75,000 households from a large credit-card issuer, they found that in the
months after the rebate was received, a typical household gradually increased its
purchases and increased its credit-card debt.
Agarwal, Liu, and Souleles ﬁrst examined the pattern of how credit-card pay-
ments changed after the rebate is received by a household. Then they looked to see
if credit-card purchases subsequently rose. Finally, they were able to examine the
change in the amount of credit-card debt the household had. Since the rebate
checks were mailed out over a three-month period depending on the social securi-
ty numbers of taxpayers, Agarwal, Liu, and Souleles were able to calculate exactly
when each household received its rebate check. This information enabled them to
determine the response of payments, purchases, and credit-card debt.
One clear impact of the tax rebates in 2001 was to spur people to increase pay-
ments to their credit-card issuers. Though many people at ﬁrst made additional pay-
ments on their credit cards, they also changed their purchasing behavior in response
to the tax rebate. At ﬁrst, households did not increase their credit-card purchases. But
after a few months, they began to increase their purchases and after nine months had
spent an additional $60 on average on their credit cards because of the tax rebate.
Because initially purchases did not change but payments increased, the aver-
age amount of credit-card debt declined at ﬁrst. As households began to purchase
more over time, the amount of credit-card debt began to rise. Nine months after
receiving its tax rebate, the average household ended up with a little over $25 of
additional credit-card debt, which is a small increase relative to average debt levels
of about $2000 and is not statistically signiﬁcant.
Because the main results take the average across many different households, it
may be worthwhile to look at different segments of the population to see how
they responded to the tax rebates. In particular, in Appendix 4.A we discuss how
binding borrowing constraints (which prevent people from borrowing as much as
they would like) can affect consumption behavior. In particular, someone who is
unable to borrow any more because of a binding borrowing constraint (perhaps
resulting from a credit-card limit imposed by its bank) is likely to spend more of the
tax rebate than someone who is not constrained. Most likely, younger people
(whose future income tends to be higher than current income) and those with low
limits on their credit cards are likely to face binding borrowing constraints.

120 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
4.2 Investment
Let’s now turn to a second major component of spending: investment spending by
ﬁrms. Like consumption and saving decisions, the decision about how much to
invest depends largely on expectations about the economy’s future. Investment
also shares in common with saving and consumption the idea of a trade-off
between the present and the future. In making a capital investment, a ﬁrm commits
its current resources (which could otherwise be used, for example, to pay increased
dividends to shareholders) to increasing its capacity to produce and earn proﬁts in
the future.
Recall from Chapter 2 that investment refers to the purchase or construction
of capital goods, including residential and nonresidential buildings, equipment
and software used in production, and additions to inventory stocks. From a
macroeconomic perspective, there are two main reasons to study investment
behavior. First, more so than the other components of aggregate spending,
investment spending fluctuates sharply over the business cycle, falling in reces-
sions and rising in booms. Even though investment is only about one-sixth of
GDP, in the typical recession half or more of the total decline in spending is
reduced investment spending. Hence explaining the behavior of investment is
important for understanding the business cycle, which we explore further in
Part 3.
The second reason for studying investment behavior is that investment
plays a crucial role in determining the long-run productive capacity of the econ-
omy. Because investment creates new capital goods, a high rate of investment
means that the capital stock is growing quickly. As discussed in Chapter 3, cap-
ital is one of the two most important factors of production (the other is labor). All
else being equal, output will be higher in an economy that has invested rapidly
and thus built up a large capital stock than in an economy that hasn’t acquired
much capital.
To see if young people responded more to the tax rebates than others, Agarwal,
Liu, and Souleles split their data into three age groups: young people (less than
35 years old), middle-aged people, and old people (over 60 years old). They found
that nine months after receiving the tax rebate, young people had increased their
purchases by about $200, which was substantially more than the other groups.
Also, debt increased by about $130 for young households but by much less for
older households.
Agarwal, Liu, and Souleles performed a similar split based on the credit-card
limits faced by the household. People in the low-credit-limit group have limits of
less than $7,500, while people in the high-limit group have limits exceeding $10,500.
The results indicate that people with high credit limits paid off more of their bal-
ances, spent less, and reduced their credit-card debt more than the other groups.
Thus, it appears that people with high credit limits, who may be less likely to face
binding borrowing constraints, mainly responded to the tax rebates closer to the
manner suggested by the Ricardian equivalence theory, while those facing binding
borrowing constraints did not. We might expect a similar response to the 2008 tax
rebates, but will have wait until new data become available to know.

Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment 121
The Desired Capital Stock
To understand what determines the amount of investment, we must consider
how firms decide how much capital they want. If firms attempt to maximize
proﬁt, as we assume, a ﬁrm’s desired capital stock is the amount of capital that
allows the ﬁrm to earn the largest expected proﬁt. Managers can determine the
proﬁt- maximizing level of the capital stock by comparing the costs and beneﬁts of
using additional capital—a new machine, for example. If the beneﬁts outweigh the
costs, expanding the capital stock will raise proﬁts. But if the costs outweigh the
beneﬁts, the ﬁrm shouldn’t increase its planned capital stock and may even want
to reduce it. As you might infer from this brief description, the economic logic
underlying a ﬁrm’s decision about how much capital to use is similar to the logic
of its decision about how many workers to employ, discussed in Chapter 3.
In real terms, the beneﬁt to a ﬁrm of having an additional unit of capital is the
marginal product of capital, MPK. Recall from Chapter 3 that the MPK is the
increase in output that a ﬁrm can obtain by adding a unit of capital, holding con-
stant the ﬁrm’s work force and other factors of production. Because lags occur in
obtaining and installing new capital, the expected future marginal product of cap-
ital, , is the beneﬁt from increasing investment today by one unit of capital.
This expected future beneﬁt must be compared to the expected cost of using that
extra unit of capital, or the user cost of capital.
The User Cost of Capital. To make the discussion of the user cost of capital more
concrete, let’s consider the case of Kyle’s Bakery, Inc., a company that produces
specialty cookies. Kyle, the bakery’s owner-manager, is considering investing in a
new solar-powered oven that will allow him to produce more cookies in the
future. If he decides to buy such an oven, he must also determine its size. In
making this decision, Kyle has the following information:
1. A new oven can be purchased in any size at a price of $100 per cubic foot,
measured in real (base-year) dollars.
2. Because the oven is solar powered, using it does not involve energy costs. The
oven also does not require maintenance expenditures.
10
However, the oven
becomes less efﬁcient as it ages: With each year that passes, the oven produces
10% fewer cookies. Because of this depreciation, the real value of an oven falls
10% per year. For example, after one year of use, the real value of the oven is
$90 per cubic foot.
3. Kyle can borrow (from a bank) or lend (to the government, by buying a one-year
government bond) at the prevailing expected real interest rate of 8% per year.
In calculating the user cost of capital, we use the following symbols (the
numerical values are from the example of Kyle’s Bakery):
r = expected real interest rate (8% per year).
d = rate at which capital depreciates (10% per year);
p
K 
= real price of capital goods ($100 per cubic foot);
MPK
f
10
These assumptions simplify the example. If there were operating costs, such as fuel and mainte-
nance costs, we would subtract them from the expected future marginal product of capital when
calculating the beneﬁt of using the oven.

122 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
The user cost of capital is the expected real cost of using a unit of capital for
a speciﬁed period of time. For Kyle’s Bakery, we consider the expected costs of
purchasing a new oven, using it for a year, and then selling it. The cost of using the
oven has two components: depreciation and interest.
In general, the depreciation cost of using capital is the value lost as the cap-
ital wears out. Because of depreciation, after one year the oven for which Kyle
pays $100 per cubic foot when new will be worth only $90 per cubic foot. The
$10-per-cubic-foot loss that Kyle suffers over the year is the depreciation cost of
using the oven. Even if Kyle doesn’t sell the oven at the end of a year, he suffers
this loss because at the end of the year the asset’s (the oven’s) economic value
will be 10% less.
The interest cost of using capital equals the expected real interest rate times
the price of the capital. As the expected real interest rate is 8%, Kyle’s interest cost
of using the oven for a year is 8% of $100 per cubic foot, or $8 per cubic foot. To
see why the interest cost is a cost of using capital, imagine ﬁrst that Kyle must
borrow the funds necessary to buy the oven; in this case, the interest cost of $8 per
cubic foot is the interest he pays on the loan, which is obviously part of the total
cost of using the oven. Alternatively, if Kyle uses proﬁts from the business to buy
the oven, he gives up the opportunity to use those funds to buy an interest-bear-
ing asset, such as a government bond. For every $100 that Kyle puts into the
oven, he is sacriﬁcing $8 in interest that he would have earned by purchasing a
$100 government bond. This forgone interest is a cost to Kyle of using the oven.
Thus the interest cost is part of the true economic cost of using capital, whether
the capital’s purchase is ﬁnanced with borrowed funds or with the ﬁrm’s own
retained proﬁts.
The user cost of capital is the sum of the depreciation cost and the interest
cost. The interest cost is , the depreciation cost is , and the user cost of
capital, , is
(4.3)
In the case of Kyle’s Bakery,
Thus Kyle’s user cost of capital is $18 per cubic foot per year.
Determining the Desired Capital Stock. Now we can ﬁnd a ﬁrm’s proﬁt-
maximizing capital stock, or desired capital stock. A ﬁrm’s desired capital stock is
the capital stock at which the expected future marginal product of capital equals
the user cost of capital.
Figure 4.3 shows the determination of the desired capital stock for Kyle’s
Bakery. The capital stock, , expressed as cubic feet of oven capacity, is measured
along the horizontal axis. Both the and the user cost of capital are measured
along the vertical axis.
The downward-sloping curve shows the value of the for different sizes
of the capital stock, ; at each level of , the equals the expected real value of
the extra cookies that could be produced per year if oven capacity were expanded
an additional cubic foot. The curve slopes downward because the marginal
product of capital falls as the capital stock is increased (we discussed reasons for the

diminishing marginal productivity of capital in Chapter 3). The user cost (equal to
$18 per cubic foot per year in the example) doesn’t depend on the amount of cap-
ital and is represented by a horizontal line.
The amount of capital that maximizes the expected profit of Kyle’s Bakery is
5000 cubic feet, represented by point in Fig. 4.3. At , the expected benefit of
an additional unit of capital, , equals the user cost, . For any amount of
oven capacity less than 5000 cubic feet, Kyle’s Bakery could increase its expected
profit by increasing oven capacity. For example, Fig. 4.3 shows that at a planned
capacity of 4000 cubic feet the of an additional cubic foot is $20 worth of
cookies per year, which exceeds the $18 per year expected cost of using the
additional cubic foot of capacity. Starting from a planned capacity of 4000 cubic
feet, if Kyle adds an extra cubic foot of capacity , he will gain an additional $20 worth
of future output per year while incurring only $18 per year in expected future
costs. Thus expanding beyond 4000 cubic feet is profitable for Kyle. Similarly,
Fig. 4.3 shows that at an oven capacity of more than 5000 cubic feet the expect-
ed future marginal product of capital, , is less than the user cost, ; in this
case Kyle’s Bakery could increase expected profit by reducing its capital stock.
Only when will the capital stock be at the level that maximizes
expected profit.
As mentioned earlier, the determination of the desired capital stock is similar
to the determination of the ﬁrm’s labor demand, described in Chapter 3. Recall that
the ﬁrm’s proﬁt-maximizing level of employment is the level at which the marginal
product of labor equals the wage. Analogously, the firm’s profit-maximizing
level of capital is the level at which the expected future marginal product of capi-
tal equals the user cost, which can be thought of as the “wage” of capital (the cost
of using capital for one period).

124 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Changes in the Desired Capital Stock
Any factor that shifts the curve or changes the user cost of capital changes the
ﬁrm’s desired capital stock. For Kyle’s Bakery, suppose that the real interest rate
falls from 8% per year to 6% per year. If the real interest rate, , is 0.06 per year and
the depreciation rate, , and the price of capital, , remain at 0.10 per year and $100
per cubic foot, respectively, the decline in the real interest rate reduces the user cost
of capital, , from $18 per cubic foot per year to $100 per cubic
foot per year, or $16 per cubic foot per year.
This decline in the user cost is shown as a downward shift of the user cost line,
from to in Fig. 4.4. After that shift, the at the original desired capital
stock of 5000 cubic feet (point ), or $18 per cubic foot per year, exceeds the user
cost of capital, now $16 per cubic foot per year (point ). Kyle’s Bakery can increase
its proﬁt by raising planned oven capacity to 6000 cubic feet, where the 
equals the user cost of $16 per cubic foot per year (point ). This example illustrates
that a decrease in the expected real interest rate—or any other change that lowers
the user cost of capital—increases the desired capital stock.
Technological changes that affect the curve also affect the desired stock of
capital. Suppose that Kyle invents a new type of cookie dough that requires less
baking time, allowing 12.5% more cookies to be baked daily. Such a technological
advance would cause the curve for ovens to shift upward by 12.5% at each
value of the capital stock. Figure 4.5 shows this effect as a shift of the curve from
to . If the user cost remains at $18 per cubic foot per year, the techno-
logical advance causes Kyle’s desired capital stock to rise from 5000 to 6000 cubic feet.
At 6000 cubic feet (point ) the again equals the user cost of capital. In general,
with the user cost of capital held constant, an increase in the expected future marginal
product of capital at any level of capital raises the desired capital stock.

Taxes and the Desired Capital Stock. So far we have ignored the role of taxes in
the investment decision. But Kyle is interested in maximizing the proﬁt his ﬁrm
gets to keep after paying taxes. Thus he must take into account taxes in evaluating
the desirability of an additional unit of capital.
Suppose that Kyle’s Bakery pays 20% of its revenues in taxes. In this case,
extra oven capacity that increases the ﬁrm’s future revenues by, say, $20 will raise
Kyle’s after-tax revenue by only $16, with $4 going to the government. To decide
whether to add this extra capacity, Kyle should compare the after-tax of $16
per cubic foot per year—not the before-tax of $20 per cubic foot per year—
with the user cost. In general, if is the tax rate on ﬁrm revenues, the after-tax
future marginal product of capital is . The desired capital stock is the
one for which the after-tax future marginal product equals the user cost, or
Dividing both sides of this equation by , we obtain
(4.4)
In Eq. (4.4), the term is called the tax-adjusted user cost of capital.
The tax-adjusted user cost of capital shows how large the before-tax future mar-
ginal product of capital must be for a ﬁrm to willingly add another unit of capital.
An increase in the tax rate raises the tax-adjusted user cost and thus reduces the
desired stock of capital.
To derive the tax-adjusted user cost, we assumed that taxes are levied as a pro-
portion of ﬁrms’ revenues. However, actual corporate taxes in the United States
and other countries are much more complicated. Firms generally pay taxes on

their proﬁts rather than on their revenues, and the part of proﬁt that is considered
taxable may depend on how much the ﬁrm invests. For example, when a ﬁrm
purchases some capital, it is allowed to deduct part of the purchase price of the cap-
ital from its taxable proﬁt in both the year of purchase and in subsequent years. By
reducing the amount of proﬁt to be taxed, these deductions, known as depreciation
allowances, allow the ﬁrm to reduce its total tax payment.
Another important tax provision, which has been used at various times in the
United States, is the investment tax credit. An investment tax credit permits the ﬁrm
to subtract a percentage of the purchase price of new capital directly from its tax
bill. So, for example, if the investment tax credit is 10%, a ﬁrm that purchases a
$15,000 piece of equipment can reduce its taxes by $1500 (10% of $15,000) in the
year the equipment is purchased.
Economists summarize the many provisions of the tax code affecting investment
by a single measure of the tax burden on capital called the effective tax rate. Essen-
tially , the idea is to ask: What tax rate on a ﬁrm’s revenue would have the same effect
on the desired capital stock as do the actual provisions of the tax code? The hypo-
thetical tax rate that answers this question is the effective tax rate. Changes in the tax
law that, for example, raise the effective tax rate are equivalent to an increased tax on
ﬁrm revenue and a rise in the tax-adjusted user cost of capital. Thus, all else being
equal, an increase in the effective tax rate lowers the desired capital stock.
Table 4.2 shows effective tax rates on capital for countries in the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2007. The effective tax
rate on capital ranges from -3.4% in Belgium to 37.1% in Korea. Also shown are the
ratios of gross investment to GDP in each of these countries. Because an increase in
the effective tax rate on capital increases the tax-adjusted user cost of capital, we
would expect countries with high effective tax rates on capital to have low rates of

APPLICATION
Measuring the Effects of Taxes on Investment
Does the effective tax rate signiﬁcantly affect investment patterns? Determining the
empirical relationship between tax rates and investment isn’t easy. One problem is
that the factors other than taxes that affect the desired capital stock—such as the
expected future marginal product of capital and real interest rates—are always
changing, making it difﬁcult to isolate the “pure” effects of tax changes. Another
problem is that changes in the tax code don’t happen randomly but reﬂect the
government’s assessment of economic conditions. For example, Congress is likely
to reduce taxes on investment when investment spending is expected to be unusu-
ally low so as to boost spending. But if Congress does so, low taxes on capital will
tend to be associated with periods of low investment, and an econometrician might
mistakenly conclude that tax cuts reduce rather than increase investment spending.
For example, Congress passed an economic stimulus plan in early 2002 designed to
increase investment by allowing ﬁrms to depreciate capital for tax purposes faster
than the true depreciation on the capital, effectively reducing the tax rate on the
capital. But gross private domestic investment had already declined from 18% of
GDP in 2000 to 16% in 2001, and it fell to 15% in 2002 despite the tax cut. More
recently, the stimulus package passed by Congress in early 2009 provided an $8000
tax credit for qualiﬁed ﬁrst-time homebuyers, which reduces the tax-adjusted user
cost of housing for recipients of the credit, and was intended to stimulate residen-
tial investment. But by the ﬁrst quarter of 2009 residential investment had fallen to
2.7% of GDP from 5.0% of GDP in the ﬁrst quarter of 2007, and 3.7% of GDP in the
ﬁrst quarter of 2008, and, as of this writing, residential investment for 2009 was for-
cast to remain low.
An interesting study that attempted to solve both of these problems was car-
ried out by Jason Cummins and R. Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University and
Kevin Hassett of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
11
To get
around the problem that factors other than taxes are always changing, Cummins,
Hubbard, and Hassett focused on the periods around thirteen major tax reforms,
beginning with the investment tax credit initiated by President Kennedy in 1962
and ending with the major tax reform of 1986, passed under President Reagan. The
authors’ idea was that, by looking at occasions when the tax code changed signif-
icantly in a short period of time, they could reasonably assume that most of the
ensuing change in investment was the result of the tax change rather than other fac-
tors. To get around the second problem, that tax cuts tend to take place when
aggregate investment is low, Cummins, Hubbard, and Hassett didn’t look at the
behavior of aggregate investment; instead, they compared the investment responses
of a large number of individual corporations to each tax reform. Because the tax
laws treat different types of capital differently (for example, a machine and a fac-
tory are taxed differently) and because companies use capital in different combi-
nations, the authors argued that observing how different companies changed their

investment, all else being equal. However, all else is not equal in the various coun-
tries in Table 4.2, and, in fact, there is little statistical relationship between the effec-
tive tax rate and investment in this group of countries. In the following application,
we describe a successful approach to measuring the impact of taxes on investment.
From the Desired Capital Stock to Investment
Now let’s look at the link between a ﬁrm’s desired capital stock and the amount it
invests. In general, the capital stock (of a ﬁrm or of a country) changes over time
through two opposing channels. First, the purchase or construction of new capital
goods increases the capital stock. We’ve been calling the total purchase or con-
struction of new capital goods that takes place each year “investment,” but its pre-
cise name is gross investment. Second, the capital stock depreciates or wears out,
which reduces the capital stock.
Whether the capital stock increases or decreases over the course of a year
depends on whether gross investment is greater or less than depreciation during
the year; when gross investment exceeds depreciation, the capital stock grows.
The change in the capital stock over the year—or, equivalently, the difference
between gross investment and depreciation—is net investment.
We express these concepts symbolically as
Net investment, the change in the capital stock during period , equals .
The amount of depreciation during year is , where is the fraction of capital
that depreciates each year. The relationship between net and gross investment is
(4.5)
In most but not all years, gross investment is larger than depreciation so that
net investment is positive and the capital stock increases. Figure 4.6 shows the

investment after each tax reform would provide information on the effects of the
tax changes. For example, if a tax reform cuts taxes on machines relative to taxes on
factories and taxes are an important determinant of investment, companies whose
investment is concentrated in machinery should respond relatively more strongly
to the tax change than companies who invest primarily in factories.
Cummins, Hubbard, and Hassett found considerably stronger effects of tax
changes on investment than reported in previous studies, possibly because the
earlier studies didn’t deal effectively with the two problems that we identiﬁed.
These authors found an empirical elasticity of about . That is, according to
their estimates, a tax change that lowers the user cost of capital by 10% would raise
aggregate investment by about 6.6%, a signiﬁcant amount. Most previous studies
had found this elasticity to be about . Thus, more recent research shows that
the effective tax rate signiﬁcantly affects investment.

behavior since 1929 of gross and net investment in the United States, expressed as
percentages of GDP; the difference between gross and net investment is deprecia-
tion. Note the occasional large swings in both gross and net investment and the
negative rates of net investment that occurred in some years during the Great
Depression of the 1930s and World War II (1941–1945).
We use Eq. (4.5) to illustrate the relationship between the desired capital stock
and investment. First, rewriting Eq. (4.5) gives
which states that gross investment equals net investment plus depreciation.
12
Now suppose that ﬁrms use information available at the beginning of year 
about the expected future marginal product of capital and the user cost of capital
and determine the desired capital stock, , they want by the end of year (the
beginning of year ). For the moment, suppose also that capital is easily
obtainable so that ﬁrms can match the actual capital stock at the end of year , ,
with the desired capital stock, . Substituting for in the preceding equa-
tion yields
(4.6)
Equation (4.6) shows that ﬁrms’ gross investment, , during a year has two
parts: (1) the desired net increase in the capital stock over the year, ; and
(2) the investment needed to replace worn-out or depreciated capital, . The amount dK

of depreciation that occurs during a year is determined by the depreciation rate and
the initial capital stock. However, the desired net increase in the capital stock over
the year depends on the factors—such as taxes, interest rates, and the expected
future marginal product of capital—that affect the desired capital stock. Indeed,
Eq. (4.6) shows that any factor that leads to a change in the desired capital stock, ,
results in an equal change in gross investment, . 
Lags and Investment. The assumption just made—that ﬁrms can obtain capital
quickly enough to match actual capital stocks with desired levels each year—isn’t
realistic in all cases. Although most types of equipment are readily available, a
skyscraper or a nuclear power plant may take years to construct. Thus, in
practice, a $1 million increase in a ﬁrm’s desired capital stock may not translate
into a $1 million increase in gross investment within the year; instead, the extra
investment may be spread over several years as planning and construction
proceed. Despite this qualiﬁcation, factors that increase ﬁrms’ desired capital
stocks also tend to increase the current rate of investment. Summary table 6 brings
together the factors that affect investment. In “In Touch with Data and Research:
Investment and the Stock Market,” p. 131, we discuss an alternative approach to
investment, which relates investment to stock prices.
Investment in Inventories and Housing
Our discussion so far has emphasized what is called business ﬁxed investment, or
investment by ﬁrms in structures (such as factories and ofﬁce buildings), equip-
ment (such as drill presses and jetliners), and software. However, there are two
other components of investment spending: inventory investment and residential
investment. As discussed in Chapter 2, inventory investment equals the increase in
ﬁrms’ inventories of unsold goods, unﬁnished goods, or raw materials. Residential
investment is the construction of housing, such as single-family homes, condo-
miniums, or apartment buildings.
Fortunately, the concepts of future marginal product and the user cost of cap-
ital, which we used to examine business ﬁxed investment, apply equally well to
inventory investment and residential investment. Consider, for example, a new-car
dealer trying to decide whether to increase the number of cars she normally keeps
on her lot from 100 to 150—that is, whether to make an inventory investment of
50 cars. The beneﬁt of having more cars to show is that potential car buyers will
have a greater variety of models from which to select and may not have to wait for
delivery, enabling the car dealer to sell more cars. The increase in sales commissions
the car dealer expects to make, measured in real terms and with the same sales

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Investment and the Stock Market
Fluctuations in the stock market can have important macroeconomic effects.
Changes in stock prices may cause households to change how much they con-
sume and save (see the Application, “Macroeconomic Consequences of the
Boom and Bust in Stock Prices,” p. 138). Similarly, economic theory suggests
that rises and falls in the stock market should lead firms to change their rates
of capital investment in the same direction. The relationship between stock
prices and firms’ investment in physical capital is captured by the “ theory of
investment,” developed by James Tobin, who was a Nobel laureate at Yale
University.
Tobin argued that the rate of investment in any particular type of capital
can be predicted by looking at the ratio of the capital’s market value to its
replacement cost. When this ratio, often called “Tobin’s ,” is greater than 1, it
is profitable to acquire additional capital because the value of capital exceeds
the cost of acquiring it. Similarly, when Tobin’s is smaller than 1, the value of
capital is less than the cost of acquiring it, so it is not profitable to invest in
additional capital.
Because much of the value of ﬁrms comes from the capital they own, we can
use the stock market value of a ﬁrm as a measure of the market value of the ﬁrm’s
capital stock. If we let be the stock market value of a ﬁrm, be the amount of
capital the ﬁrm owns, and be the price of new capital goods, then for an indi-
vidual ﬁrm
where is the replacement cost of the firm’s capital stock. If the replacement
cost of capital isn’t changing much, a boom in the stock market (an increase in )
will cause Tobin’s to rise for most firms, leading to increased rates of invest-
ment. Essentially, when the stock market is high, firms find it profitable to
expand.
Figure 4.7 shows quarterly data on Tobin’s q and real private nonresidential
investment. Consistent with the theory, the two are closely related; Tobin’s q and
investment rose together throughout the 1990s and then both fell sharply in 2000
and 2008. However, in speciﬁc episodes, such as the 1987 stock market crash and
the mid 2000s, Tobin’s q and investment are less closely related. In the graph,
Tobin’s q declined signiﬁcantly after the decline in stock prices in 1987 and did not
recover for a long time, but investment spending continued to grow at a fairly rapid
pace for several years.
Although it may seem different, the theory of investment is very similar to
the theory of investment discussed in this chapter. In the theory developed in
this chapter we identified three main factors affecting the desired capital stock:
the expected future marginal product of capital, ; the real interest rate, ;
and the purchase price of new capital, . Each of these factors also affects
Tobin’s q: (1) An increase in the expected marginal product of capital tends to
increase the expected future earnings of the firm, which raises the stock market
value of the firm and thus increases ; (2) a reduction in the real interest rate also q

force, is the expected future marginal product of the increased inventory. The cost
of holding more cars reﬂects (1) depreciation of the cars sitting on the lot and (2) the
interest the car dealer must pay on the loan obtained to ﬁnance the higher inventory.
The car dealer will make the inventory investment if the expected benefits of
increasing her inventory, in terms of increased sales commissions, are at least as
great as the interest and depreciation costs of adding 50 cars. This principle is the
same one that applies to business ﬁxed investment.
We can also use this same approach to analyze residential investment. The
expected future marginal product of an apartment building, for example, is the real
value of rents that can be collected from the tenants, minus taxes and operating
costs. The user cost of capital for an apartment building during a year is its depre-
ciation, or loss of value from wear and tear, plus the interest cost (reﬂected in mort-
gage payments, for example). As for other types of capital, constructing an
apartment building is proﬁtable only if its expected future marginal product is at
least as great as its user cost.

4.3 Goods Market Equilibrium
In Chapter 3, we showed that the quantity of goods and services supplied in an
economy depends on the level of productivity—as determined, for example, by the
technology used—and on the quantity of inputs, such as the capital and labor
used. In this chapter we have discussed the factors that affect the demand for
goods and services, particularly the demand for consumption goods by house-
holds and the demand for investment goods by ﬁrms. But how do we know that
the amount of goods and services that consumers and investors want to buy will be
the same as the amount that producers are willing to provide? Putting the question
another way, What economic forces bring the goods market into equilibrium, with
quantities demanded equal to quantities supplied? In this section, we show that the
real interest rate is the key economic variable whose adjustments help bring the
quantities of goods supplied and demanded into balance; thus a beneﬁt of our
analysis is an explanation of what determines interest rates. Another beneﬁt is
that, by adding the analysis of goods market equilibrium to the analysis of labor
market equilibrium in Chapter 3, we take another large step toward constructing a
complete model of the macroeconomy.
The goods market is in equilibrium when the aggregate quantity of goods sup-
plied equals the aggregate quantity of goods demanded. (For brevity, we refer
only to “goods” rather than to “goods and services,” but services always are
included.) Algebraically, this condition is
(4.7)
The left side of Eq. (4.7) is the quantity of goods, , supplied by ﬁrms, which is
determined by the factors discussed in Chapter 3. The right side of Eq. (4.7) is the
aggregate demand for goods. If we continue to assume no foreign sector, so that net
exports are zero, the quantity of goods demanded is the sum of desired consump-
tion by households, , desired investment by ﬁrms, , and government purchases,
.
13
Equation (4.7) is called the goods market equilibrium condition.
The goods market equilibrium condition is different in an important way
from the income–expenditure identity for a closed economy, (this
identity is Eq. 2.3, with ). The income–expenditure identity is a relation-
ship between actual income (output) and actual spending, which, by deﬁnition,
is always satisﬁed. In contrast, the goods market equilibrium condition does not
always have to be satisﬁed. For example, ﬁrms may produce output faster than
consumers want to buy it so that undesired inventories pile up in ﬁrms’ ware-
houses. In this situation, the income–expenditure identity is still satisfied
(because the undesired additions to ﬁrms’ inventories are counted as part of total
spending—see Chapter 2), but the goods market wouldn’t be in equilibrium
because production exceeds desired spending (which does not include the unde-
sired increases in inventories). Although in principle the goods market equilibrium
condition need not always hold, strong forces act to bring the goods market into
equilibrium fairly quickly.
A different, but equivalent, way to write the goods market equilibrium condi-
tion emphasizes the relationship between desired saving and desired investment.

To obtain this alternative form of the goods market equilibrium condition, we ﬁrst
subtract from both sides of Eq. (4.7):
The left side of this equation, , is desired national saving, (see Eq. 4.1).
Thus the goods market equilibrium condition becomes
(4.8)
This alternative way of writing the goods market equilibrium condition says that the
goods market is in equilibrium when desired national saving equals desired investment.
Because saving and investment are central to many issues we present in this
book and because the desired-saving-equals-desired-investment form of the goods
market equilibrium condition often is easier to work with, we utilize Eq. (4.8) in
most of our analyses. However, we emphasize once again that Eq. (4.8) is equivalent
to the condition that the supply of goods equals the demand for goods, Eq. (4.7).
The Saving–Investment Diagram
For the goods market to be in equilibrium, then, the aggregate supply of goods
must equal the aggregate demand for goods, or equivalently, desired national
saving must equal desired investment. We demonstrate in this section that adjust-
ments of the real interest rate allow the goods market to attain equilibrium.

vertical axis, and national saving and investment are measured along the horizon-
tal axis. The saving curve, , shows the relationship between desired national saving
and the real interest rate. The upward slope of the saving curve reﬂects the empiri-
cal ﬁnding (Section 4.1) that a higher real interest rate raises desired national saving.
The investment curve, , shows the relationship between desired investment and the
real interest rate. The investment curve slopes downward because a higher real
interest rate increases the user cost of capital and thus reduces desired investment.
Goods market equilibrium is represented by point , at which desired national
saving equals desired investment, as required by Eq. (4.8). The real interest rate cor-
responding to (6% in this example) is the only real interest rate that clears the
goods market. When the real interest rate is 6%, both desired national saving and
desired investment equal 1000.
How does the goods market come to equilibrium at , where the real interest
rate is 6%? Suppose instead that the real interest rate is 3%. As Fig. 4.8 shows,
when the real interest rate is 3%, the amount of investment that ﬁrms want to
undertake (1500) exceeds desired national saving (850). With investors wanting to
borrow more than savers want to lend, the “price” of saving—the real interest rate
that lenders receive—will be bid up. The return to savers will rise until it reaches
6%, and desired national saving and desired investment are equal. Similarly, if the
real interest rate exceeds 6%, the amount that savers want to lend will exceed what
investors want to borrow, and the real return paid to savers will be bid down.
Thus adjustments of the real interest rate, in response to an excess supply or excess
demand for saving, bring the goods market into equilibrium.
Although Fig. 4.8 shows goods market equilibrium in terms of equal saving and
investment, keep in mind that an equivalent way to express goods market equilibri-
um is that the supply of goods, , equals the demand for goods, (Eq. 4.7).
Table 4.3 illustrates this point with a numerical example consistent with the values
shown in Fig. 4.8. Here the assumption is that output, , and government purchases,
, are ﬁxed at values of 4500 and 1500, respectively. Desired consumption, , and
desired investment, , depend on the real interest rate. Desired consumption depends
on the real interest rate because a higher real interest rate raises desired saving, which
necessarily reduces desired consumption. Desired investment depends on the real
interest rate because an increase in the real interest rate raises the user cost of capital,
which lowers desired investment.
In the example in Table 4.3, when the real interest rate is 6%, desired consumption
. Therefore desired national saving 
. Also, when the real interest rate is 6%, desired investment .
As desired national saving equals desired investment when , the equilibrium
real interest rate is 6%, as in Fig. 4.8.

136 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Note, moreover, that when the real interest rate is at the equilibrium value of
6%, the aggregate supply of goods, , which is 4500, equals the aggregate demand
for goods, . Thus, both forms of the
goods market equilibrium condition, Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8), are satisﬁed when the real
interest rate equals 6%.
Table 4.3 also illustrates how adjustments of the real interest rate bring about
equilibrium in the goods market. Suppose that the real interest rate initially is 3%. Both
components of private-sector demand for goods ( and ) are higher when the real
interest rate is 3% than when it is 6%. The reason is that consumers save less and ﬁrms
invest more when real interest rates are relatively low. Thus, at a real interest of 3%, the
demand for goods is greater than the
supply of goods ( ). Equivalently , at a real interest rate of 3%, Table 4.3 shows
that desired investment exceeds desired saving . As Fig. 4.8
shows, an increase in the real interest rate to 6% eliminates the disequilibrium in the
goods market by reducing desired investment and increasing desired national saving.
An alternative explanation is that the increase in the real interest rate eliminates the
excess of the demand for goods over the supply of goods by reducing both con-
sumption demand and investment demand.
Shifts of the Saving Curve. For any real interest rate, a change in the economy
that raises desired national saving shifts the saving curve to the right, and a
change that reduces desired national saving shifts the saving curve to the left.
(Summary table 5 on p. 118 lists the factors affecting desired national saving.)
A shift of the saving curve leads to a new goods market equilibrium with a dif-
ferent real interest rate and different amounts of saving and investment. Figure 4.9

illustrates the effects of a decrease in desired national saving—resulting, for exam-
ple, from a temporary increase in current government purchases. The initial equi-
librium point is at , where (as in Fig. 4.8) the real interest rate is 6% and desired
national saving and desired investment both equal 1000. When current government
purchases increase, the resulting decrease in desired national saving causes the
saving curve to shift to the left, from to . At the new goods market equilibrium
point, , the real interest rate is 7%, reﬂecting the fact that at the initial real interest
rate of 6% the demand for funds by investors now exceeds the supply of saving.
Figure 4.9 also shows that, in response to the increase in government purchases,
national saving and investment both fall, from 1000 to 850. Saving falls because of the
initial decrease in desired saving, which is only partially offset by the increase in the
real interest rate. Investment falls because the higher real interest rate raises the user
cost of capital that ﬁrms face. When increased government purchases cause invest-
ment to decline, economists say that investment has been crowded out. The crowding
out of investment by increased government purchases occurs, in effect, because the
government is using more real resources, some of which would otherwise have gone
into investment.
Shifts of the Investment Curve. Like the saving curve, the investment curve
can shift. For any real interest rate, a change in the economy that raises desired
investment shifts the investment curve to the right, and a change that lowers
desired investment shifts the investment curve to the left. (See Summary table 6
on p. 130 for the factors affecting desired investment.)
The effects on goods market equilibrium of an increase in desired investment—
as from an invention that raises the expected future marginal product of capital—are
shown in Fig. 4.10. The increase in desired investment shifts the investment curve to

The real interest rate rises from 6% to 8% because the increased demand for invest-
ment funds causes the real interest rate to be bid up. Saving and investment also
increase, from 1000 to 1100, with the higher saving reﬂecting the willingness of
savers to save more when the real interest rate rises.
In these last two chapters, we have presented supply–demand analyses of the
labor and goods markets and developed tools needed to understand the behavior
of various macroeconomic variables, including employment, the real wage, output,
saving, investment, and the real interest rate. These concepts—and a few more
developed in the study of asset markets in Chapter 7—form the basis for the eco-
nomic analysis presented in the rest of this book. In Chapter 5, we use the concepts
developed so far to examine the determinants of trade ﬂows and international
borrowing and lending. In Chapter 6, we use them to tackle the fundamental ques-
tion of why some countries’ economies grow more quickly than others.

APPLICATION
Macroeconomic Consequences of the Boom and Bust in Stock Prices
On October 19, 1987, stock prices took their biggest-ever one-day plunge. The Stan-
dard and Poor’s index of 500 stocks dropped 20% that day, after having fallen by
16% from the market’s peak in August of the same year. About $1 trillion of ﬁnan-
cial wealth was eliminated by the decline in stock prices on that single day.
Stock prices in the United States soared during the 1990s, especially during the
second half of the decade, but then tumbled sharply early in the ﬁrst year of the
new century. Stock prices continued to fall for several years, and stockholders lost
wealth of about $5 trillion, an amount equal to about half of a year’s GDP. After
rising from 2003 to 2007, stock prices plunged during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008,
with stocks losing 48% of their value in real terms. By the ﬁrst quarter of 2009, real
stock prices were at their lowest level since 1995.
What are the macroeconomic effects of such booms and busts in stock prices?
We have emphasized two major macroeconomic channels for stock prices: a wealth
effect on consumption and an effect on capital investment through Tobin’s . Let’s
see how each of those effects worked after the stock market crash of 1987, the
increase in stock values in the 1990s, the decline in stock market wealth in the
early 2000s, and the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008.
The wealth effect on consumption arises because stocks are a component of
households’ financial assets. Because a stock market boom makes households
better off ﬁnancially, they should respond by consuming more; and likewise, a
bust in the stock market reduces household wealth and should reduce consump-
tion. To show how consumption and stock prices are related, Fig. 4.11 plots the
value of the S&P 500 index, adjusted for inﬂation, along with the ratio of con-
sumption spending to GDP .
Consumption and the 1987 Crash
We would expect that following the 1987 stock market crash, consumers would
reduce spending, but the decline in consumption should have been much smaller
than the $1 trillion decline in wealth, because consumers would spread the effects
q
M04_ABEL4529_07_SE_C04.QXD  12/11/09  1:42 AM  Page 138
Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment 139
of their losses over a long period of time by reducing planned future consumption
as well as current consumption. If consumers spread changes in their wealth over
25 years, then we might guess that current consumption spending would decline
by about $40 billion (assuming the real interest rate is near zero). However, con-
sumers might also worry that the stock market crash would lead to a recession, so
they might cut consumption further; such a scenario suggests that consumption
should decline by more than $40 billion. However, economists who estimated the
actual decline in consumption suggest that it fell less than $40 billion.
15
Why did
consumption decline less than economic theory suggests? Perhaps the reason is
that the rise in stock prices had been very recent—stock prices had risen 39% in the
8 months preceding the crash. Because the increase in stock prices occurred so
rapidly, it is possible that by August 1987, stockholders had not yet fully adjusted
their consumption to reﬂect the higher level of wealth. Thus, when the market
fell, consumption did not have to decline by very much to fall back into line with
wealth.

In “Consumption, Aggregate Wealth, and Expected Stock Returns,” Journal of Finance, June 2001, 
pp. 815–849, Martin Lettau and Sydney Ludvigson noted that, prior to the crash, aggregate
consumption was unusually low relative to stock market wealth. Their analysis indicates that this
behavior reﬂected consumers’ expectations of a decline in the stock market.

140 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Consumption and the Rise in Stock Market Wealth in the 1990s
The U.S. stock market enjoyed tremendous growth during the 1990s. The S&P 500
index more than tripled in real terms by the end of the decade. Our theory predicts
that such gains in stock market wealth should be associated with increased con-
sumption spending.
However, contrary to our theory that an increase in wealth should increase con-
sumption, consumption does not appear to have been closely correlated with stock
prices in the 1990s. Research by Jonathan Parker of Northwestern University shows
that there has been a long-run increase in the ratio of consumption to GDP that began
in 1979.
17
He concludes that no more than one-ﬁfth of the increase in the ratio of con-
sumption to GDP in the 1980s and 1990s resulted from increased wealth associated
with the stock market boom. And in Fig. 4.11, we can see that stock prices increased sig-
niﬁcantly from 1995 to 1998, yet consumption declined relative to GDP in that period.
Consumption and the Decline in Stock Prices in the Early 2000s
Following the peak of the stock market in early 2000, stock prices declined for three
years, erasing about $5 trillion in wealth. Our theory suggests that consumers
should respond by reducing their consumption spending. Yet Fig. 4.11 shows that,
in fact, consumption spending increased signiﬁcantly relative to GDP during that
period, rising from 67% of GDP in 1999 to 70% in 2002. Several reasons may explain
why consumption did not decline after stock prices fell: (1) the reduction in people’s
wealth is spread throughout their lifetimes, so there is not a large immediate impact
on consumption; (2) at the same time stock prices declined, home prices rose, so
many people who lost wealth in the stock market gained it back in real estate; and
(3) people may have just viewed their gains in the late 1990s as “paper proﬁts” that
were lost in the early 2000s, so neither the gains nor the losses affected consumption.
Investment and the Declines in the Stock Market in the 2000s
As we have seen in Fig. 4.11, the stock market fell precipitously in 2000 and 2008.
The large declines in the stock market led to large declines in Tobin’s q, the ratio of
the market value of ﬁrms to the replacement cost of their capital, as you can see in
Figure 4.7 in “In Touch with Data and Research:  Investment and the Stock Market,"
p. 132. This ﬁgure also shows very sharp declines in real investment beginning
shortly after the stock market and Tobin’s q began to fall in 2000 and again in 2008.
The slight delay in the fall in investment, relative to the fall in the stock market,
reﬂects the lags in the process of making investment decisions, planning capital for-
mation, and implementing the plans. But despite these lags, the declines in invest-
ment following large declines in the stock market are quite evident.
The Financial Crisis of 2008
During the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, stock prices plunged rapidly. In the six months
from August 2008 to February 2009, U.S. stock prices declined in nominal terms by
43%, one of the fastest declines in stock prices on record. Investors feared that a
depression was possible because of a meltdown in the ﬁnancial sector, which had
taken excessive risks, especially in real-estate markets. The recession that had

begun in December 2007 became much worse, and the unemployment rate
increased dramatically. In this case, unlike the episode in the early 2000s, home
prices also declined, and the simultaneous decline in housing prices and stock
values translated into a nearly 20% decline in household net wealth, which fell
from $62.6 trillion at the end of 2007 to $50.4 trillion by the end of March 2009. Yet
the ratio of consumption to GDP only declined about 1 percentage point in 2008, as
Fig. 4.11 shows, and then it rebounded in early 2009.
CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. Because saving equals income minus consumption, a
household’s decisions about how much to consume
and how much to save are really the same decision.
Individuals and households save because they value
both future consumption and current consumption;
for the same amount of income, an increase in current
saving reduces current consumption but increases the
amount that the individual or household will be able
to consume in the future.
2. For an individual or household, an increase in current
income raises both desired consumption and desired
saving. Analogously, at the national level, an increase
in current output raises both desired consumption and
desired national saving. At both the household and
national levels, an increase in expected future income
or in wealth raises desired consumption; however,
because these changes raise desired consumption
without affecting current income or output, they cause
desired saving to fall.
3. An increase in the real interest rate has two poten-
tially offsetting effects on saving. First, a higher real
interest rate increases the price of current consump-
tion relative to future consumption (each unit of cur-
rent consumption costs units of forgone future
consumption). In response to the increased relative
price of current consumption, people substitute
future consumption for current consumption by
saving more today. This tendency to increase saving
in response to an increase in the relative price of cur-
rent consumption is called the substitution effect of
the real interest rate on saving. Second, a higher real
interest rate increases the wealth of savers by increas-
ing the interest payments they receive, while reduc-
ing the wealth of borrowers by increasing the
amount of interest they must pay. By making savers
wealthier, an increase in the real interest rate leads
savers to consume more and reduce their saving;
however, because it makes borrowers poorer, an
increase in the real interest rate causes borrowers to
reduce their consumption and increase their saving.
The change in current consumption that results
1 + r
because a consumer is made richer or poorer by an
increase in the real interest rate is called the income
effect of the real interest rate on saving.
For a saver, the substitution effect of an increase
in the real interest rate (which tends to boost saving)
and the income effect (which tends to reduce saving)
work in opposite directions, so that the overall effect
is ambiguous. For a borrower, both the substitution
effect and the income effect of a higher real interest
rate act to increase saving. Overall, empirical studies
suggest that an increase in the real interest rate
increases desired national saving and reduces desired
consumption, but not by very much.
The real interest rate that is relevant to saving
decisions is the expected after-tax real interest rate,
which is the real return that savers expect to earn after
paying a portion of the interest they receive in taxes.
4. With total output held constant, a temporary increase
in government purchases reduces desired consump-
tion. The reason is that higher government purchas-
es imply increases in present or future taxes, which
makes consumers feel poorer. However, the decrease
in desired consumption is smaller than the increase
in government purchases, so that desired national
saving, , falls as a result of a temporary
increase in government purchases.
5. According to the Ricardian equivalence proposition,
a current lump-sum tax cut should have no effect on
desired consumption or desired national saving.
The reason is that, if no change occurs in current or
planned government purchases, a tax cut that
increases current income must be offset by future
tax increases that lower expected future income. If
consumers do not take into account expected future
tax changes, however, the Ricardian equivalence
proposition will not hold and a tax cut is likely to
raise desired consumption and lower desired
national saving.
6. The desired capital stock is the level of capital that
maximizes expected profits. At the desired capital
stock, the expected future marginal product of capital

equals the user cost of capital. The user cost of capi-
tal is the expected real cost of using a unit of capital
for a period of time; it is the sum of the depreciation
cost (the loss in value because the capital wears out)
and the interest cost (the interest rate times the price
of the capital good).
7. Any change that reduces the user cost of capital or
increases the expected future marginal product of cap-
ital increases the desired capital stock. A reduction in
the taxation of capital, as measured by the effective
tax rate, also increases the desired capital stock.
8. Gross investment is spending on new capital goods.
Gross investment minus depreciation (worn-out or
scrapped capital) equals net investment, or the
change in the capital stock. Firms invest so as to
achieve their desired level of capital stock; when the
desired capital stock increases, ﬁrms invest more.
9. The goods market is in equilibrium when the aggre-
gate quantity of goods supplied equals the aggregate
quantity of goods demanded, which (in a closed
economy) is the sum of desired consumption, desired
investment, and government purchases of goods and
services. Equivalently, the goods market is in equi-
librium when desired national saving equals desired
investment. For any given level of output, the goods
market is brought into equilibrium by changes in the
real interest rate.
10. The determination of goods market equilibrium, for
any ﬁxed supply of output, , is represented graphi-
cally by the saving–investment diagram. The saving
curve slopes upward because empirical evidence
suggests that a higher real interest rate raises desired
saving. The investment curve slopes downward
because a higher real interest rate raises the user cost
of capital, which lowers ﬁrms’ desired capital stocks
and thus the amount of investment they do. Changes
in variables that affect desired saving or investment
shift the saving or investment curves and change the
real interest rate that clears the goods market.

that change desired investment for a given real
interest rate shift the investment curve; see

desired investment. Shifts of either curve change
the goods market equilibrium point and thus
change national saving, investment, and the real
interest rate.

NUMERICAL PROBLEMS
All numerical problems are available in 
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. A consumer is making saving plans for this year and
next. She knows that her real income after taxes will be
$50,000 in both years. Any part of her income saved this
year will earn a real interest rate of 10% between this
year and next year. Currently, the consumer has no
wealth (no money in the bank or other ﬁnancial assets,
and no debts). There is no uncertainty about the future.
The consumer wants to save an amount this year
that will allow her to (1) make college tuition payments
next year equal to $12,600 in real terms; (2) enjoy exactly
the same amount of consumption this year and next
year, not counting tuition payments as part of next year’s
consumption; and (3) have neither assets nor debts at
the end of next year.
a. How much should the consumer save this year?
How much should she consume?
How are the amounts that the consumer should
save and consume affected by each of the following
changes (taken one at a time, with other variables held
at their original values)?
b. Her current income rises from $50,000 to $54,200.
c. The income she expects to receive next year rises
from $50,000 to $54,200.
d. During the current year she receives an inheritance
of $1050 (an increase in wealth, not income).
e. The expected tuition payment for next year rises
from $12,600 to $14,700 in real terms.
f. The real interest rate rises from 10% to 25%.
2. Hula hoop fabricators cost $100 each. The Hi-Ho Hula
Hoop Company is trying to decide how many of these
machines to buy. HHHHC expects to produce the fol-
lowing number of hoops each year for each level of cap-
ital stock shown.
M04_ABEL4529_07_SE_C04.QXD  12/11/09  1:42 AM  Page 144
Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment 145
Hula hoops have a real value of $1 each. HHHHC has no
other costs besides the cost of fabricators.
a. Find the expected future marginal product of capi-
tal (in terms of dollars) for each level of capital. The
for the third fabricator, for example, is the
real value of the extra output obtained when the
third fabricator is added.
b. If the real interest rate is 12% per year and the
depreciation rate of capital is 20% per year, ﬁnd the
user cost of capital (in dollars per fabricator per
year). How many fabricators should HHHHC buy?
c. Repeat Part ( ) for a real interest rate of 8% per year.
d. Repeat Part ( ) for a 40% tax on HHHHC’s sales
revenues.
e. A technical innovation doubles the number of
hoops a fabricator can produce. How many fabri-
cators should HHHHC buy when the real interest
rate is 12% per year? 8% per year? Assume that
there are no taxes and that the depreciation rate is
still 20% per year.
3. You have just taken a job that requires you to move to
a new city. In relocating, you face the decision of
whether to buy or rent a house. A suitable house costs
$300,000 and you have saved enough for the down
payment. The (nominal) mortgage interest rate is 10%
per year, and you can also earn 10% per year on sav-
ings. Mortgage interest payments are tax deductible,
interest earnings on savings are taxable, and you are in
a 30% tax bracket. Interest is paid or received, and
taxes are paid, on the last day of the year. The expect-
ed inﬂation rate is 5% per year.
The cost of maintaining the house (replacing worn-
out rooﬁng, painting, and so on) is 6% of the value of the
house. Assume that these expenses also are paid entirely
on the last day of the year. If the maintenance is done, the
house retains its full real value. There are no other rele-
vant costs or expenses.
a. What is the expected after-tax real interest rate on
the home mortgage?
b. What is the user cost of the house?
c. If all you care about is minimizing your living
expenses, at what (annual) rent level would you be
just indifferent between buying a house and renting
b

f
a house of comparable quality? Rent is also paid on
the last day of the year.
4. The Missing Link Chain-Link Fence Company is
trying to determine how many chain-link fabricating
machines to buy for its factory. If we deﬁne a chain-
link fence of some speciﬁed length to be equal to one
unit of output, the price of a new fabricating machine
is 60 units of output, and the price of a one-year-old
machine is 51 units of output. These relative prices are
expected to be the same in the future. The expected
future marginal product of fabricating machines, mea-
sured in units of output, is , where is the
number of machines in use. There are no taxes of any
sort. The real interest rate is 10% per year.
a. What is the user cost of capital? Specify the units in
which your answer is measured.
b. Determine the number of machines that will allow
Missing Link to maximize its proﬁt.
c. Suppose that Missing Link must pay a tax equal to
40% of its gross revenue. What is the optimal
number of machines for the company?
d. Suppose that in addition to the 40% tax on revenue
described in Part ( ), the ﬁrm can take advantage of
a 20% investment tax credit, which allows it to
reduce its taxes paid by 20% of the cost of any new
machines purchased. What is Missing Link’s desired
capital stock now? (Hint: An investment tax credit
effectively reduces the price of capital to the ﬁrm.)

ment fall as the real interest rate rises?
b. Find desired national saving for each value of the
real interest rate.
c. If the goods market is in equilibrium, what are the
values of the real interest rate, desired national
saving, and desired investment? Show that both

Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8), are satisﬁed at the equilibrium.
Assume that output is ﬁxed at its full-employment

ernment purchases, , are 1200. Desired consumption
and desired investment are

a. Find an equation relating desired national saving,
, to and .
b. Using both versions of the goods market equilibrium
condition, Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8), ﬁnd the real interest
rate that clears the goods market. Assume that
output equals full-employment output.
c. Government purchases rise to 1440. How does
this increase change the equation describing
desired national saving? Show the change graph-
ically. What happens to the market-clearing real
interest rate?
7. Suppose that the economywide expected future mar-
ginal product of capital is , where
is the future capital stock. The depreciation rate of
capital, , is 20% per period. The current capital stock is
900 units of capital. The price of a unit of capital is 1
unit of output. Firms pay taxes equal to 15% of their
output. The consumption function in the economy is
, where is consumption, is
output, and is the real interest rate. Government pur-
chases equal 200, and full-employment output is 1000.
a. Suppose that the real interest rate is 10% per
period. What are the values of the tax-adjusted user
cost of capital, the desired future capital stock, and
the desired level of investment?
b. Now consider the real interest rate determined by
goods market equilibrium. This part of the problem
will guide you to this interest rate.

current real income of 90, and future real income of 110.
The real interest rate is 10% per period.
a. Find the consumer’s .
b. Write the equation for the consumer’s budget con-
straint (using the given numerical values) and
graph the budget line.
Suppose that the consumer’s goal is to smooth con-
sumption completely. That is, he wants to have the
same level of consumption in both the current and the
future period.
c. How much will he save and consume in the current
period?
d. How will his current saving and consumption be
affected by an increase of 11 in current income?
e. How will his current saving and consumption be
affected by an increase of 11 in future income?
f. How will his current saving and consumption be
affected by an increase of 11 in his initial wealth?
9. (Appendix 4.A) A consumer lives three periods, called
the learning period, the working period, and the retire-
ment period. Her income is 200 during the learning
period, 800 during the working period, and 200 again
during the retirement period. The consumer’s initial
assets are 300. The real interest rate is zero. The consumer
desires perfectly smooth consumption over her lifetime.

assuming no borrowing constraints? What hap-
pens if the consumer faces a borrowing constraint
that prevents her from borrowing?
b. Assume that the consumer’s initial wealth is zero
instead of 300. Repeat Part ( ). Does being bor-

ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. Use the saving–investment diagram to analyze the
effects of the following on national saving, investment,
and the real interest rate. Explain your reasoning.
a. Consumers become more future-oriented and thus
decide to save more.
b. The government announces a large, one-time
bonus payment to veterans returning from a war.
The bonus will be financed by additional taxes
levied on the general population over the next ﬁve
years.
M04_ABEL4529_07_SE_C04.QXD  12/11/09  1:42 AM  Page 146
Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment 147
c. The government introduces an investment tax
credit (offset by other types of taxes, so total tax
collections remain unchanged).
d. A large number of accessible oil deposits are dis-
covered, which increases the expected future mar-
ginal product of oil rigs and pipelines. It also
causes an increase in expected future income.
2. A country loses much of its capital stock to a war.
a. What effects should this event have on the coun-
try’s current employment, output, and real wage?
b. What effect will the loss of capital have on desired
investment?
c. The effects on desired national saving of the
wartime losses are ambiguous. Give one reason for
desired saving to rise and one reason for it to fall.
d. Assume that desired saving doesn’t change. What
effect does the loss of capital have on the country’s
real interest rate and the quantity of investment?
3. a. Analyze the effects of a temporary increase in the
price of oil (a temporary adverse supply shock) on
current output, employment, the real wage, national
saving, investment, and the real interest rate. Because
the supply shock is temporary, you should assume
that the expected future MPK and households’
expected future incomes are unchanged. Assume
throughout that output and employment remain at
full-employment levels (which may change).
b. Analyze the effects of a permanent increase in the
price of oil (a permanent adverse supply shock) on
current output, employment, the real wage, nation-
al saving, investment, and the real interest rate.
Show that in this case, unlike the case of a temporary
supply shock, the real interest rate need not change.
(Hint: A permanent adverse supply shock lowers the
current productivity of capital and labor, just as a
temporary supply shock does. In addition, a perma-
nent supply shock lowers both the expected future
and households’ expected future incomes.)
4. Economists often argue that a temporary increase in
government purchases—say, for military purposes—
will crowd out private investment. Use the saving–
investment diagram to illustrate this point, explain-
ing why the curve(s) shift. Does it matter whether the
MPK
temporary increase in military spending is funded by
taxes or by borrowing?
Alternatively, suppose that the temporary increase
in government purchases is for infrastructure (roads,
sewers, bridges) rather than for military purposes. The
government spending on infrastructure makes private
investment more productive, increasing the expected
future at each level of the capital stock. Use the
saving–investment diagram to analyze the effects of gov-
ernment infrastructure spending on current consump-
tion, national saving, investment, and the real interest
rate. Does investment by private ﬁrms get crowded out
by this kind of government investment? If not, what kind
of spending, if any, does get crowded out? Assume that
there is no change in current productivity or current
output and assume also (for simplicity) that households
do not expect a change in their future incomes.
5. “A permanent increase in government purchases has a
larger effect than a temporary increase of the same
amount.” Use the saving–investment diagram to evaluate
this statement, focusing on effects on consumption, invest-
ment, and the real interest rate for a ﬁxed level of output.
(Hint: The permanent increase in government purchases
implies larger increases in current and future taxes.)
6. (Appendix 4.A) Draw a budget line and indifference
curves for a consumer who initially is a borrower. Be
sure to indicate the no-borrowing, no-lending point and
the optimal consumption point. Then show the effect on
the budget line and the consumer’s optimal consump-
tion of an increase in the real interest rate. Using an inter-
mediate budget line, show the income effect and the
substitution effect. Do they work in the same direction or
in opposite directions? Explain your answer.
7. (Appendix 4.A) Consumers typically pay a higher real
interest rate to borrow than they receive when they lend
(by making bank deposits, for example). Draw a con-
sumer’s budget line under the assumption that the real

1. Graph the index of consumer sentiment, using data since
1965. Can you pick out the recessions of 1969–1970,
1973–1975, 1980, 1981–1982, 1990–1991, and 2001 and the

durables, using quarterly data since 1965. Generally
speaking, does consumption grow more quickly when
consumers are more optimistic? Compare the growth
rates of real consumption and of real consumption
expenditures on durables during recessions.
2. The S&P 500 stock market index measures the total
dollar value of a large set of stocks traded on the stock
market. The real value of the S&P index, which mea-
sures the real value of the wealth represented by that set
of stocks, is obtained by dividing the index by a measure
of the price level, such as the CPI. (To obtain monthly
data on the S&P 500, go to the Web site ﬁnance.yahoo.com
and get data for ticker symbol: ^GSPC.)
Using monthly data for the period since 1961,
graph the real value of the S&P 500 stock market
index. What striking difference do you see in com-
paring the values in the 1970s with the values in the
rest of the period? According to the theory, what
effect should the behavior of stock market wealth
during the 1970s have had on the national saving
rate during that period, relative to the 1960s and
1980s? Look at a graph of the national saving rate
for 1961 to the present from NIPA Table 5.1 at
www.bea.gov. Would you say that the prediction is
borne out? Discuss.
3. This problem asks you to calculate the actual (as
opposed to the expected) after-tax real interest rate using

during recessions? In this respect, is residential
investment similar to or different from other types

b. During the two decades after World War II, there was
an upsurge in population growth and household for-

was followed by a “baby bust” during which popu-

trends connected to the behavior of residential invest-
ment relative to GDP shown in your graph?
5. The chapter claims that interest rates tend to move
together. Using monthly data since 1975, graph the inter-

grade corporate bonds, the interest rate on FHA
mortgages, the prime rate charged by banks, and the
yield on ten-year Treasury bonds. Which interest rates
tend to be highest? Lowest? Explain. Which interest rates
tend to move together? Explain.

A Formal Model of 
Consumption and Saving
This appendix analyzes more formally the decision about how much to consume
and how much to save. We focus on the decisions of a consumer named Prudence,
who was introduced in Chapter 4. To help keep the analysis manageable, we make
three simplifying assumptions:
1. The time horizon over which Prudence makes plans consists of only two peri-
ods: the present, or current, period and the future period. The current period
might represent Prudence’s working years and the future period might repre-
sent her retirement years, for example.
2. Prudence takes her current income, future income, and wealth as given.
3. Prudence faces a given real interest rate and can choose how much to borrow
or save at that rate.
How Much Can the Consumer Afford? The Budget Constraint
To analyze Prudence’s decision about how much to consume and save, we ﬁrst exam-
ine the choices available to her. To have some speciﬁc numbers to analyze, let’s sup-
pose that Prudence receives a ﬁxed after-tax income, measured in real terms,
1
of
42,000 in the current period and expects to receive a real income of 33,000 in the
future period. In addition, she begins the current period with real wealth of 18,000 in
a savings account, and she can borrow or lend at a real interest rate of 10% per period.
Next, we list the symbols used to represent Prudence’s situation:
= Prudence’s current real income (42,000);
= Prudence’s future real income (33,000);
2
= Prudence’s real wealth (assets) at the beginning of the current
period (18,000);
= real interest rate (10%);
= Prudence’s current real consumption (not yet determined);
= Prudence’s future real consumption (not yet determined).
In general, any amount of current consumption, , that Prudence chooses will
determine the amount of future consumption, , that she will be able to afford. To
work out this relationship, note that the funds that Prudence has on hand in the
current period are her current income, , and her initial wealth, . If her current con-
sumption is , then at the end of the current period she has left. y + a - c c

Prudence can put these leftover current resources, , in the bank to earn
interest. If the real interest rate that she can earn on her deposit is , the real value of her
bank account (principal plus interest) in the future period will be . In
addition to the real value of her bank account in the future period, Prudence receives
income of , so her total resources in the future period equal .
Because the future period is the last period of Prudence’s life, she spends all of her
remaining resources on consumption.
3
Thus Prudence’s future consumption, , is
(4.A.1)
Equation (4.A.1) is called the budget constraint. It shows for any level of current con-
sumption, , how much future consumption, , Prudence can afford, based on her
current and future income and initial wealth.
4
The budget constraint in Eq. (4.A.1)
is represented graphically by the budget line, which shows the combinations of cur-
rent and future consumption that Prudence can afford, based on her current and
future income, her initial level of wealth, and the real interest rate. Figure 4.A.1
depicts Prudence’s budget line, with current consumption, c, on the horizontal
axis and future consumption, , on the vertical axis.
The budget line slopes downward, reﬂecting the trade-off between current
and future consumption. If Prudence increases her current consumption by one
unit, her saving falls by one unit. Because saving earns interest at rate , a one-unit r

Here we assume that Prudence does not want to leave a bequest to anyone. Later we will brieﬂy
examine the effect of bequests on saving decisions.

In our derivation of Eq. (4.A.1), we assumed that Prudence’s current consumption was less than her
total current resources so that she had some resources left to deposit in the bank. However, the
budget constraint, Eq. (4.A.1), still works if Prudence’s current consumption exceeds her total current
resources so that she must borrow from the bank. Note that this works as long as exceeds

decline in saving today implies that Prudence’s future resources—and thus her
future consumption—will be lower by units. Because a one-unit increase in
current consumption lowers future consumption by units, the slope of the
budget line is – . In our numerical example, the real interest rate is 10%, so
the slope of the budget line in Fig. 4.A.1 is –1.10.
Present Values
We can conveniently represent Prudence’s budget constraint by using the concept
of present value. The present value measures the value of payments to be made in
the future in terms of today’s dollars or goods. To illustrate this concept, suppose
that you must make a payment of $13,200 one year from now. How much money
would you have to put aside today so that you could make that future payment?
The answer to this question is called the present value.
The present value of a future payment depends on the interest rate. If the cur-
rent nominal interest rate, , is 10% per year, the present value of $13,200 to be paid
one year from now is $12,000. The reason is that $12,000 deposited in the bank
today at a 10% interest rate will earn $1200 (10% of $12,000) of interest in one year,
which, when added to the initial $12,000, gives the $13,200. Therefore, at an inter-
est rate of 10%, having $13,200 one year from now is economically equivalent to
having $12,000 today. Thus, we say that the present value of $13,200 in one year
equals $12,000.
More generally, if the nominal interest rate is per year, each dollar in the bank
today is worth dollars one year from now. To have $13,200 one year from now
requires in the bank today; thus the present value of $13,200 to be
paid one year from now is . As we have already shown, if 
per year, the present value of $13,200 one year from now is .
If per year, the present value of $13,200 one year in the future is
. Hence an increase in the interest rate reduces the present
value of a future payment. Similarly, a decline in the interest rate increases the pre-
sent value of a future payment.
If future payments are measured in nominal terms, as in the preceding exam-
ple, the appropriate interest rate for calculating present values is the nominal inter-
est rate, . If future payments are measured in real terms, present values are
calculated in exactly the same way, except that we use the real interest rate, ,
rather than the nominal interest rate, . In analyzing Prudence’s
consumption–saving decision, we’re measuring everything in real terms, so we use
the real interest rate, , to calculate the present values of Prudence’s future income
and consumption.
Present Value and the Budget Constraint
We deﬁne the present value of lifetime resources ( ) as the present value of the
income that a consumer expects to receive in current and future periods plus initial
wealth. In the two-period case, the present value of lifetime resources is
(4.A.2)
which is the sum of current income, ,
5
the present value of future income, , 
and current wealth, . In our example, Prudence has

152 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Next, we divide both sides of Eq. (4.A.1) by and then add to both sides
to get
(4.A.3)
The left side of Eq. (4.A.3) is the present value of lifetime consumption,
, which we denote . The budget constraint in Eq. (4.A.3) states
that the present value of lifetime consumption ( ) equals the present value of life-
time resources .
In terms of Fig. 4.A.1, and indeed for any graph of the budget line, equals
the value of current consumption, , at the horizontal intercept of the budget line
because the horizontal intercept is the point on the budget line at which future con-
sumption, , equals zero. Setting future consumption, , to zero in Eq. (4.A.3) yields
current consumption, , on the left side of the equation, which must equal on
the right side. Thus at the horizontal intercept of the budget line.
What Does the Consumer Want? Consumer Preferences
The budget constraint, represented graphically as the budget line, shows the com-
binations of current and future consumption available to Prudence. To determine
which of the many possible consumption combinations Prudence will choose, we
need to know something about Prudence’s preferences for current versus future
consumption.
Economists use the term utility to describe the satisfaction or well-being of an indi-
vidual. Preferences about current versus future consumption are summarized by how
much utility a consumer obtains from each combination of current and future con-
sumption. We can graphically represent Prudence’s preferences for current versus
future consumption through indifference curves, which represent all combinations of
current and future consumption that yield the same level of utility . Because Prudence
is equally happy with all consumption combinations on an indifference curve, she
doesn’t care (that is, she is indifferent to) which combination she actually gets.
Figure 4.A.2 shows two of Prudence’s indifference curves. Because the consumption
combinations corresponding to points , , and all are on the same indifference
curve, IC
1
, Prudence would obtain the same level of utility at , , and .
Indifference curves have three important properties, each of which has an eco-
nomic interpretation and each of which appears in Fig. 4.A.2:
1. Indifference curves slope downward from left to right. To understand why,
let’s suppose that Prudence has selected the consumption combination at point
, where and .
6
Now suppose that Prudence must reduce
her current consumption to . Clearly, if she reduces current consump-
tion while maintaining future consumption at 45,000, she will suffer a reduction
in utility. However, Prudence can be compensated for this reduction in current
consumption by additional future consumption. Suppose that, if she increases
her future consumption to when her current consumption falls to c

Point lies below Prudence’s budget line, shown in Fig. 4.A.1, which means that not only could Pru-
dence afford this consumption combination, but she would have resources left over at the end of the
future period. Unless she wants to leave a bequest, she would not actually choose such a combination
for the resources shown in Fig. 4.A.1.

Indifference curves
All points on an indiffer-
ence curve represent con-
sumption combinations
that yield the same level
of utility. Indifference
curves slope downward
because a consumer can
be compensated for a
reduction in current con-
sumption by an appropri-
ate increase in future
consumption. All points
on represent con-
sumption combinations
that are preferred to all
consumption combina-
tions represented by
points on . Indifference
curves are bowed toward
the origin to reﬂect the
consumption-smoothing
motive. Prudence prefers
the consumption combi-
nation at point , which
is an average of the com-
binations at points and
because represents a
smoother pattern of con-
sumption. Thus the indif-
ference curve containing

, so that she moves to point , her level of utility remains unchanged.
In such a case, she is indifferent between the consumption combinations at 
and , and points and must lie on the same indifference curve. In general,
any change in the level of current consumption must be accompanied by a
change in the opposite direction in the level of future consumption so as to keep
Prudence’s level of utility unchanged. Thus indifference curves, which repre-
sent consumption combinations with equal levels of utility, must slope down-
ward from left to right.
2. Indifference curves that are farther up and to the right represent higher levels of util-
ity. Consider for example point , which lies above and to the right of point in
Fig. 4.A.2. Both current consumption and future consumption are higher at than
at . Because Prudence obtains utility from both current and future consumption, 
offers a higher level of utility than does ; that is, Prudence prefers to . In fact,
as all points on the indifference curve yield the same level of utility as , Pru-
dence prefers to all points on the indifference curve . Furthermore, as all
points on indifference curve yield the same level of utility as , Prudence
prefers all points on to all points on . In general, for any two indifference
curves, consumers prefer consumption combinations on an indifference curve that
is above and to the right of the other indifference curve.
3. Indifference curves are bowed toward the origin. This characteristic shape of
indifference curves captures the consumption-smoothing motive, discussed in
Chapter 4. Under the consumption-smoothing motive, consumers prefer a rela-
tively smooth pattern of consumption over time to having large amounts of con-
sumption in one period and small amounts in another period. We can illustrate
the link between the shape of indifference curves and the consumption-smooth-
ing motive by considering the following three consumption combinations in

similarly, future consumption at , also 51,000, is the average of future
consumption at and , 63,000 and 39,000, respectively.
Even though point essentially is an average of points and , and Prudence
is indifferent between and , she prefers to and because represents
much “smoother” (more even) consumption. Graphically, her preference for

between and . The only way that can lie above and to the right of is if 
bows toward the origin, as depicted in Fig. 4.A.2. Thus the bowed shape of the
indifference curve reﬂects the consumption-smoothing motive.
The Optimal Level of Consumption
Combining Prudence’s budget line (which describes her available consumption
combinations) and her indifference curves (which describe her preferences for cur-
rent versus future consumption), we can ﬁnd the levels of current consumption and
saving that make her happiest. This best available, or optimal, level of current con-
sumption and saving is re presented graphically by the point at which Prudence’s
budget line is tangent to an indifference curve, shown as point in Fig. 4.A.3. D

To see why Prudence achieves her highest possible level of satisfaction, or
utility, at point , ﬁrst note that lies on indifference curve , which means that
all consumption combinations on yield the same level of utility as . All
points on Prudence’s budget line other than point —points such as and , for
example—lie on indifference curves that are below and to the left of . Thus the
consumption combinations represented by all of these other points yield a lower
level of utility than the consumption combination at . Prudence would prefer the
consumption combination represented by a point such as in Fig. 4.A.3 to the con-
sumption combination represented by , because lies on an indifference curve
above and to the right of ; because also lies above the budget line, however,
Prudence can’t afford the consumption combination represented by that point.
With her budget constraint, Prudence can’t do any better than .
We conclude that Prudence’s utility-maximizing consumption and saving
choice is represented by point , where her budget line is tangent to an indifference
curve. Here, her optimal level of current consumption is 45,000, and her optimal
level of future consumption is 49,500. Prudence’s choice of current consumption
automatically determines her current saving, , which equals her current income
minus her optimal current consumption:
Thus Prudence chooses to dissave (decrease her initial assets) by 3000.
The Effects of Changes in Income and Wealth 
on Consumption and Saving
The formal model developed in this appendix provides a helpful insight: The effect
on consumption of a change in current income, expected future income, or wealth depends
only on how that change affects the consumer’s present value of lifetime resources, or
PVLR.
An Increase in Current Income
Suppose that Prudence receives a bonus at work of 12,000, which raises her current
real income from 42,000 to 54,000. Her initial assets (18,000), future income (33,000),
and the real interest rate (10%) remain unchanged; hence the increase of 12,000 in
current income implies an equal increase in Prudence’s present value of lifetime
resources, or . If she hasn’t yet committed herself to her original consump-
tion–saving plan, how might Prudence revise that plan in light of her increased cur-
rent income?
We use the graph in Fig. 4.A.4 to answer this question. In Fig. 4.A.4, is
Prudence’s original budget line, and point , where and ,
represents Prudence’s original, pre-bonus consumption plan. Prudence’s bonus will
allow her to consume more, both now and in the future, so the increase in her income
causes her budget line to shift. To see exactly how it shifts, note that the increase of
12,000 in Prudence’s current income implies that her also increases by 12,000.
Because the horizontal intercept of the budget line occurs at , the bonus
shifts the horizontal intercept to the right by 12,000. The slope of the budget line,
, remains unchanged because the real interest rate is unchanged.
Thus the increase in current income of 12,000 causes a parallel shift of the budget line
to the right by 12,000, from to . BL

That shift demonstrates graphically that, after receiving her bonus, Prudence can
enjoy greater current and future consumption. One strategy for Prudence, repre-
sented by point on the new budget line , is to use the entire bonus to increase
her current consumption by 12,000 while leaving her future consumption
unchanged. Another strategy, represented by point on , is to save all of her
bonus while keeping her current consumption unchanged, and then use both the
bonus and the interest of 1,200 earned on the bonus to increase her future consump-
tion by 13,200.
If Prudence operates under a consumption-smoothing motive, she will use her
bonus to increase both her current consumption and (by saving part of her bonus) her
future consumption, thereby choosing a point on between point (consume the
entire bonus) and point (save the entire bonus). If her indifference curves are as
shown in Fig. 4.A.4, she will move to , where her new budget line, , is tangent to
the indifference curve . At , current consumption, , is 51,000, future consump-
tion, , is 56,100, and saving, , is . Both current and future
consumption are higher at than at (where and ). Pru-
dence’s current saving of 3000 at is higher than her saving was at (where she dis-
saved by 3000) because the increase in her current consumption of 6000 is less than
the increase in her current income of 12,000. This example illustrates that an increase
in current income raises both current consumption and current saving.
An Increase in Future Income
Suppose that Prudence doesn’t receive her bonus of 12,000 in the current period, so
that her current income, , remains at its initial level of 42,000. Instead, because of
an improved company pension plan, she learns that her future income will increase
by 13,200, so rises from 33,000 to 46,200. How will this good news affect Pru-
dence’s current consumption and saving?

Chapter 4 Consumption, Saving, and Investment 157
At a real interest rate of 10%, the improvement in the pension plan increases
the present value of Prudence’s future income by 13,200/1.10, or 12,000. So, as in
the case of the current-period bonus just discussed, the improved pension plan
raises Prudence’s by 12,000 and causes a parallel shift of the budget line to
the right by that amount. The effects on current and future consumption are there-
fore exactly the same as they were for the increase of 12,000 in current income
(and Fig. 4.A.4 applies equally well here).
Although increases in current income and expected future income that are
equal in present value will have the same effects on current and planned future
consumption, the effects of these changes on current saving are different. Previ-
ously, we showed that an increase in current income raises current saving. In con-
trast, because the increase in future income raises current consumption (by 6000 in
this example) but doesn’t affect current income, it causes saving to fall (by 6000,
from –3000 to –9000). Prudence knows that she will be receiving more income in the
future, so she has less need to save today.
An Increase in Wealth
Changes in wealth also affect consumption and saving. As in the cases of current
and future income, the effect of a change in wealth on consumption depends only on
how much the changes. For example, if Prudence ﬁnds a passbook savings
account in her attic worth 12,000, her increases by 12,000. To illustrate this sit-
uation, we use Fig. 4.A.4 again. Prudence’s increase in wealth raises her by
12,000 and thus shifts the budget line to the right by 12,000, from to . As
before, her optimal consumption choice goes from point (before she ﬁnds the
passbook) to point (after her increase in wealth). Because the increase in wealth
raises current consumption (from 45,000 at to 51,000 at ) but leaves current
income (42,000) unchanged, it results in a decline in current saving (from –3000 at 
to –9000 at ). Being wealthier, Prudence does not have to save as much of her cur-
rent income (actually, she is increasing her dissaving) to provide for the future.
The preceding analyses show that changes in current income, future income,
and initial wealth all lead to parallel shifts of the budget line by the amount that
they change the . Economists use the term income effect to describe the impact
of any change that causes a parallel shift of the budget line.
The Permanent Income Theory
In terms of our model, a temporary increase in income represents a rise in cur-
rent income, , with future income, , held constant. A permanent increase in
income raises both current income, , and future income, . Therefore a perma-
nent one-unit increase in income leads to a larger increase in than does a
temporary one-unit increase in income. Because income changes affect con-
sumption only to the extent that they lead to changes in , our theory pre-
dicts that a permanent one-unit increase in income will raise current and future
consumption more than a temporary one-unit increase in income will.
This distinction between the effects of permanent and temporary income
changes is emphasized in the permanent income theory of consumption and saving,
developed in the 1950s by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman. He pointed out that
income should affect consumption only through the in a many-period ver-
sion of the model we present here. Thus permanent changes in income, because
they last for many periods, may have much larger effects on consumption than

Consumption and Saving over Many Periods: The Life-Cycle Model
The two-period model suggests that a signiﬁcant part of saving is intended to pay
for retirement. However, it doesn’t reﬂect other important aspects of a consumer’s
lifetime income and consumption patterns. For example, income typically rises
over most of a person’s working life, and people save for reasons other than retire-
ment. The life-cycle model of consumption and saving, originated in the 1950s by
Nobel laureate Franco Modigliani and his associates, extends the model from two
periods to many periods and focuses on the patterns of income, consumption, and
saving throughout an individual’s life.
The essence of the life-cycle model is shown in Fig. 4.A.5. In Fig. 4.A.5(a), the typ-
ical consumer’s patterns of income and consumption are plotted against the con-
sumer’s age, from age twenty (the approximate age of economic independence) to
age eighty (the approximate age of death). Two aspects of Fig. 4.A.5(a) are signiﬁcant.
First, the average worker experiences steadily rising real income, with peak
earnings typically occurring between the ages of ﬁfty and sixty. After retirement,
income (excluding interest earned from previous saving) drops sharply.
Second, the lifetime pattern of consumption is much smoother than the pattern
of income over time, which is consistent with the consumption-smoothing motive
discussed earlier. Although shown as perfectly ﬂat in Fig. 4.A.5(a), consumption, in
reality, varies somewhat by age; for example, it will be higher during years of high
child-rearing expenses. An advantage of using the life-cycle model to study con-
sumption and saving is that it may be easily modiﬁed to allow for various patterns
of lifetime income and consumption.
The lifetime pattern of saving, shown in Fig. 4.A.5(b), is the difference between the
income and consumption curves in Fig. 4.A.5(a). This overall hump-shaped pattern has
been conﬁrmed empirically . Saving is minimal or even negative during the early work-
ing years, when income is low. Maximum saving occurs when the worker is between
ages ﬁfty and sixty , when income is highest. Finally , dissaving occurs during retirement
as the consumer draws down accumulated wealth to meet living expenses.
An important implication of the hump-shaped pattern of saving is that national
saving rates depend on the age distribution of a country’s population. Countries with
unusually young or unusually old populations have low saving rates, and countries
with relatively more people in their middle years have higher saving rates.
Bequests and Saving
We have assumed that the consumer plans to spend all of his or her wealth and
income during his or her lifetime, leaving nothing to heirs. In reality, many
people leave bequests, or inheritances, to children, charities, and others. To the
extent that consumers desire to leave bequests, they will consume less and save
more than when they simply consume all their resources during their lifetimes.
7
Friedman also provided some of the ﬁrst empirical evidence for this theory. For example, he found
that the consumption of farm families, on average, responded less to changes in income than did the
consumption of nonfarm families. Friedman’s explanation was that, because farm incomes depend
heavily on weather and crop prices, both of which are volatile, changes in farm incomes are much
more likely to be temporary than are changes in nonfarm incomes. Current changes in farm incomes
have a smaller effect on the and therefore have a smaller effect on current consumption. PVLR

(b) Saving is the differ-
ence between income and

pattern is hump-shaped.
Early in a person’s work-

saving is negative. In the

positive; the excess of

Ricardian Equivalence
One of the most signiﬁcant results of analyzing our model is that changes in income
or wealth affect desired consumption only to the extent that they affect the con-
sumer’s . The point made by advocates of Ricardian equivalence, discussed
in Chapter 4, is that, holding current and future government purchases constant, a
change in current taxes does not affect the consumer’s PVLR and thus should not affect
desired consumption, , or desired national saving, .
To illustrate this idea, suppose that the government cuts Prudence’s current taxes
by 300. This tax reduction increases Prudence’s current income by 300, which (all else
being equal) would cause her to consume more. Because the government’s revenue has
been reduced by 300 and its expenditures have not changed, however, the government
must increase its current borrowing from the public by 300 (per taxpayer). Furthermore,
the government must pay interest on its borrowings. For example, if the real interest
rate that the government must pay on its debt is 10%, in the future period the govern-
ment’s outstanding debt will be 330 greater than it would have been without the tax cut.

As a taxpayer, Prudence is ultimately responsible for the government’s debts.
Suppose that the government decides to repay its borrowings and accumulated
interest in the future period (Chapter 15 discusses what happens if the govern-
ment’s debt is left for Prudence’s descendants to repay). To repay its debt plus
interest, the government must raise taxes in the future period by 330, so Prudence’s
expected future income falls by 330. Overall, then, the government’s tax program
has raised Prudence’s current income by 300 but reduced her future income by 330.
At a real interest rate of 10%, the present value of the future income change is
–300, which cancels out the increase in current income of 300. Thus Prudence’s
is unchanged by the tax cut, and (as the Ricardian equivalence proposition
implies) she should not change her current consumption.
Excess Sensitivity and Borrowing Constraints
A variety of studies have confirmed that consumption is affected by current
income, expected future income, and wealth, and that permanent income changes
have larger effects on consumption than do temporary income changes—all of
which are outcomes implied by the model. Nevertheless, some studies show that
the response of consumption to a change in current income is greater than would
be expected on the basis of the effect of the current income change on . This
tendency of consumption to respond to current income more strongly than the
model predicts is called the excess sensitivity of consumption to current income.
One explanation for excess sensitivity is that people are more short-sighted
than assumed in our model and thus consume a larger portion of an increase in
current income than predicted by it. Another explanation, which is more in the
spirit of the model, is that the amount that people can borrow is limited. A restric-
tion imposed by lenders on the amount that someone can borrow against future
income is called a borrowing constraint.
The effect of a borrowing constraint on the consumption–saving decision depends
on whether the consumer would want to borrow in the absence of a borrowing con-
straint. If the consumer wouldn’t want to borrow even if borrowing were possible, the
borrowing constraint is said to be nonbinding. When a consumer wants to borrow but
is prevented from doing so, the borrowing constraint is said to be binding. A consumer
who faces a binding borrowing constraint will spend all available current income and
wealth on current consumption so as to come as close as possible to the consumption
combination desired in the absence of borrowing constraints. Such a consumer would
consume the entire amount of an increase in current income. Thus the effect of an
increase in current income on current consumption is greater for a consumer who faces
a binding borrowing constraint than is predicted by our simple model without bor-
rowing constraints. In macroeconomic terms, this result implies that—if a signiﬁcant
number of consumers face binding borrowing constraints—the response of aggregate
consumption to an increase in aggregate income will be greater than implied by the
basic theory in the absence of borrowing constraints. In other words, if borrowing con-
straints exist, consumption may be excessively sensitive to current income.

Although we have no direct way of counting how many consumers are constrained from borrowing,
several studies estimate that, to account for the observed relationship between consumption and cur-
rent income, during any year some 20% to 50% of U.S. consumers face binding borrowing constraints.

Rates: Reinterpreting the Time Series Evidence,” in O. Blanchard and S. Fischer, eds., NBER Macroeco-
nomics Annual, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1989; and Robert E. Hall and Frederic S. Mishkin, “The

The Real Interest Rate and the Consumption–Saving Decision
To explore the effects of a change in the real interest rate on consumption and saving,
let’s return to the two-period model and Prudence’s situation. Recall that Prudence
initially has current real income, , of 42,000, future income, , of 33,000, initial
wealth, , of 18,000, and that she faces a real interest rate, , of 10%. Her budget line,
which is the same as in Fig. 4.A.1, is shown in Fig. 4.A.6 as . Now let’s see what
happens when for some reason the real interest rate jumps from 10% to 76%.
9
The Real Interest Rate and the Budget Line
To see how Prudence’s budget line is affected when the real interest rate rises, let’s
ﬁrst consider point on the budget line . Point is special in that it is the only
point on the budget line at which current consumption equals current income
plus initial wealth ( ) and future consumption equals future
income ( ). If Prudence chooses this consumption combination, she
doesn’t need to borrow (her current income and initial wealth are just sufﬁcient to
pay for her current consumption), nor does she have any current resources left to
deposit in (lend to) the bank. Thus is the no-borrowing, no-lending point. Because 
involves neither borrowing nor lending, the consumption combination it represents
is available to Prudence regardless of the real interest rate. Thus the no-borrowing,
no-lending point remains on the budget line when the real interest rate changes.
Next, recall that the budget line’s slope is . When the real interest rate,
, jumps from 10% to 76%, the slope of the budget line changes from to
; that is, the new budget line becomes steeper. Because the budget line
becomes steeper but still passes through the no-borrowing, no-lending point, , it
pivots clockwise around point . E

The effect of an

The ﬁgure shows the
effect on Prudence’s
budget line of an increase
in the real interest rate, ,
from 10% to 76%. Because
the slope of a budget line
is and the initial
real interest rate is 10%,
the slope of Prudence’s
initial budget line, , is
–1.10. The initial budget
line, , also passes
through the no-borrow-
ing, no-lending point, ,
which represents the con-
sumption combination
that Prudence obtains by
spending all her current
income and wealth on
current consumption.
Because can still be
obtained when the real
interest rate rises, it also
lies on the new budget

reﬂecting the rise in the
real interest rate to 76%.

est rate causes the budget

162 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
The Substitution Effect
As we discussed in Chapter 4, the price of current consumption in terms of future
consumption is , because if Prudence increases her consumption by one unit
today , thereby reducing her saving by one unit, she will have to reduce her future con-
sumption by units. When the real interest rate increases, current consumption
becomes more expensive relative to future consumption. In response to this increase in
the relative price of current consumption, Prudence substitutes away from current con-
sumption toward future consumption by increasing her saving. This increase in saving
reﬂects the substitution effect of the real interest rate on saving, introduced in Chapter 4.
The substitution effect is illustrated graphically in Fig. 4.A.7. Initially, the real
interest rate is 10% and the budget line is . Suppose for now that Prudence’s
preferences are such that is tangent to an indifference curve, , at the no- bor-
rowing, no-lending point, .
10
At a real interest rate of 10%, Prudence chooses the
consumption combination at .
When the real interest rate rises from 10% to 76%, the budget line pivots clock-
wise to . Because Prudence’s original consumption point—the no-borrowing,
no-lending point, —also lies on the new budget line, , she has the option of
remaining at and enjoying the same combination of current and future con-
sumption after the real interest rate rises. Points along immediately above and
to the left of lie above and to the right of , however. These points represent
consumption combinations that are available to Prudence and yield a higher level
of utility than the consumption combination at . Prudence can attain the highest
level of utility along at point , where indifference curve is tangent to .
In response to the increase in the relative price of current consumption, Prudence
reduces her current consumption, from 60,000 to 51,000, and moves from to on
. Her reduction of 9000 in current consumption between and is equivalent V E BL

to an increase of 9000 in saving. The increase in saving between and reﬂects the
substitution effect on saving of a higher real interest rate.
The Income Effect
If Prudence’s current consumption initially equals her current resources (current
income plus initial wealth) so that she is neither a lender nor a borrower, a change in
the real interest rate has only a substitution effect on her saving, as shown in Fig. 4.A.7.
If her current consumption initially is not equal to her current resources, however, then
an increase in the real interest rate also has an income effect. As we discussed in
Chapter 4, if Prudence is initially a saver (equivalently, a lender), with current con-
sumption less than her current resources (current income plus initial wealth), an
increase in the real interest rate makes her ﬁnancially better off by increasing the
future interest payments that she will receive. In response to this increase in future
interest income, she increases her current consumption and reduces her current
saving. On the other hand, if Prudence is initially a borrower, with current consump-
tion exceeding her current resources, an increase in the real interest rate increases the
interest she will have to pay in the future. Having to make higher interest payments
in the future makes Prudence ﬁnancially worse off overall, leading her to reduce her
current consumption. Thus, for a borrower, the income effect of an increase in the real
interest rate leads to reduced current consumption and increased saving.
The Substitution Effect and the Income Effect Together
Figure 4.A.8 illustrates the full impact of an increase in the real interest rate on
Prudence’s saving, including the substitution and income effects—assuming that Pru-
dence initially is a lender. As before, Prudence’s original budget line is when the
real interest rate is 10%. We now assume that Prudence’s preferences are such that 
is tangent to an indifference curve, , at point . Thus, at a 10% real interest rate, Pru-
dence plans current consumption of 45,000 and future consumption of 49,500. Her cur-
rent resources equal 60,000 (current income of 42,000 plus initial assets of 18,000), so if
she enjoys current consumption of 45,000 she will have resources of 15,000 to lend. Her
chosen point, , is located to the left of the no-borrowing, no-lending point, (current
consumption is lower at than at ), showing that Prudence is a lender.
The increase in the real interest rate from 10% to 76% causes Prudence’s budget
line to pivot clockwise through the no-borrowing, no-lending point, , ending at
as before. To separate the substitution and income effects of the increase in the
real interest rate, think of the movement of the budget line from to as

will choose the consumption combination at . Current and future consumption
are higher, and saving is lower, at than at . The increase in current consumption
and the decrease in saving between and reﬂect the income effect of the increase
in the real interest rate. Thus, as discussed earlier, income effects occur when a
change in some variable causes a parallel shift of the budget line.
The total change in Prudence’s consumption and saving resulting from the rise
in the real interest rate is depicted in Fig. 4.A.8 as the change in saving between
point and point . This change is the sum of the substitution effect, measured by
the increase in saving in moving from to , and the income effect, measured by
the decline in saving in moving from to . In Fig. 4.A.8, current consumption is
lower and saving is higher at the ﬁnal point, , than at the original point, . How-
ever, we could just as easily draw the curves so that saving is less at the ﬁnal point,
, than at the initial point, . Thus the theory fails to predict whether Prudence’s
saving will rise or fall in response to an increase in the real interest rate, because the
income and substitution effects work in opposite directions for a lender.
As we discussed in Chapter 4, for a borrower the income and substitution
effects work in the same direction (Analytical Problem 6 at the end of Chapter 4
asks you to explain this result). A higher real interest rate increases a borrower’s
reward for saving (equivalently, it increases the relative price of current consump-
tion), so he or she tends to save more (the substitution effect); because a borrower
pays rather than receives interest, a higher real interest rate also makes him or her
poorer, leading to less consumption and more saving.
To summarize, the two-period model implies that an increase in the real inter-
est rate increases saving by borrowers. Nevertheless, because of conﬂicting income
and substitution effects, economic theory isn’t decisive about the effect of the real
interest rate on the saving of lenders. As we discussed in Chapter 4, empirical
studies have shown that an increase in the real interest rate tends to increase
desired national saving, though this effect is not very strong.

CHAPTER 5
Saving and Investment 
in the Open Economy
With virtually no exceptions, modern economies are open economies, which means
that they engage in international trade of goods and services and in international
borrowing and lending. Economic openness is of tremendous beneﬁt to the average
person. Because the United States is an open economy, U.S. consumers can enjoy
products from around the world (Japanese MP3 players, Italian shoes, Irish
woolens) and U.S. businesses can ﬁnd new markets abroad for their products
(computers, beef, ﬁnancial services). Similarly, the internationalization of ﬁnancial
markets means that U.S. savers have the opportunity to purchase German govern-
ment bonds or shares in Taiwanese companies as well as domestic assets, and U.S.
ﬁrms that want to ﬁnance investment projects can borrow in London or Tokyo as
well as in New York.
Beyond the economic diversity and opportunity it creates, economic openness
carries another important implication: In an open economy, a country’s spending need
not equal its production in every period, as would be required in a closed economy
with no foreign trade and no international borrowing and lending. In particular, by
importing more than they export and borrowing from abroad to pay for the dif-
ference, the residents of an open economy can temporarily spend more than they
produce.
The ability of an open economy to spend more than it produces is both an
opportunity and a potential problem. For example, by borrowing abroad (and by
selling off U.S.-owned assets to foreign investors), the United States was able to
ﬁnance a large excess of imports over exports during the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. As
a result, U.S. citizens enjoyed higher levels of consumption, investment, and gov-
ernment purchases than they could have otherwise. At the same time, however, they
incurred foreign debts that may be a future burden to the U.S. economy.
Why do countries sometimes borrow abroad to pay for an excess of imports
over exports but at other times export more than they import and lend the difference
to other countries? Why doesn’t each country just balance its books and import as
much as it exports each year? As we explain in this chapter, the fundamental deter-
minants of a country’s trade position are the country’s saving and investment
decisions. Thus although the issues of trade balances and international
lending introduced here may seem at ﬁrst to be unrelated to the topics covered in
Chapter 4, the two sets of questions actually are closely related.
To explore how desired national saving and desired investment help determine
patterns of international trade and lending, we extend the idea of goods market
M05_ABEL4529_07_SE_C05.QXD  12/11/09  1:00 AM  Page 165
166 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
equilibrium, described by the saving–investment diagram, to include a foreign
sector. We show that, unlike the situation in a closed economy, in an open economy
desired national saving and desired investment don’t have to be equal. Instead, we
show that, when a country’s desired national saving exceeds its desired investment,
the country will be a lender in the international capital market and will have a cur-
rent account surplus. Similarly, when a country’s desired national saving is less
than its desired investment, the country will be an international borrower and will
have a current account deﬁcit.
By emphasizing saving and investment, we develop an important theme of this
part of the book. However, to focus on the role of saving and investment, we ignore
some other factors that also inﬂuence international trade and lending. The most
important of these factors is the exchange rate, or the rate at which domestic cur-
rency can be exchanged for foreign currency. We fully discuss exchange rates and
their role in the open economy in Chapter 13.
5.1 Balance of Payments Accounting
Examining the factors that affect international trade and lending ﬁrst requires an
understanding of the basics of balance of payments accounting. The balance of pay-
ments accounts, which are part of the national income accounts discussed in Chapter
2, are the record of a country’s international transactions. (“In Touch with Data and
Research: The Balance of Payments Accounts,” p. 168, contains information about how
the balance of payments accounts are constructed and where to ﬁnd these data.) As
you read this section, you should refer to Table 5.1, which presents U.S. balance of
payments data for 2008; note that some of the numbers are positive and that others are
negative. To sort out which international transactions are entered with a plus sign and
which are entered with a minus sign, keep the following principle in mind: Any
transaction that involves a ﬂow of funds into the United States is a credit item and is
entered with a plus sign; any transaction that involves a ﬂow of funds out of the
United States is a debit item and is entered with a minus sign. We illustrate this prin-
ciple as we discuss the various components of the balance of payments accounts.
The Current Account
The current account measures a country’s trade in currently produced goods and
services, along with unilateral transfers between countries. For convenience we
divide the current account into three separate components: (1) net exports of goods
and services, (2) net income from abroad, and (3) net unilateral transfers.
Net Exports of Goods and Services. We discussed the concept of net exports,
or exports minus imports, as part of the expenditure approach to measuring
GDP in Chapter 2. Here we point out that net exports often are broken into two
categories: goods and services.
Examples of internationally traded goods include U.S. soybeans, French per-
fume, Brazilian coffee, and Japanese cars. When a U.S. consumer buys a Japanese
car, for example, the transaction is recorded as an import of goods for the United
States (a debit item for the United States, because funds ﬂow out of the United
States to pay for the car) and an export of goods for Japan (a credit item for Japan
because funds ﬂow into Japan to pay for the car).

Internationally traded services include tourism, insurance, education, and
ﬁnancial services. The Application “The Impact of Globalization on the U.S. Econ-
omy,” p. 185, discusses trade in business services. When a U.S. family spends a
week’s vacation in Mexico, for example, the family’s expenditures for accommo-
dations, food, sight-seeing tours, and so on, are in the U.S. current account as an
import of tourism services (a debit item for the United States because funds are
ﬂowing out of the country). The family’s expenditures are an export of tourism ser-
vices for Mexico (a credit item in the Mexican current account). Similarly, when a
foreign student attends college in the United States, her tuition payments are an
export of services for the United States and an import of services for her home
country.

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The Balance of Payments Accounts
The data on U.S. international transactions that make up the balance of payments
accounts are produced quarterly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the
U.S. Department of Commerce. The BEA releases data to the public about two and
one-half months after the end of the quarter to which those data refer, and detailed
ﬁgures appear in the January, April, July, and October issues of Survey of Current
Business. Balance of payments data for recent years are revised each June to reﬂect
more complete information, and these revisions are published in the July issue of
Survey of Current Business. Summary data, much like those that appear in Table 5.1,
appear in various publications including the FRED database of the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis and the Economic Report of the President, which is published each
February. Balance of payments data can also be obtained by going to the BEA’s Web
site at www.bea.gov and clicking on “Balance of Payments” under the heading
“International.”
Although full information about the balance of payments accounts is available
only quarterly, some components of the accounts are released monthly. The best-
known example is the trade balance, which equals exports of goods and services
minus imports of goods and services. These data are initially tabulated by the U.S.
Bureau of the Census (which then passes them on to the BEA) and are based pri-
marily on information provided by the U.S. Customs Service, the government
agency responsible for monitoring ﬂows of goods and services in and out of the
country. In recent years, the Census Bureau has also negotiated with the data col-
lection agencies of major U.S. trading partners to swap information about trade
ﬂows. The beneﬁt of exchanging trade information is that it allows the Census
Bureau to ﬁnd out, for example, whether Canadian estimates of the imports they
receive from the United States are similar to U.S. estimates of exports shipped to
Canada. In principle, of course, the two numbers should be the same.
For more information, see Bureau of Economic Analysis, The Balance of Pay-
ments of the United States: Concepts, Data Sources, and Estimating Procedures, Wash-
ington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Ofﬁce, 1990, available at www.bea.gov/scb/

Net factor payments from abroad are presented in the national income and product accounts (NIPA),
and net income from abroad is presented in the balance of payments accounts (BPA). The Bureau of
Economic Analysis publishes a “reconciliation table” (in the Appendix section of BEA Current and
Historical Data in Survey of Current Business) to account for the relatively minor differences between
the NIPA and BPA accounts.
Net Income from Abroad. Net income from abroad equals income receipts from
abroad minus income payments to residents of other countries. It is almost equal
to net factor payments from abroad, discussed in Chapter 2.

We will ignore
the difference between and net income from abroad and treat the two as
equivalent concepts.
The income receipts flowing into a country, which are credit items in the cur-
rent account, consist of compensation received from residents working abroad

Chapter 5 Saving and Investment in the Open Economy 169
plus investment income from assets abroad. Investment income from assets
abroad includes interest payments, dividends, royalties, and other returns that
residents of a country receive from assets (such as bonds, stocks, and patents)
that they own in other countries. For example, the interest that a U.S. saver
receives from a French government bond she owns, or the profits that a U.S.
company receives from a foreign subsidiary, qualify as income receipts from
abroad.
The income payments flowing out of a country, which are debit items in the
current account, consist of compensation paid to foreign residents working in
the country plus payments to foreign owners of assets in the country. For exam-
ple, the wages paid by a U.S. company to a Swedish engineer who is temporar-
ily residing in the United States, or the dividends paid by a U.S. automobile
company to a Mexican owner of stock in the company, are both income pay-
ments to residents of other countries.
Net Unilateral Transfers. Unilateral transfers are payments from one country
to another that do not correspond to the purchase of any good, service, or asset.
Examples are ofﬁcial foreign aid (a payment from one government to another) or
a gift of money from a resident of one country to family members living in
another country. When the United States makes a transfer to another country, the
amount of the transfer is a debit item because funds ﬂow out of the United States.
A country’s net unilateral transfers equal unilateral transfers received by the
country minus unilateral transfers ﬂowing out of the country. The negative value
of net unilateral transfers in Table 5.1 shows that the United States is a net donor
to other countries.
Current Account Balance. Adding all the credit items and subtracting all the
debit items in the current account yields a number called the current account
balance. If the current account balance is positive—with the value of credit
items exceeding the value of debit items—the country has a current
account surplus. If the current account balance is negative—with the value of
debit items exceeding the value of credit items—the country has a current
account deﬁcit. As Table 5.1 shows, in 2008 the United States had a $673.3 billion
current account deﬁcit, equal to the sum of net exports of goods and services
( billion), net income from abroad ( billion), and net
unilateral transfers ( billion).
The Capital and Financial Account
International transactions involving assets, either real or ﬁnancial, are recorded in
the capital and ﬁnancial account, which consists of a capital account and a ﬁnan-
cial account. The capital account encompasses unilateral transfers of assets
between countries, such as debt forgiveness or migrants’ transfers (the assets that
migrants take with them when they move into or out of a country). The capital
account balance measures the net ﬂow of assets unilaterally transferred into the
country. As you can see in Table 5.1, the dollar value of the capital account balance
in the United States was billion in 2008.
Most transactions involving the ﬂow of assets into or out of a country are
recorded in the ﬁnancial account. (Before July 1999, this account was called the

170 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
capital account, so beware: If you use data from a source published before 1999, the
term “capital account” refers to a measure currently known as the financial
account. Even many current discussions still use the term “capital account” to
refer to the “capital and financial account.”) When the home country sells an asset
to another country, the transaction is recorded as a ﬁnancial inﬂow for the home
country and as a credit item in the ﬁnancial account of the home country. For
example, if a U.S. hotel is sold to Italian investors, the transaction is counted as a
ﬁnancial inﬂow to the United States and therefore as a credit item in the U.S.
ﬁnancial account because funds ﬂow into the United States to pay for the hotel.
Similarly, when the home country buys an asset from abroad—say a U.S. resident
opens a Swiss bank account—the transaction involves a ﬁnancial outﬂow from
the home country (the United States in this example) and is recorded as a debit
item in the home country’s ﬁnancial account because funds are ﬂowing out of the
home country.
The ﬁnancial account balance equals the value of ﬁnancial inﬂows (credit
items) minus the value of ﬁnancial outﬂows (debit items). When residents of a
country sell more assets to foreigners than they buy from foreigners, the ﬁnancial
account balance is positive, creating a ﬁnancial account surplus. When residents of
the home country purchase more assets from foreigners than they sell, the ﬁnancial
account balance is negative, creating a ﬁnancial account deﬁcit. Table 5.1 shows that
in 2008 U.S. residents increased their holdings of foreign assets (ignoring unilater-
ally transferred assets) by $52.5 billion while foreigners increased their holdings of
U.S. assets by $599.0 billion. Thus the United States had a ﬁnancial account surplus
of $546.6 billion in 2008 ($599.0 billion minus $52.5 billion with a small difference
because of rounding). The capital and ﬁnancial account balance is the sum of the
capital account balance and the financial account balance. Because the capital
account balance of the United States is so small, the capital and ﬁnancial account
balance is almost equal to the ﬁnancial account balance.
The Official Settlements Balance. In Table 5.1 one set of ﬁnancial account
transactions—transactions in ofﬁcial reserve assets—has been broken out separately.
These transactions differ from other ﬁnancial account transactions in that they are
conducted by central banks (such as the Federal Reserve in the United States), which
are the ofﬁcial institutions that determine national money supplies. Held by central
banks, ofﬁcial reserve assets are assets, other than domestic money or securities, that
can be used in making international payments. Historically, gold was the primary
ofﬁcial reserve asset, but now the ofﬁcial reserves of central banks also include
government securities of major industrialized economies, foreign bank deposits, and
special assets created by the International Monetary Fund.
Central banks can change the quantity of ofﬁcial reserve assets they hold by
buying or selling reserve assets on open markets. For example, the Federal Reserve
could increase its reserve assets by using dollars to buy gold. According to Table 5.1
(see the line “U.S. ofﬁcial reserve assets”), in 2008 the U.S. central bank bought
$4.8 billion of official reserve assets.
2
In the same year foreign central banks
increased their holdings of dollar-denominated reserve assets by $421.4 billion (see
the line “Foreign ofﬁcial assets”). The ofﬁcial settlements balance—also called the

Remember that a negative number in the ﬁnancial account indicates a ﬁnancial outﬂow, or purchase 
of assets.
M05_ABEL4529_07_SE_C05.QXD  12/11/09  1:00 AM  Page 170
Chapter 5 Saving and Investment in the Open Economy 171
balance of payments—is the net increase (domestic less foreign) in a country’s ofﬁ-
cial reserve assets. A country that increases its net holdings of reserve assets during
a year has a balance of payments surplus, and a country that reduces its net hold-
ings of reserve assets has a balance of payments deﬁcit. For the United States in
2008 the ofﬁcial settlements balance was billion (equal to the billion
increase in U.S. reserve assets minus the $421.4 billion increase in foreign dollar-
denominated reserve assets). Thus the United States had a balance of payments
deﬁcit of $416.6 billion in 2008.
For the issues we discuss in this chapter, the balances on current account and
on capital and ﬁnancial account play a much larger role than the balance of pay-
ments. We explain the macroeconomic signiﬁcance of the balance of payments in
Chapter 13 when we discuss the determination of exchange rates.
The Relationship Between the Current Account and the Capital 
and Financial Account
The logic of balance of payments accounting implies a close relationship between
the current account and the capital and ﬁnancial account. Except for errors arising
from problems of measurement, in each period the current account balance and the cap-
ital and ﬁnancial account balance must sum to zero. That is, if
then
(5.1)
The reason that Eq. (5.1) holds is that every international transaction involves
a swap of goods, services, or assets between countries. The two sides of the swap
always have offsetting effects on the sum of the current account and the capital and
ﬁnancial account balances, . Thus the sum of the current account and the
capital and ﬁnancial account balances must equal zero.
Table 5.2 helps clarify this point. Suppose that a U.S. consumer buys an import-
ed British sweater, paying $75 for it. This transaction is an import of goods to the
United States and thus reduces the U.S. current account balance by $75. However,
the British exporter who sold the sweater now holds $75. What will he do with it?
There are several possibilities, any of which will offset the effect of the purchase of
the sweater on the sum of the current account and the capital and ﬁnancial account
balances.
The Briton may use the $75 to buy a U.S. product—say, a computer game. This
purchase is a $75 export for the United States. This U.S. export together with the
original import of the sweater into the United States results in no net change in the
U.S. current account balance . The U.S. capital and ﬁnancial account balance
hasn’t changed, as no assets have been traded. Thus the sum of and 
remains the same.
A second possibility is that the Briton will use the $75 to buy a U.S. asset—say,
a bond issued by a U.S. corporation. The purchase of this bond is a ﬁnancial inﬂow
to the United States. This $75 increase in the U.S. capital and ﬁnancial account off-
sets the $75 reduction in the U.S. current account caused by the original import of
the sweater. Again, the sum of the current account and the capital and ﬁnancial
account balances, , is unaffected by the combination of transactions. CA + KFA

Finally, the Briton may decide to go to his bank and trade his dollars for British
pounds. If the bank sells these dollars to another Briton for the purpose of buying
U.S. exports or assets, or if it buys U.S. assets itself, one of the previous two cases
is repeated. Alternatively, the bank may sell the dollars to the Federal Reserve in
exchange for pounds. But in giving up $75 worth of British pounds, the Federal
Reserve reduces its holdings of ofﬁcial reserve assets by $75, which counts as a
ﬁnancial inﬂow. As in the previous case, the capital and ﬁnancial account balance
rises by $75, offsetting the decline in the current account balance caused by the
import of the sweater.

This example shows why, conceptually, the current account balance and the
capital and ﬁnancial account balance must always sum to zero. In practice, prob-
lems in measuring international transactions prevent this relationship from hold-

obligation of the United States (in particular, of the Federal Reserve), the Briton’s acquisition of dol-
lars would be a credit item in the U.S. capital and ﬁnancial account, which would offset the effect of
the sweater import on the U.S. current account.

account and the capital and ﬁnancial account balances for this sum to reach its the-
oretical value of zero is called the statistical discrepancy. As Table 5.1 shows, in
2008 the statistical discrepancy was $129.3 billion. “In Touch with Data and
Research:  Does Mars Have a Current Account Surplus?” describes a puzzle that
arises because of statistical discrepancies in the balance of payments accounts.
Net Foreign Assets and the Balance of Payments Accounts
In Chapter 2, we defined the net foreign assets of a country as the foreign
assets held by the country’s residents (including, for example, foreign stocks,
bonds, or real estate) minus the country’s foreign liabilities (domestic phys-
ical and financial assets owned by foreigners). Net foreign assets are part of
a country’s national wealth, along with the country’s domestic physical
assets, such as land and the capital stock. The total value of a country’s net
foreign assets can change in two ways: (1) the value of existing foreign assets
and foreign liabilities can change, as when stock held by a U.S. citizen in a
foreign corporation increases in value or the value of U.S. farmland owned
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Does Mars Have a Current Account Surplus?
The exports and imports of any individual country need not be equal in value.
However, as every export is somebody else’s import, for the world as a whole
exports must equal imports and the current account surplus must be zero.
Or must it? When ofﬁcial current account ﬁgures for all nations are added up,
the result is a current account deﬁcit for the world. For example, International
Monetary Fund (IMF) projections for 2009 show that advanced economies had a
collective $371.3 billion current account deﬁcit, and emerging market and devel-
oping countries had a $262.4 billion surplus, which adds up to a current account
deﬁcit for the world as a whole of $108.9 billion. Is planet Earth a net importer, and
does Mars have a current account surplus?
As extraterrestrial trade seems unlikely, the explanation of the Earth’s current
account deﬁcit must lie in statistical and measurement problems. A study by the
IMF concluded that the main problem is the misreporting of income from assets
held abroad. For example, interest earned by a U.S. investor on a foreign bank
account should in principle be counted as a credit item in the U.S. current account
and a debit item in the current account of the foreign country. However, if the U.S.
investor fails to report this interest income to the U.S. government, it may show up
only as a debit to the foreign current account, leading to a measured Earthwide
current account deﬁcit. The fact that the world’s current account deﬁcit is gener-
ally larger during periods of high interest rates provides some support for this
explanation.

SUMMARY 7
Equivalent Measures of a Country’s International Trade 
and Lending
by a foreigner declines; and (2) the country can acquire new foreign assets or
incur new foreign liabilities.
What determines the quantity of new foreign assets that a country can acquire?
In any period the net amount of new foreign assets that a country acquires equals its cur-
rent account surplus. For example, suppose a country exports $10 billion more in
goods and services than it imports and thus runs a $10 billion current account sur-
plus (assuming that net factor payments from abroad, and net unilateral
transfers both are zero). The country must then use this $10 billion to acquire for-
eign assets or reduce foreign liabilities. In this case we say that the country has
undertaken net foreign lending of $10 billion.
Similarly, if a country has a $10 billion current account deﬁcit, it must cover
this deﬁcit either by selling assets to foreigners or by borrowing from foreigners.
Either action reduces the country’s net foreign assets by $10 billion. We describe
this situation by saying that the country has engaged in net foreign borrowing of
$10 billion.
One important way in which a country borrows from foreigners occurs when
a foreign business ﬁrm buys or builds capital goods; this is known as foreign
direct investment. For example, when the Honda Motor Company from Japan
builds a new auto production facility in Ohio, it engages in foreign direct invest-
ment. Because the facility is built in the United States but is ﬁnanced by Japanese
funds, foreign-owned assets in the United States increase, so the capital and ﬁnan-
cial account balance increases. Foreign direct investment is different from portfolio
investment, in which a foreigner acquires securities sold by a U.S. ﬁrm or investor.
An example of portfolio investment occurs when a French investor buys shares of
stock in General Motors Corporation. This transaction also increases the capital and
ﬁnancial account balance, as it represents an increase in foreign-owned assets in the
United States.
Equation (5.1) emphasizes the link between the current account and the
acquisition of foreign assets. Because , if a country has a cur-
rent account surplus, it must have an equal capital and financial account
deficit. In turn, a capital and financial account deficit implies that the country
is increasing its net holdings of foreign assets. Similarly, a current account
deficit implies a capital and financial account surplus and a decline in the
country’s net holdings of foreign assets. Summary table 7 presents some
equivalent ways of describing a country’s current account position and its
acquisition of foreign assets.

APPLICATION
The United States as International Debtor
From about World War I until the 1980s, the United States was a net creditor inter-
nationally; that is, it had more foreign assets than liabilities. Since the early 1980s,
however, the United States has consistently run large annual current account
deﬁcits. These current account deﬁcits have had to be ﬁnanced by net foreign bor-
rowing (which we deﬁne broadly to include the sale of U.S.-owned assets to for-
eigners as well as the incurring of new foreign debts).
The accumulation of foreign debts and the sale of U.S. assets to foreigners
have, over time, changed the United States from a net creditor internationally to a
net debtor. Figure 5.1 shows the U.S. ownership of foreign assets and foreign own-
ership of U.S. assets, both measured as a percent of U.S. GDP, since 1982. As you
can see, foreign ownership of U.S. assets overtook the U.S. ownership of foreign
assets in the mid 1980s and the gap between the two has grown substantially since
then. According to estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, at the end of 2008
the United States had net foreign assets of billion, measured at current
market prices. Equivalently, we could say that the United States had net foreign
debt of $3469 billion.
4
This international obligation of more than $3 trillion is larger
than that of any other country, making the United States the world’s largest inter-
national debtor. This ﬁgure represented an increase of indebtedness of $1331 billion
from yearend 2007. The U.S. current account deﬁcit in 2008 was $673 billion. But the
net debt of the United States rose nearly twice that much in part because of decreas-
es in the value of U.S.-owned assets abroad relative to the value of foreign-owned
assets in the United States.
Although the international debt of the United States is large and growing, the
numbers need to be put in perspective. First, the economic burden created by any
debt depends not on the absolute size of the debt but on its size relative to the
debtor’s economic resources. Even at $3469 billion, the U.S. international debt is
only about 24% of one year’s GDP (U.S. GDP in 2008 was $14,441 billion). By con-
trast, some countries, especially certain developing countries, have ratios of net for-
eign debt to annual GDP that exceed 100%. Second, the large negative net foreign
asset position of the United States doesn’t imply that it is being “bought up” or
“controlled” by foreigners. If we focus on foreign direct investment, in which a res-
ident of one country has ownership in a business in another country and has inﬂu-
ence over the management of that business, it appears that the United States has a
stronger presence in other countries then they do in the United states. At the end of
2008, the market value of U.S. direct investment in foreign countries was $3699 bil-
lion, and the market value of foreign direct investment in the United States was
$2647 billion.

See Nguyen, pp. 14–16. Incidentally, the largest direct investor in the United States isn’t Japan, as is com-
monly believed, but the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom also is the country that receives the most
direct investment from the United States. For data on the distribution of U.S. direct investment abroad
and foreign direct investment in the United States, see Marilyn lbarra and Jennifer Koncz, “Direct Invest-
ment Positions for 2008: Country and Industry Detail,” Survey of Current Business, July 2009, pp. 20–34.

In evaluating the economic signiﬁcance of a country’s foreign debt, you should
also keep in mind that net foreign assets are only part of a country’s wealth; the
much greater part of wealth is a country’s physical capital stock and (though it isn’t
included in the ofﬁcial national income accounts) its “human capital”—the eco-
nomically valuable skills of its population. Thus, if a country borrows abroad but
uses the proceeds of that borrowing to increase its physical and human capital, the
foreign borrowing is of less concern than when a country borrows purely to ﬁnance
current consumption spending. Unfortunately, the deterioration of the U.S. net
foreign asset position doesn’t appear to have been accompanied by any signiﬁcant
increase in the rates of physical investment or human capital formation in the
United States. In that respect, the continued high rate of U.S. borrowing abroad is
worrisome but unlikely to create an immediate crisis.

5.2 Goods Market Equilibrium in an Open Economy
We are now ready to investigate the economic forces that determine international
trade and borrowing. In the remainder of this chapter we demonstrate that a
country’s current account balance and foreign lending are closely linked to its
domestic spending and production decisions. Understanding these links first
requires developing the open-economy version of the goods market equilibrium
condition.

Chapter 5 Saving and Investment in the Open Economy 177
In Chapter 4 we derived the goods market equilibrium condition for a closed
economy. We showed that this condition can be expressed either as desired national
saving equals desired investment or, equivalently, as the aggregate supply of goods
equals the aggregate demand for goods. With some modiﬁcation, we can use these
same two conditions to describe goods market equilibrium in an open economy.
Let’s begin with the open-economy version of the condition that desired
national saving equals desired investment. In Chapter 2 we derived the national
income accounting identity (Eq. 2.9):
(5.2)
Equation (5.2) is a version of the uses-of-saving identity. It states that national
saving, has two uses: (1) to increase the nation’s stock of capital by funding
investment, and (2) to increase the nation’s stock of net foreign assets by lending
to foreigners (recall that the current account balance, equals the amount of
funds that the country has available for net foreign lending). Equation (5.2) also
reminds us that (assuming no net unilateral transfers) the current account, is
the sum of net exports, and net factor payments from abroad, 
Because Eq. (5.2) is an identity , it must always hold (by deﬁnition). For the econ-
omy to be in goods market equilibrium, actual national saving and investment must
also equal their desired levels. If actual and desired levels are equal, Eq. (5.2) becomes
(5.3)
where and represent desired national saving and desired investment, respec-
tively. Equation (5.3) is the goods market equilibrium condition for an open econ-
omy, in which the current account balance, equals net lending to foreigners, or
ﬁnancial outﬂows.
6
Hence Eq. (5.3) states that in goods market equilibrium in an open
economy, the desired amount of national saving, , must equal the desired amount of
domestic investment, , plus the amount lent abroad, . Note that the closed-econo-
my equilibrium condition is a special case of Eq. (5.3), with .
In general, the majority of net factor payments, are determined by past
investments and aren’t much affected by current macroeconomic developments. If
for simplicity we assume that net factor payments, are zero, the current
account equals net exports and the goods market equilibrium condition, Eq. (5.3),
becomes
(5.4)
Equation (5.4) is the form of the goods market equilibrium condition that we
will work with. Under the assumption that net factor payments are zero, we can
refer to the term interchangeably as net exports or as the current account
balance.
As for the closed economy, we can also write the goods market equilibrium con-
dition for the open economy in terms of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand
for goods. In an open economy, where net exports, are part of the aggregate
demand for goods, this alternative condition for goods market equilibrium is

Throughout this section and for the remainder of this book, we ignore unilateral transfers of capital,
so the capital account balance equals zero. The ﬁnancial account balance therefore has the same size
but the opposite sign as the current account balance.

where is output, is desired consumption spending, and is government pur-
chases. This way of writing the goods market equilibrium condition is equivalent
to the condition in Eq. (5.4).
7
We can rewrite Eq. (5.5) as
(5.6)
Equation (5.6) states that in goods market equilibrium the amount of net exports
a country sends abroad equals the country’s total output (gross domestic product),
less total desired spending by domestic residents, Total spending
by domestic residents is called absorption. Thus Eq. (5.6) states that an economy
in which output exceeds absorption will send goods abroad ( ) and have a
current account surplus and that an economy that absorbs more than it produces
will be a net importer ( ), with a current account deﬁcit.
5.3 Saving and Investment in a Small Open Economy
To show how saving and investment are related to international trade and
lending, we first present the case of a small open economy. A small open econ-
omy is an economy that is too small to affect the world real interest rate. The
world real interest rate is the real interest rate that prevails in the international
capital market—that is, the market in which individuals, businesses, and gov-
ernments borrow and lend across national borders. Because changes in saving
and investment in the small open economy aren’t large enough to affect the
world real interest rate, this interest rate is fixed in our analysis, which is a con-
venient simplification. Later in this chapter we consider the case of an open
economy, such as the U.S. economy, that is large enough to affect the world real
interest rate.
As with the closed economy, we can describe the goods market equilibrium
in a small open economy by using the saving–investment diagram. The important
new assumption that we make is that residents of the economy can borrow or
lend in the international capital market at the (expected) world real interest rate,
which for now we assume is ﬁxed. If the world real interest rate is the
domestic real interest rate must be as well, as no domestic borrower with
access to the international capital market would pay more than to borrow, and
no domestic saver with access to the international capital market would accept
less than to lend.
8
Figure 5.2 shows the saving and investment curves for a small open economy.
In a closed economy, goods market equilibrium would be represented by point 
the intersection of the curves. The equilibrium real interest rate in the closed econ-
omy would be 4% (per year), and national saving and investment would be $3 bil-
lion (per year). In an open economy, however, desired national saving need not

To see that Eq. (5.5) is equivalent to Eq. (5.4), subtract from both sides of Eq. (5.5) to obtain
The left side of this equation equals desired national saving, so it is the
same as Eq. (5.4).
8
For simplicity, we ignore factors such as differences in risk or taxes that might cause the domestic
real interest rate to differ from the world rate. We also assume that there are no legal barriers to inter-
national borrowing and lending (when they exist, such barriers are referred to as capital controls).

equal desired investment. If the small open economy faces a ﬁxed world real inter-
est rate, higher than 4%, desired national saving will be greater than desired
investment. For example, if is 6%, desired national saving is $5 billion and desired
investment is $1 billion, so desired national saving exceeds desired investment by 
$4 billion.
Can the economy be in equilibrium when desired national saving exceeds
desired investment by $4 billion? In a closed economy it couldn’t. The excess saving
would have no place to go, and the real interest rate would have to fall to bring
desired saving and desired investment into balance. However, in the open econo-
my the excess $4 billion of saving can be used to buy foreign assets. This ﬁnancial
outﬂow uses up the excess national saving so that there is no disequilibrium.
Instead, the goods market is in equilibrium with desired national saving of $5
billion, desired investment of $1 billion, and net foreign lending of $4 billion (see
Eq. 5.4 and recall that net exports, and net foreign lending are the same).
Alternatively, suppose that the world real interest rate, is 2% instead of
6%. As Fig. 5.3 shows, in this case desired national saving is $1 billion and desired
investment is $5 billion so that desired investment exceeds desired saving by $4 bil-
lion. Now ﬁrms desiring to invest will have to borrow $4 billion in the international
capital market. Is this also a goods market equilibrium? Yes it is, because desired
national saving ($1 billion) again equals desired investment ($5 billion) plus net for-
eign lending (minus $4 billion). Indeed, a small open economy can achieve goods
market equilibrium for any value of the world real interest rate. All that is required
is that net foreign lending equal the difference between the country’s desired
national saving and its desired investment.
A more detailed version of the example illustrated in Figs. 5.2 and 5.3 is pre-
sented in Table 5.3. As shown in the top panel, we assume that in this small coun-
try gross domestic product, is ﬁxed at its full-employment value of $20 billion Y,

shows that, if 6%, desired consumption, , is $11 billion (row 2) and that
desired investment, is $1 billion (row 3). With at $11 billion, desired national 
saving, is $5 billion (row 5). Desired net foreign lending, 
is $4 billion (row 7)—the same result illustrated in Fig. 5.2.
If 2%, as in Fig. 5.3, column (1) of Table 5.3 shows that desired national
saving is $1 billion (row 5) and that desired investment is $5 billion (row 3). Thus
desired foreign lending, equals billion (row 7)—that is, foreign bor-
rowing totals $4 billion. Again, the result is the same as illustrated in Fig. 5.3.
An advantage of working through the numerical example in Table 5.3 is that
we can also use it to demonstrate how the goods market equilibrium, which we’ve
been interpreting in terms of desired saving and investment, can be interpreted in
terms of output and absorption. Suppose again that 6%, giving a desired
consumption, of $11 billion and a desired investment, of $1 billion. Govern-
ment purchases, are ﬁxed at $4 billion. Thus when is 6%, desired absorption
(the desired spending by domestic residents), totals $16 billion (row
4, column 3).
In goods market equilibrium a country’s net exports—the net quantity of goods
and services that it sends abroad—equal gross domestic product, minus desired
absorption (Eq. 5.6). When is 6%, is $20 billion and desired absorption is $16 bil-
lion so that net exports, are $4 billion. Net exports of $4 billion imply that the
country is lending $4 billion abroad, as shown in Fig. 5.2. If the world real interest rate
drops to 2%, desired absorption rises (because people want to consume more and
invest more) from $16 billion to $24 billion (row 4, column 1). Because in this case
absorption ($24 billion) exceeds domestic production ($20 billion), the country has to
import goods and services from abroad ( billion). Note that desired net
imports of $4 billion imply net foreign borrowing of $4 billion, as shown in Fig. 5.3.
The Effects of Economic Shocks in a Small Open Economy
The saving–investment diagram can be used to determine the effects of various
types of economic disturbances in a small open economy. Brieﬂy, any change that
increases desired national saving relative to desired investment at a given world real
interest rate will increase net foreign lending, the current account balance, and net
exports, which are all equivalent under our assumption that net factor payments
from abroad and net unilateral transfers are zero. A decline in desired national
saving relative to desired investment reduces those quantities. Let’s look at two
examples that arise frequently in various countries.
Example 1: A Temporary Adverse Supply Shock. Suppose that a small open economy is
hit with a severe drought—an adverse supply shock—that temporarily lowers
output. The effects of the drought on the nation’s saving, investment, and current
account are shown in Fig. 5.4. The initial saving and investment curves are and ,
respectively. For the world real interest rate, initial net foreign lending
(equivalently, net exports or the current account balance) is distance 
The drought brings with it a temporary decline in income. A drop in current
income causes people to reduce their saving at any prevailing real interest rate, so
the saving curve shifts left, from to . If the supply shock is temporary, as we
have assumed, the expected future marginal product of capital is unchanged. As a
result, desired investment at any real interest rate is unchanged, and the investment
curve does not shift. The world real interest rate is given and does not change.

In the new equilibrium, net foreign lending and the current account have
shrunk to distance The current account shrinks because the country saves less
and thus is not able to lend abroad as much as before.
In this example, we assumed that the country started with a current account
surplus, which is reduced by the drought. If, instead, the country had begun with
a current account deﬁcit, the drought would have made the deﬁcit larger. In either
case the drought reduces (in the algebraic sense) net foreign lending and the cur-
rent account balance.
Example 2: An Increase in the Expected Future Marginal Product of Capital.
Suppose that technological innovations increase the expected future marginal
product, of current capital investment. The effects on a small open
economy are shown in Fig. 5.5. Again, the initial national saving and investment
curves are and , respectively, so that the initial current account surplus
equals distance 
An increase in the raises the capital stock that domestic ﬁrms desire to
hold so that desired investment rises at every real interest rate. Thus the investment
curve shifts to the right, from to . The current account and net foreign lending
shrink to length Why does the current account fall? Because building capital
has become more proﬁtable in the home country, more of the country’s output is
absorbed by domestic investment, leaving less to send abroad.

A possibility that we have neglected so far is that technological innovations also cause savers to
expect a higher future income, which would reduce current saving at every level of the world real
interest rate. A leftward shift of the saving curve would further reduce the current account balance.
This effect would only reinforce the effect on the country’s current account of the rightward shift of
the investment curve, so for simplicity we continue to ignore this potential change in desired saving.

5.4 Saving and Investment in Large Open Economies
Although the model of a small open economy facing a ﬁxed real interest rate is
appropriate for studying many of the countries in the world, it isn’t the right model
to use for analyzing the world’s major developed economies. The problem is that
signiﬁcant changes in the saving and investment patterns of a major economy can
and do affect the world real interest rate, which violates the assumption made for
the small open economy that the world real interest rate is ﬁxed. Fortunately, we
can readily adapt the analysis of the small open economy to the case of a large open
economy, that is, an economy large enough to affect the world real interest rate.
To begin, let’s think of the world as comprising only two large economies: (1) the
home, or domestic economy , and (2) the foreign economy (representing the economies
of the rest of the world combined). Figure 5.6 shows the saving–investment diagram
that applies to this case. Figure 5.6(a) shows the saving curve, and the investment
curve, of the home economy. Figure 5.6(b) displays the saving curve, , and the
investment curve, , of the foreign economy. These saving and investment curves
are just like those for the small open economy.
Instead of taking the world real interest rate as given, as we did in the model
of a small open economy, we determine the world real interest rate within the
model for a large open economy. What determines the value of the world real
interest rate? Remember that for the closed economy the real interest rate was set
by the condition that the amount that savers want to lend must equal the amount
that investors want to borrow. Analogously, in the case of two large open
economies, the world real interest rate will be such that desired international lending by
one country equals desired international borrowing by the other country.

Figure 5.6
The determination of the world real interest rate with two large open economies
The equilibrium world real interest rate is the real interest rate at which desired international lending by one country equals
desired international borrowing by the other country. In the ﬁgure, when the world real interest rate is 5%, desired interna-
tional lending by the home country is $200 billion ($400 billion desired national saving less $200 billion desired investment,
or distance ), which equals the foreign country’s desired international borrowing of $200 billion ($700 billion desired
investment less $500 billion desired national saving, or distance ). Thus 5% is the equilibrium world real interest rate.
Equivalently, when the interest rate is 5%, the current account surplus of the home country equals the current account deﬁcit
of the foreign country (both are $200 billion).

To illustrate the determination of the equilibrium world real interest rate, we return
to Fig. 5.6. Suppose, arbitrarily , that the world real interest rate, is 6%. Does this rate
result in a goods market equilibrium? Figure 5.6(a) shows that, at a 6% real interest rate,
in the home country desired national saving is $450 billion and desired investment is
$150 billion. Because desired national saving exceeds desired investment by $300 billion,
the amount that the home country would like to lend abroad is $300 billion.
To ﬁnd how much the foreign country wants to borrow, we turn to Fig. 5.6(b).
When the real interest rate is 6%, desired national saving is $550 billion and desired
investment is $650 billion in the foreign country. Thus at a 6% real interest rate the
foreign country wants to borrow $100 billion ($650 billion less $550 billion) in the
international capital market. Because this amount is less than the $300 billion the
home country wants to lend, 6% is not the real interest rate that is consistent with
equilibrium in the international capital market.
At a real interest rate of 6%, desired international lending exceeds desired
international borrowing, so the equilibrium world real interest rate must be less
than 6%. Let’s try a real interest rate of 5%. Figure 5.6(a) shows that at that interest
rate desired national saving is $400 billion and desired investment is $200 billion in

the home country, so the home country wants to lend $200 billion abroad. In 
Fig. 5.6(b), when the real interest rate is 5%, desired national saving in the foreign
country is $500 billion and desired investment is $700 billion, so the foreign coun-
try’s desired international borrowing is $200 billion. At a 5% real interest rate,
desired international borrowing and desired international lending are equal (both
are $200 billion), so the equilibrium world real interest rate is 5% in this example.
Graphically, the home country’s desired lending when equals 5% is dis-
tance in Fig. 5.6(a), and the foreign country’s desired borrowing is distance 
in Fig. 5.6(b). Because distance equals distance desired international lend-
ing and borrowing are equal when the world real interest rate is 5%.
We deﬁned international equilibrium in terms of desired international lending
and borrowing. Equivalently, we can deﬁne equilibrium in terms of international
ﬂows of goods and services. The amount the lending country desires to lend (distance
in Fig. 5.6a) is the same as its current account surplus. The amount the borrowing
country wants to borrow (distance in Fig. 5.6b) equals its current account deﬁcit.
Thus saying that desired international lending must equal desired international bor-
rowing is the same as saying that the desired net outﬂow of goods and services from
the lending country (its current account surplus) must equal the desired net inﬂow of
goods and services to the borrowing country (its current account deﬁcit).
In summary, for a large open economy the equilibrium world real interest rate
is the rate at which the desired international lending by one country equals the
desired international borrowing of the other country. Equivalently, it is the real
interest rate at which the lending country’s current account surplus equals the
borrowing country’s current account deﬁcit.
Unlike the situation in a small open economy, for large open economies the
world real interest rate is not ﬁxed but will change when desired national saving or
desired investment changes in either country. Generally, any factor that increases
desired international lending relative to desired international borrowing at the initial
world real interest rate causes the world real interest rate to fall. Similarly, a change
that reduces desired international lending relative to desired international borrowing
at the initial world real interest rate will cause the world real interest rate to rise.

The Impact of Globalization on the U.S. Economy
Section 5.1, “Balance of Payments Accounting,” showed how the international
balance of payments accounts keep track of international trade and investment.
These accounts reveal that the world’s economies have become increasingly
interdependent, as the volume of trade in goods and services has increased and
as people in one country have increased their investment in other countries.
This globalization is not without its consequences, and some people have argued
that the United States needs to rein in the degree of globalization, restricting
trade or international investment. To evaluate such proposals, we need to exam-
ine the facts about globalization, including how it has affected U.S. trade with
other countries, how trade in services has changed, and how international
investment has been altered.

186 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
To begin, let’s look at how U.S. trade with other countries has changed
over time. If we examine exports of goods and services as a percentage of
our GDP, we can see the relative importance of exports in the economy; simi-
larly for imports. Figure 5.7 shows both statistics from 1929 to 2008. After
World War II, both exports and imports rose gradually relative to GDP until the
mid 1980s, when both began growing more rapidly. From the mid 1980s to
2006, imports have generally outpaced exports, thereby leading to a trade
deficit that peaked at about 5.5% of GDP. The recession that began in 2007
led to a reduction in imports relative to GDP, reducing the trade deficit to just
over 3%.
In addition to increased trade in goods and services, investors have also
increased their investments in foreign countries over the past 30 years. As
we saw in Figure 5.1 in the Application “The United States as International
Debtor,” p. 175, ownership of foreign assets by U.S. investors has increased
rapidly, and that ownership of U.S. assets by foreign investors has increased
even more rapidly, so that the United States has gone from being a net inter-
national creditor 30 years ago (with U.S. ownership of foreign assets exceeding
foreign ownership of U.S. assets) to a net international debtor (with U.S.
ownership of foreign assets being less than foreign ownership of U.S. assets)
today.
As the U.S. economy has become more interdependent with other
economies, there have been some costs and complaints. Increased openness

means that jobs in some sectors of the U.S. economy may be eliminated, as a par-
ticular good is produced by workers in another country. Often workers complain
that they have lost their jobs to foreign workers. And there have been instances,
widely reported in the U.S. business press, in which a company shuts down a
facility in the United States and opens one to do the same work in a foreign
country. There are costs in foreign countries as well. In the fourth quarter of
2008, U.S. GDP declined about 6% because of the financial crisis and recession.
But countries in Asia that produced many goods that they export to the United
States suffered declines of 12% and more in their GDPs, as U.S. demand for
their products declined dramatically.
Some people conclude that international trade destroys jobs. But interna-
tional trade also creates jobs. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has
noted, “Directly, trade creates jobs in the United States by expanding the
potential market for U.S. goods and services. . . . Trade also creates jobs indi-
rectly, in a variety of ways” including allowing firms to obtain cheaper or
higher quality inputs to production and giving consumers greater variety of
goods and services at lower prices.
10
Bernanke also recognized why people
sometimes are fearful of increased trade: “... those who lose jobs for trade-
related reasons are not necessarily the same people who get the new jobs cre-
ated by trade. Trade, like other factors resulting in structural change, can have
noticeable effects on the mix of jobs across industries, skill levels, and loca-
tions.” But Bernanke also noted that the loss of jobs because of trade is very
small relative to the loss of jobs every year for other reasons, so that trade is
not a major factor in job loss.
In recent years, U.S. business ﬁrms have hired foreign workers in the business
services industry. For example, call centers for customer service related to com-
puters have been established in countries such as India, in part because those coun-
tries have educated workers who are ﬂuent in English and because technological
improvements have reduced the costs of international phone calls, thus allowing
customers in the United States to call technicians in another country. This type of
trade in services has become widespread, and some critics have objected to U.S.
ﬁrms “moving jobs abroad.”
However, the U.S. economy is the world leader in providing business ser-
vices to other countries, not the other way around. Some U.S. politicians have
proposed prohibiting U.S. companies from establishing call centers abroad, but
this suggestion seems to ignore that the United States is the world leader in
providing such services to other countries. U.S. exports of business services far
exceed our imports of business services. So, if the United States ended all
imports of business services, and other countries did the same, U.S. net exports
would fall and the U.S. economy would be harmed, not helped, in terms of the
short-term loss of jobs.

Recent Trends in the U.S. Current Account Deficit
The United States has a very large current account deﬁcit, as discussed in section 5.1,
“Balance of Payments Accounting.” But the current account deﬁcit began to shrink in
2007 and 2008, thanks to the U.S. recession, which reduced demand for imported goods.
Figure 5.8 shows how the current account balance has changed since 1960.
The ﬁgure shows that the current account balance was generally positive in the
1960s, bounced up and down around zero in the 1970s, and then fell sharply to
about of GDP by the mid 1980s. In the second half of the 1980s, the current
account balance improved, becoming positive again in 1991. From 1991 to 2005, it
deteriorated markedly, falling to of GDP by the end of 2005. The housing
downturn of 2006 and the recession that began in 2007 helped the current account
balance improve to about of GDP by mid 2008, as U.S. consumers bought
fewer imported goods and services than before. When the ﬁnancial crisis hit in late
2008, U.S. imports fell sharply and the current account balance improved to about
of GDP by the ﬁrst quarter of 2009.
Economists have tried to explain why the current account balance declined
steadily from 1991 to 2005. They developed four explanations: (1) a decline in
demand by foreigners; (2) improved opportunities for international investment; 
(3) the rise in oil prices; (4) increased saving by developing countries.

The ﬁrst explanation for the increased current account deﬁcit was a slowdown
in demand by foreigners, especially those in Japan and Europe. Economic growth
in those areas was slow, and they ran current account surpluses. Both Japan and
Germany increased their saving rates as the ratio of older workers to younger
workers rose. As a result, they spent less (and thus imported fewer U.S. goods) and
saved more, and the increased saving was often invested in the United States.
A second explanation for the increased U.S. current account deﬁcit from 1991
to 2005 has to do with increased opportunities for international investment. U.S.
investors sought to diversify their portfolios internationally, and foreign investors
increasingly sought to invest in the United States. As foreigners perceived a rise
in the return to U.S. investments in the second half of the 1990s, they invested
more in the United States. The result was a U.S. capital and ﬁnancial account sur-
plus and a current account deﬁcit. The increased return on U.S. equity increased
the wealth of U.S. households and led to a lower personal saving rate and higher
consumption spending. As Fig. 5.9 shows, the United States now ﬁnds itself with
a net international investment position of about of one year’s GDP. (For
more on this subject, see the Application “The United States as International
Debtor,” p. 175.)
A third reason for the widening current account deﬁcit in recent years is the rise
in oil prices. The average price of a barrel of crude oil increased twelve-fold from
1998 to 2008, and the United States imports far more oil than it exports. As a result,
the value of U.S. net exports of oil decreased sharply, thereby increasing the U.S.
current account deﬁcit by 1% of GDP in the early 2000s, and by as much as 2.5% of
GDP in 2008, as Fig. 5.10 shows.

M05_ABEL4529_07_SE_C05.QXD  12/11/09  1:01 AM  Page 189
190 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
The ﬁnal reason for the increase in the current account deﬁcit from 1998 to
2005 was a change in the saving behavior of developing countries.
12
Developing
nations that had borrowed from abroad in past decades began lending abroad,
especially to the United States. In part, this change in behavior occurred as a result
of past ﬁnancial crises, such as Mexico experienced in 1994 and the countries of
East Asia experienced in 1997–1998. Those crises were exacerbated by the fact
that those countries had borrowed substantially from foreign countries. To prevent
such crises from happening again, the countries increased their saving, built up
foreign exchange reserves, and became net lenders to foreign countries instead of
net borrowers.
A factor that may or may not be responsible for the increase in the current
account deficit is the increase in the U.S. government budget deficit. As dis-
cussed in the Application “The Twin Deficits” on p. 193, both the current account
deficit and government budget deficits grew sharply in early 2000s; however,
they moved in opposite directions in late 1990s. In addition, countries such as
Germany and Japan have had government budget deficits that are much larger
(as a share of GDP) than that in the United States, but those countries ran large
current account surpluses. Therefore, the large U.S. government budget deficit
may be a cause of the large current account deficit, but the evidence on this
issue is mixed.

5.5 Fiscal Policy and the Current Account
During the 1980s and 1990s the United States often had both large government
budget deﬁcits and large current account deﬁcits. Are these two phenomena relat-
ed? Many economists and other commentators argue that they are, suggesting that
in fact the budget deﬁcit is the primary cause of the current account deﬁcit. Those
supporting this view often use the phrase “twin deﬁcits” to convey the idea that the
government budget deﬁcit and the current account deﬁcit are closely linked. Not all
economists agree with this interpretation, however; some argue that the two
deﬁcits are largely unrelated. In this section we brieﬂy discuss what the theory has
to say about this issue and then turn to the evidence.
The Critical Factor: The Response of National Saving
In theory, the issue of whether there is a link between the government budget
deﬁcit and the current account deﬁcit revolves around the following proposition:
An increase in the government budget deﬁcit will raise the current account deﬁcit only if the
increase in the budget deﬁcit reduces desired national saving.
Let’s ﬁrst look at why the link to national saving is crucial. Figure 5.11 shows
the case of the small open economy. The world real interest rate is ﬁxed at We
draw the initial saving and investment curves, and so that, at the world real
interest rate, the country is running a current account surplus, represented by
distance Now suppose that the government budget deﬁcit rises. For simplici-
ty, we assume throughout this section that the change in ﬁscal policy doesn’t affect
the tax treatment of investment so that the investment curve doesn’t shift. Hence as
Fig. 5.11 shows, the government deﬁcit increase will change the current account
balance only if it affects desired national saving.
The usual claim made by supporters of the twin-deﬁcits idea is that an increase
in the government budget deﬁcit reduces desired national saving. If it does, the
increase in the government deﬁcit shifts the desired national saving curve to the
left, from to . The country still has a current account surplus, now equal to dis-
tance but it is less than the original surplus, 
We conclude that in a small open economy an increase in the government
budget deﬁcit reduces the current account balance by the same amount that it
reduces desired national saving. By reducing saving, the increased budget deﬁcit
reduces the amount that domestic residents want to lend abroad at the world real
interest rate, thus lowering financial outflows. Equivalently, reduced national
saving means that a greater part of domestic output is absorbed at home; with less
output to send abroad, the country’s current account balance falls. Similar results
hold for the large open economy (you are asked to work out this case in Analytical
Problem 4 at the end of the chapter).
The Government Budget Deficit and National Saving
Let’s now turn to the link between the budget deﬁcit and saving and consider two
cases: a budget deﬁcit arising from an increase in government purchases and a
deﬁcit rising from a cut in taxes.
A Deﬁcit Caused by Increased Government Purchases. Suppose that the source of the
government budget deﬁcit is a temporary increase in government purchases,

perhaps owing to a military buildup. In this case there is no controversy: Recall
(Chapter 4) that, with output, held constant at its full-employment level, an
increase in government purchases, directly reduces desired national saving,
13,14
Because economists agree that a deﬁcit owing to increased
government purchases reduces desired national saving, they also agree that a deﬁcit
resulting from increased government purchases reduces the nation’s current account
balance.
A Deficit Resulting from a Tax Cut. Suppose instead that the government
budget deficit is the result of a cut in current taxes, with current and planned
future government purchases unchanged. With government purchases, 
unchanged and with output, held constant at its full-employment level, the tax
cut will cause desired national saving, to fall only if it causes
desired consumption, to rise.
Will a tax cut cause people to consume more? As we discussed in Chapter 4,
believers in the Ricardian equivalence proposition argue that a lump-sum tax
change (with current and future government purchases held constant) won’t affect
desired consumption or desired national saving. These economists point out that
a cut in taxes today forces the government to borrow more to pay for its current

Because the increase in government purchases also means that taxes may be raised in the future,
lowering consumers’ expected future income, desired consumption, may fall. However, because
the increase in is temporary so that the future tax increase need not be too large, this drop in 
should not completely offset the effect of increased on desired national saving.

purchases; when this extra borrowing plus interest is repaid in the future, future
taxes will have to rise. Thus, although a tax cut raises consumers’ current after-tax
incomes, the tax cut creates the need for higher future taxes and lowers the after-
tax incomes that consumers can expect to receive in the future. Overall, according
to this argument, a tax cut doesn’t beneﬁt consumers and thus won’t increase
their desired consumption.
If the Ricardian equivalence proposition is true, a budget deﬁcit resulting from
a tax cut will have no effect on the current account because it doesn’t affect desired
national saving. However, as we noted in Chapter 4, many economists argue that—
despite the logic of Ricardian equivalence—in practice many consumers do
respond to a current tax cut by consuming more. For example, consumers simply
may not understand that a higher deﬁcit today makes higher taxes tomorrow more
likely. If for any reason consumers do respond to a tax cut by consuming more, the
deﬁcit resulting from a tax cut will reduce national saving and thus also will reduce
the current account balance.

APPLICATION
The Twin Deficits
The relationship between the U.S. government budget and the U.S. current account
for the period 1960–2008 is illustrated in Fig. 5.12. This ﬁgure shows government
purchases and net government income (taxes less transfers and interest) for the
Federal government alone as well as for the combined Federal, state, and local gov-
ernments, all measured as a percentage of GDP. Our discussion of the current
account balance as the excess of national saving over investment leads us to focus
on the broadest level of government, which includes state and local government in
addition to the Federal government. We also present data on the purchases and net
income of the Federal government alone because Federal budget deﬁcits and sur-
pluses are often the focus of public attention. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5.12,
much of the movement in purchases and net income of the combined Federal,
state, and local government reﬂects movement in the corresponding components of
the Federal budget.
The excess of government purchases over net income is the government budget
deﬁcit, shown in pink.
15
Negative values of the current account balance indicate a
current account deﬁcit, also shown in pink. During the 1960s, the combined gov-
ernment sector in the United States ran a surplus, even though the Federal govern-
ment ran modest budget deﬁcits in the late 1960s. At the same time, the current
account showed a modest surplus. The largest deﬁcits—both government and cur-
rent account—occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. Between 1979 and 1983, the
budget deﬁcit of the combined government sector increased from less than 0.1% of
GDP to almost 5% of GDP, corresponding to an increase in the Federal budget
deﬁcit from about 0.5% of GDP to approximately 5% of GDP over the same period
15
Government purchases are current expenditures minus transfer payments and interest. Thus gov-
ernment investment is not included in government purchases. The budget deﬁcit is the current
deﬁcit; see Chapter 15 for a further discussion of this concept.

of time. This growth in the government budget deﬁcit reﬂected a decline in net
government income (particularly important in this respect were the tax cuts phased
in following the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981), but military spending also
increased. The current account, which was in surplus in 1981, fell to a deﬁcit of 2.5%
of GDP in 1984. Both the government budget deﬁcit and the current account deﬁcit
remained large throughout the 1980s and the ﬁrst half of the 1990s.
16
The apparently close relationship between the U.S. government budget deﬁcit
and the current account deﬁcit in the 1980s and the ﬁrst half of the 1990s represents
evidence in favor of the twin-deﬁcits idea that budget deﬁcits cause current account
deﬁcits. Because the rise in budget deﬁcits primarily reﬂected tax cuts (or increas-
es in transfers and interest payments, which reduced net government income)
rather than increased government purchases, this behavior of the two deﬁcits also
seems to contradict the Ricardian equivalence proposition, which says that tax cuts
should have no effect on saving or the current account.
Even though the U.S. experience during the 1980s and ﬁrst half of the 1990s
seems to conﬁrm the link between government budget and the current account,
evidence from other episodes is less supportive of the twin-deﬁcits idea. For exam-
ple, the United States simultaneously ran large government budget deﬁcits and
large current account surpluses in the periods around World War I and II (compare
Figs. 1.5 and 1.6). Another situation in which the twin-deﬁcits idea failed to hold
16
During 1991 the current account deﬁcit was less than 0.1% of GDP . This improvement was largely
the result of one-time unilateral transfers to the United States from allies to help defray the costs of
the Persian Gulf War.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. The balance of payments accounts consist of the current
account and the capital and ﬁnancial account. The cur-
rent account records trade in currently produced goods
and services, income from abroad, and transfers
between countries. The capital and ﬁnancial account,
which consists of the capital account and the ﬁnancial
account, records trade in existing assets, both real and
ﬁnancial. In the United States the capital account, which
records unilateral transfers of assets, is very small.
2. In the current account, exports of goods and services,
receipts of income from abroad, and unilateral transfers
received from abroad count as credit (plus) items.
Imports of goods and services, payments of income to
foreigners holding assets or working in the home coun-
try , and unilateral transfers sent abroad are debit (minus)
items in the current account. The current account bal-
ance, equals the value of credit items less debit
items in the current account. Ignoring net factor pay-
ments and net unilateral transfers, the current account
CA,
balance is the same as net exports, The capital and
ﬁnancial account balance, is the value of assets
sold to foreigners (ﬁnancial inﬂows) minus the value of
assets purchased from foreigners (ﬁnancial outﬂows)
plus net unilateral transfers of assets.
3. In each period, except for measurement errors, the
current account balance, and the capital and
financial account balance, must sum to zero.
The reason is that any international transaction
amounts to a swap of goods, services, or assets
between countries; the two sides of the swap
always have offsetting effects on the sum of the
current account and capital and financial account
balances.
4. In an open economy, goods market equilibrium
requires that the desired amount of national saving
equal the desired amount of domestic investment
plus the amount the country lends abroad. Equiva-
lently, net exports must equal the country’s output

occurred in 1975. A one-time Federal tax rebate contributed to a large (4.0% of
GDP for the combined government; 4.2% of GDP for the Federal government)
government budget deﬁcit, yet the U.S. current account balance rose noticeably in
1975, as Fig. 5.12 shows. In the late 1990s, the Federal government budget and the
combined government budget were both in surplus, yet the U.S. current account
balance remained deeply in deﬁcit because private saving fell and investment
rose as a share of GDP at the same time. And at the end of 2008 and early 2009, the
government budget deﬁcit grew substantially as the government increased spend-
ing to stimulate the economy, but the current account deﬁcit fell considerably as
consumers cut back on their purchases of imported goods and services.
The evidence from other countries on the relationship between government budget
and current account deﬁcits is also mixed. For example, Germany’s budget deﬁcit and
current account deﬁcit both increased in the early 1990s following the reuniﬁcation of
Germany . This behavior is consistent with the twin-deﬁcits idea. During the mid 1980s,
however, Canada and Italy both ran government budget deﬁcits that were considerably
larger than those in the United States (as a percentage of GDP), without experiencing
severe current account problems. Because of the lack of clear evidence, a good deal
of disagreement persists among economists about the relationship between govern-
ment budget deﬁcits and the current account.
17
We can say for sure (because it
is implied by the uses-of-saving identity , Eq. 2.11) that if an increase in the government
budget deﬁcit is not offset by an equal increase in private saving, the result must be a
decline in domestic investment, a rise in the current account deﬁcit, or both.

5. A small open economy faces a ﬁxed real interest rate
in the international capital market. In goods market
equilibrium in a small open economy, national saving
and investment equal their desired levels at the pre-
vailing world real interest rate; foreign lending, net
exports, and the current account all equal the excess
of national saving over investment. Any factor that
increases desired national saving or reduces desired
investment at the world real interest rate will increase
the small open economy’s foreign lending (equiva-
lently, its current account balance).
6. The levels of saving and investment of a large open
economy affect the world real interest rate. In a
model of two large open economies, the equilibrium
real interest rate in the international capital market is
the rate at which desired international lending by
one country equals desired international borrowing
by the other country. Equivalently, it is the rate at
which the lending country’s current account surplus
equals the borrowing country’s current account
deficit. Any factor that increases desired national
saving or reduces desired investment at the initial
interest rate for either large country will increase the
supply of international loans relative to the demand
and cause the world real interest rate to fall.
7. According to the twin-deﬁcits hypothesis, the large
U.S. government budget deﬁcits of the 1980s and the
first half of the 1990s helped cause the sharply
increased U.S. current account deﬁcits of that period.
Whether budget deficits cause current account
deﬁcits is the subject of disagreement. In theory, and
if we assume no change in the tax treatment of
investment, an increase in the government budget
deﬁcit will raise the current account deﬁcit only if it
reduces national saving. Economists generally agree
that an increase in the budget deﬁcit caused by a tem-
porary increase in government purchases will reduce
national saving, but whether an increase in the
budget deﬁcit caused by a tax cut reduces national
saving remains controversial.

an increase in current taxes, if Ricardian equiva-

■ Anything that increases desired investment at the pre-
vailing real interest rate shifts the investment curve to
the right. Factors that shift the investment curve to the
right (see Summary table 6, p. 130) include an increase
in the expected future marginal product of capital,
and a decrease in the effective tax rate on capital.
■ An increase in desired national saving shifts the saving
curve to the right and raises net exports and the current
account balance, Equivalently, an increase in
desired national saving raises the country’s net foreign
lending, which equals its capital and ﬁnancial account
deﬁcit, Similarly, an increase in desired invest-
ment shifts the investment curve to the right and
lowers net exports, the current account balance, net
foreign lending, and the capital and ﬁnancial account
deﬁcit.
■ An increase in the world real interest rate, raises
the horizontal line in the diagram. Because an
increase in the world real interest rate increases
national saving and reduces investment, it raises net
foreign lending, net exports, the current account sur-
plus, and the capital and ﬁnancial account deﬁcit.

Diagram Elements
■ The figure consists of two saving–investment
diagrams, one for the home country and one for
the foreign country (representing the rest of the
world).
■ The world real interest rate, measured on
the vertical axis, is the real interest rate faced
by both countries in the international capital
market.
■ The saving and investment curves in the home coun-
try ( and ) and in the foreign country ( and )
are the same as the saving and investment curves
presented before (Key Diagram 3, p. 142, and Key
Diagram 4).
Analysis
■ This case differs from the case of the small open
economy (Key Diagram 4) in that the world real
interest rate, is determined within the model,
not given.
■ Goods market equilibrium for large open
economies requires that the desired international
lending of one country equal the desired inter-
national borrowing of the other. Equivalently,
because a country’s international lending equals its
current account balance, goods market equilib-
rium requires that one country’s current account
surplus equal the other country’s current account
deficit.

■ The world real interest rate adjusts to achieve goods
market equilibrium. In the diagram is the equi-
librium world real interest rate, because at that
interest rate the home country’s desired interna-
tional lending (its desired national saving less
desired investment, or distance ) equals the for-
eign country’s desired international borrowing (its
desired investment less desired national saving, or
distance ).
Factors That Shift the Curves
■ The saving and investment curves in the two coun-
tries are shifted by the same factors as in Key Dia-
gram 3, p. 142, and Key Diagram 4.
■ The world real interest rate changes when desired
national saving or desired investment changes in
either country. Any change that increases desired
international lending relative to desired internation-
al borrowing at the initial world real interest rate
will cause the world real interest rate to fall to
restore equilibrium in the international capital
market. Changes that increase desired international
lending relative to desired international borrowing
include an increase in desired national saving or a
decrease in desired investment in either country.
Similarly, a decrease in desired national saving or
an increase in desired investment in either country
reduces desired international lending relative to
desired international borrowing and raises the world
real interest rate.

REVIEW QUESTIONS
All review questions are available in 
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. List the categories of credit items and debit items that
appear in a country’s current account. What is the
current account balance? What is the relationship
between the current account balance and net
exports?
2. What is the key difference that determines whether an
international transaction appears in the current account
or the capital and ﬁnancial account?
3. A U.S. publisher sells $200 worth of books to a resident of
Brazil. By itself, this item is a credit item in the U.S. cur-
rent account. Describe some offsetting transactions that
could ensure that the U.S. current account and the capi-
tal and ﬁnancial account balances would continue to
sum to zero.
4. How do a country’s current account and capital and
ﬁnancial account balances affect its net foreign assets? If
country A has greater net foreign assets per citizen than
does country B, is country A necessarily better off than
country B?
5. Explain why, in a small open economy, (a) national
saving does not have to equal investment, and (b) output
does not have to equal absorption.
6. Generally, what types of changes in desired saving
and desired investment lead to large current acco-
unt deﬁcits in a small open economy? What factors
lead to these changes in desired saving and desired
investment?
7. In a world with two large open economies, what deter-
mines the world real interest rate? What relationship
between the current accounts of the two countries is sat-
isﬁed when the world real interest rate is at its equilibri-
um value?
8. How does an increase in desired national saving in a
large open economy affect the world real interest rate?
How does an increase in desired investment affect it?
Why do changes in desired saving or investment in large
open economies affect the world real interest rate but
changes in desired saving or investment in small open
economies do not?
9. Under what circumstances will an increase in the gov-
ernment budget deﬁcit affect the current account bal-

between them?
The goods market equilibrium condition in an open
economy holds that desired national saving, , must
equal desired investment, plus the amount lent
abroad. The amount lent abroad equals the current
account balance, which (if we assume that net factor
payments and unilateral transfers are zero) also equals
net exports, NX.

Assuming that unilateral transfers equal zero,
find net exports, the current account balance, the
capital and financial account balance, the official set-
tlements balance, and the statistical discrepancy.
(Note: The increase in home reserve assets of 30 is
included in the increase in the home country’s own-
ership of assets abroad of 160, and the increase in
foreign reserve assets of 35 is included in the
increase in foreign ownership of assets in the home
country of 200.)

uct) is $25 billion, government purchases are $6 bil-
lion, and net factor payments from abroad are zero.
Desired consumption and desired investment are relat-
ed to the world real interest rate in the following
manner:
In the foreign country the following relationships hold:

tional capital market? What are the equilibrium
values of consumption, national saving, investment,
and the current account balance in each country?
b. Suppose that in the home country government pur-
chases increase by 50 to 325. Taxes also increase by
50 to keep the deﬁcit from growing. What is the
new equilibrium interest rate in the international
capital market? What are the new equilibrium
values of consumption, national saving, investment,
and the current account balance in each country?

ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. Explain how each of the following transactions would
enter the U.S. balance of payments accounts. Discuss
only the transactions described. Do not be concerned
with possible offsetting transactions.
a. The U.S. government sells F–16 ﬁghter planes to a
foreign government.
b. A London bank sells yen to, and buys dollars from,
a Swiss bank.
c. The Federal Reserve sells yen to, and buys dollars
from, a Swiss bank.
d. A New York bank receives the interest on its loans to
Brazil.
e. A U.S. collector buys some ancient artifacts from a
collection in Egypt.
f. A U.S. oil company buys insurance from a Canadian
insurance company to insure its oil rigs in the Gulf
of Mexico.
g. A U.S. company borrows from a British bank.
2. For each transaction described in Analytical Problem 1
that by itself changes the sum of the U.S. current
account balance, and the U.S. capital and ﬁnancial
account balance, give an example of an offsetting
transaction that would leave unchanged.
3. A large country imposes capital controls that prohibit
foreign borrowing and lending by domestic residents.
Analyze the effects on the country’s current account bal-
ance, national saving, and investment, and on domestic
and world real interest rates. Assume that, before the
capital controls were imposed, the large country was
running a capital and ﬁnancial account surplus.
4. The text showed, for a small open economy, that an
increase in the government budget deﬁcit raises the
current account deﬁcit only if it affects desired nation-
al saving in the home country. Show that this result is
also true for a large open economy. Then assume that
an increase in the government budget deﬁcit does affect
desired national saving in the home country. What
effects will the increased budget deﬁcit have on the for-
eign country’s current account, investment in both
countries, and the world real interest rate?
5. How would each of the following affect national
saving, investment, the current account balance, and
the real interest rate in a large open economy?
CA + KFA
KFA,
CA,
Chapter 5 Saving and Investment in the Open Economy 201
a. An increase in the domestic willingness to save
(which raises desired national saving at any given
real interest rate).
b. An increase in the willingness of foreigners to save.
c. A temporary increase in foreign government purchases.
d. An increase in foreign taxes (consider both the case
in which Ricardian equivalence holds and the case
in which it doesn’t hold).
6. Analyze the effects on a large open economy of a tempo-
rary adverse supply shock that hits only the foreign econ-
omy. Discuss the impact on the home country’s national
saving, investment, and current account balance—and on
the world real interest rate. How does your answer differ
if the adverse supply shock is worldwide?
7. The chief economic advisor of a small open economy
makes the following announcement: “We have good
news and bad news: The good news is that we have
just had a temporary beneﬁcial productivity shock that
will increase output; the bad news is that the increase in
output and income will lead domestic consumers to buy
more imported goods, and our current account balance
will fall.” Analyze this statement, taking as given that a
beneﬁcial productivity shock has indeed occurred.
8. The world is made up of only two large countries: East-
land and Westland. Westland is running a large current
account deﬁcit and often appeals to Eastland for help in
reducing this current account deﬁcit. Currently the gov-
ernment of Eastland purchases $10 billion of goods and
services, and all of these goods and services are produced
in Eastland. The ﬁnance minister of Eastland proposes that
the government purchase half of its goods from Westland.
Speciﬁcally, the government of Eastland will continue to
purchase $10 billion of goods, but $5 billion will be from
Eastland and $5 billion will be from Westland. The ﬁnance
minister gives the following rationale: “Both countries pro-
duce identical goods so it does not really matter to us
which country produced the goods we purchase. More-
over, this change in purchasing policy will help reduce
Westland’s large current account deﬁcit.” What are the
effects of this change in purchasing policy on the current
account balance in each country and on the world real
interest rate? (Hint: What happens to net exports by the
private sector in each country after the government of
Eastland changes its purchasing policy?)
nation ran current account surpluses and capital and
ﬁnancial account deﬁcits, acquiring foreign bonds. It
now owns $500,000 of foreign bonds. The interest rate
on these bonds is 5% per year. The residents of the
island nation consume $1,025,000 per year. What are
the values of investment, national saving, the current
account balance, the capital and ﬁnancial account bal-
ance, net exports, GDP , and GNP in this country?

WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. A popular measure of a country’s “openness” to inter-
national trade is an index computed as the sum of the
country’s exports and imports divided by its GDP.
Calculate and graph the openness index for the United
States using quarterly data since 1947. What has been
the postwar trend? Can you think of any factors that
might help explain this trend? (Hint: Be careful with
the data, as some databases record imports with a neg-
ative sign and then add them to exports to get net
exports. If that is the case with your data, take the
absolute value of imports before adding it to exports,
because we are interested in the total volume of trade,
not the balance of trade.)
2. Using quarterly data since 1961, graph output and
absorption (both in real terms) in the same ﬁgure. In
202 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
another ﬁgure, graph real investment, national saving,
and the current account balance for the same period.
(Use real GNP, which includes net factor payments, as
the measure of output and/or income.) What is the rela-
tionship between the two ﬁgures?
3. Using quarterly data since 1960, graph the following four
series, expressing each as a percent of GDP: exports of
goods (sometimes called merchandise), exports of ser-
vices, imports of goods (sometimes called merchandise),
and imports of services. What trends do you notice in
U.S. exports and imports of goods and services? When
computing the percentage of GDP , you should note that
quarterly data on exports and imports often are not
expressed at annual rates, but the data on GDP are
expressed at annual rates; if this is the case with your
data, multiply your data on imports and exports by 4 to
get the appropriate ratio relative to GDP .

CHAPTER 6
Long-Run Economic
Growth
A nation’s ability to provide improving standards of living for its people depends
crucially on its long-run rate of economic growth. Over a long period of time, even
an apparently small difference in the rate of economic growth can translate into a
large difference in the income of the average person.
Compare, for example, the historical experiences of Australia and Japan. In
1870 real GDP per person was more than four times as large in Australia as in
Japan, as the data on national growth performances in Table 6.1 show. Australia’s
economy didn’t stand still after 1870. Over the next 136 years, Australian real GDP
per person grew by 1.5% per year so that by 2006 the real income of the average
Australian was more than seven times as great as it had been in 1870. However,
during the same period Japanese real GDP per person grew at a rate of 2.5% per
year, reaching a level in 2006 that was more than thirty times as large as it had been
in 1870.
The Japanese growth rate of 2.5% per year may not seem dramatically greater
than the Australian growth rate of 1.5% per year. Yet by 1990 Japan, which had been
far poorer than Australia a century earlier, had surpassed its Paciﬁc neighbor in per
capita GDP by a margin of 10%. However, in the 1990s, sluggish growth in Japan
allowed Australia to retake the lead by 1998. Other, similar comparisons can be
drawn from Table 6.1; compare, for example, the long-term growth performance of
the United Kingdom against that of Canada or Sweden. Note, however, that even
those countries that grew relatively slowly have dramatically increased their
output per person during the past century and a quarter.
Although the comparisons highlighted by Table 6.1 span a long period of time,
a change in the rate of economic growth can have important effects over even a
decade or two. For example, since about 1973 the United States and other indus-
trialized countries have experienced a sustained slowdown in their rates of growth.
Between 1947 and 1973, total (not per capita) real GDP in the United States grew by
4.0% per year, but between 1973 and 2008 U.S. real GDP grew by only 2.9% per
year. To appreciate the signiﬁcance of this slowdown, imagine that the 1947–1973
growth trend had continued—that is, suppose that real GDP in the United States
had continued to grow at 4.0% per year instead of at the 2.9% per year rate actual-
ly achieved. Then in 2008 the U.S. real GDP would have been more than 45%
higher than its actual value—a bonus of about $6.6 trillion, or $21,700 per person (in
2008 dollars).

204 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
No one understands completely why economies grow, and no one has a magic
formula for inducing rapid growth. Indeed, if such a formula existed, there would
be no poor nations. Nevertheless, economists have gained useful insights about the
growth process. In this chapter we identify the forces that determine the growth
rate of an economy over long periods of time and examine various policies that
governments may use to try to inﬂuence the rate of growth. Once again, saving and
investment decisions play a central role in the analysis. Along with changes in
productivity, the rates at which a nation saves and invests—and thus the rate at
which it accumulates capital goods—are important factors in determining the stan-
dard of living that the nation’s people can attain.
6.1 The Sources of Economic Growth
An economy’s output of goods and services depends on the quantities of available
inputs, such as capital and labor, and on the productivity of those inputs. The rela-
tionship between output and inputs is described by the production function, intro-
duced in Chapter 3:
(6.1)
Equation (6.1) relates total output, Y, to the economy’s use of capital, K, and labor,
N, and to productivity, A.
If inputs and productivity are constant, the production function states that
output also will be constant—there will be no economic growth. For the quantity of
output to grow, either the quantity of inputs must grow or productivity must
improve, or both. The relationship between the rate of output growth and the rates
of input growth and productivity growth is

where
In Eq. (6.2) the elasticity of output with respect to capital, a
K
, is the percentage
increase in output resulting from a 1% increase in the capital stock, and the elas-
ticity of output with respect to labor, a
N
, is the percentage increase in output result-
ing from a 1% increase in the amount of labor used. The elasticities a
K
and a
N
both
are numbers between 0 and 1 that must be estimated from historical data.
1
Equation (6.2), called the growth accounting equation, is the production func-
tion (Eq. 6.1) written in growth rate form. Some examples will be helpful for under-
standing the growth accounting equation.
Suppose that a new invention allows ﬁrms to produce 10% more output for the
same amount of capital and labor. In terms of the production function, Eq. (6.1), for
constant capital and labor inputs, a 10% increase in productivity, A, raises output,
Y, by 10%. Similarly, from the growth accounting equation, Eq. (6.2), if productivi-
ty growth, ΔA/A, equals 10% and capital and labor growth are zero, output growth,
ΔY/Y, will be 10%. Thus the production function and the growth accounting equa-
tion give the same result, as they should.
Now suppose that ﬁrms’ investments cause the economy’s capital stock to rise by
10% (ΔK/K = 10%) while labor input and productivity remain unchanged. What will
happen to output? The production function shows that, if the capital stock grows,
output will increase. However, because of the diminishing marginal productivity of
capital (see Chapter 3), the extra capital will be less productive than that used previ-
ously, so the increase in output will be less than 10%. Diminishing marginal produc-
tivity of capital is the reason that the growth rate of capital, ΔK/K, is multiplied by a
factor less than 1 in the growth accounting equation. For the United States this factor,
a
K
, the elasticity of output with respect to capital, is about 0.3. Thus the growth account-
ing equation, Eq. (6.2), indicates that a 10% increase in the capital stock, with labor and
productivity held constant, will increase U.S. output by about 3%, or 0.3 × 10%.
Similarly, the elasticity of output with respect to labor, a
N
, is about 0.7 in the
United States. Thus, according to Eq. (6.2), a 10% increase in the amount of labor
used (ΔN/N = 10%), with no change in capital or productivity, will raise U.S. output
by about 7%, or 0.7 × 10%.

206 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Growth Accounting
According to Eq. (6.2), output growth, ΔY/Y, can be broken into three parts:
1. that resulting from productivity growth, ΔA/A,
2. that resulting from increased capital inputs, a
K
ΔK/K, and
3. that resulting from increased labor inputs, a
N
ΔN/N.
Growth accounting measures empirically the relative importance of these
three sources of output growth. A typical growth accounting analysis involves the
following four steps (see Table 6.2 for a summary and numerical example):
■ Step 1. Obtain measures of the growth rates of output, ΔY/Y, capital, ΔK/K,
and labor, ΔN/N, for the economy over any period of time. In the calculation
of growth rates for capital and labor, more sophisticated analyses make ad-
justments for changing quality as well as quantity of inputs. For example, to
obtain a quality-adjusted measure of N, an hour of work by a skilled worker
is counted as more labor than an hour of work by an unskilled worker.
Similarly, to obtain a quality-adjusted measure of K, a machine that can turn
ﬁfty bolts per minute is treated as being more capital than a machine that can
turn only thirty bolts per minute.
■ Step 2. Estimate values for the elasticities a
K
and a
N
from historical data. Keep
in mind the estimates for the United States of 0.3 for a
K
and 0.7 for a
N
.

Step 1. Obtain measures of output growth, capital growth, and labor growth over the period to be studied.

■ Step 3. Calculate the contribution of capital to economic growth as a
K
ΔK/K
and the contribution of labor to economic growth as a
N
ΔN/N.
■ Step 4. The part of economic growth assignable to neither capital growth nor
labor growth is attributed to improvements in total factor productivity, A. The
rate of productivity change, ΔA/A, is calculated from the formula
which is the growth accounting equation, Eq. (6.2), rewritten with ΔA/A on the left
side. Thus the growth accounting technique treats productivity change as a resid-
ual—that is, the portion of growth not otherwise explained.

Growth Accounting and the Productivity Slowdown. What does growth
accounting say about the sources of U.S. economic growth? Among the best-
known research using the growth accounting framework was done at the
Brookings Institution by Edward Denison. Table 6.3 summarizes Denison’s
ﬁndings for the period 1929–1982 and provides more recent data from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics covering the period 1982–2008.
The last entry in column (4) shows that, over the 1929–1982 period, output grew
at an average rate of 2.92% per year. According to Denison’s measurements (column
4), the growth of labor accounted for output growth of 1.34% per year. The growth of
labor in turn resulted primarily from an increase in population, an increase in the per-
centage of the population in the labor force, and higher educational levels, which
raised workers’ skills. (Offsetting these trends to a degree was a decline in the
number of hours worked per person.) According to Denison, the growth of the cap-
ital stock accounted for output growth of 0.56% per year. So, taken together, labor and
capital growth contributed 1.90% to the annual growth rate of output.

The growth accounting method for calculating productivity growth is similar to the method we used to
ﬁnd productivity growth in Section 3.1, where we also determined productivity growth as the part of
output growth not explained by increases in capital and labor. The differences are that growth account-
ing uses the growth accounting equation, which is the production function in growth rate form, instead
of using the production function directly, as we did in Chapter 3; and growth accounting analyses usu-
ally adjust measures of capital and labor for changes in quality, which we did not do in Chapter 3.

208 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
The difference between total growth (2.92%) and the amount of growth attrib-
uted to capital and labor growth (1.90%) is 1.02%. By the growth accounting
method, this remaining 1.02% per year of growth is attributed to increases in pro-
ductivity. Thus, according to Denison, increased quantities of factors of production
and improvements in the effectiveness with which those factors were used both
played an important role in U.S. growth after 1929.
Data for three shorter periods are given in columns (1)–(3) of Table 6.3. This
breakdown highlights a striking conclusion: Productivity growth during 1973–1982
was negative (fourth entry in column 3). In other words, Denison estimated that
any combination of capital and labor would have produced less output in 1982
than it could have in 1973! (See the Application “The Post–1973 Slowdown in Pro-
ductivity Growth,” for various hypotheses to explain this drop in productivity.)
Comparing columns (2) and (3) reveals that the decline in U.S. productivity growth
between the 1948–1973 and 1973–1982 periods of 1.80 percentage points (1.53
minus –0.27) accounts for the bulk of the overall slowdown in output growth
between those periods of 2.15 percentage points (3.70 minus 1.55).
The slowdown in productivity growth after 1973 reported by Denison was
conﬁrmed by other studies, both for the United States and for other industrialized
countries. This slowdown generated widespread concern, because a sustained
reduction in the rate of productivity growth would have an adverse effect on future
real wages and living standards. In addition, to the extent that future Social Secu-
rity beneﬁts will be paid by taxing the wage income of future workers, a long-term
productivity slowdown would threaten the future of the Social Security system. But
will the productivity slowdown continue? To shed light on this question, the ﬁnal
column of Table 6.3 extends Denison’s calculations by adding 26 years of more
recent data. During the period 1982–2008, productivity grew at an average annual
rate of 1.01%. Although the return to a positive rate of productivity growth was a
welcome development, the 1.01% growth rate was only about two-thirds of the
productivity growth rate seen during the 25-year period preceding the 1973 slow-
down. But beginning in the second half of the 1990s, productivity growth
increased. From 1995 to 2008, it has averaged 1.38% per year, which is only 0.15 per-
centage points lower than it was from 1948 to 1973. For more details, see the Appli-
cation “The Recent Surge in U.S. Productivity Growth,” p. 211.
APPLICATION
The Post–1973 Slowdown in Productivity Growth
We have seen in Table 6.3 that productivity in the United States grew much more
slowly after 1973 than in the quarter-century preceding 1973. Indeed, productivity
growth was negative during the period 1973–1982. What caused productivity per-
formance to deteriorate so sharply? In this application we discuss some alternative
explanations, including possible measurement problems, deterioration in the legal
and human environment, the effects of high oil prices, and the information tech-
nology revolution.
Measurement
Interestingly , several economists have suggested that the productivity slowdown really
isn’t a genuine economic problem. Instead, they argue, the slowdown is an illusion, the
result of measurement problems that have overstated the extent of the decline.

Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon, “The Productivity Slowdown, Measurement Issues, and the
Explosion of Computer Power,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1988:2, pp. 347–420.
The key issue in productivity measurement is whether the ofﬁcial output statistics
adequately capture changes in quality . Consider the case of a ﬁrm producing personal
computers that, using unchanged quantities of capital and labor, makes the same
number of computers this year as last year. However, this year’s computers are of
much higher quality than last year’s because they are faster and have more memory.
The ﬁrm’s output this year has a greater real economic value than last year’s output, so
the true productivity of the ﬁrm’s capital and labor has risen over the year, even though
the ﬁrm produces the same number of computers as before. However, if statisticians
measuring the ﬁrm’s output counted only the number of computers produced and
failed to adjust for quality change, they would miss this improvement in productivity .
Similar issues arise in the construction of price indexes; see ”In Touch with Data and
Research: Does CPI Inﬂation Overstate Increases in the Cost of Living?”, p. 46.
In fact, ofﬁcial output measures do try to account for quality improvements—
for example, by counting a faster computer as contributing more to output than a
slower model. However, measuring quality change is difﬁcult, and to the extent
that improvements are not fully accounted for in the data, productivity growth will
be underestimated. One study suggested that measurement problems could
explain at most one-third of the reported post–1973 slowdown.
4
Thus, the produc-
tivity slowdown is not, for the most part, simply a measurement problem.
The Legal and Human Environment
In his growth accounting study , Edward Denison didn’t stop at reporting the decline
in productivity growth but went on to offer some explanations for the decline. One
explanation given by Denison for the negative productivity growth during
1973–1982 is the change in what he called the legal and human environment, which
includes several diverse factors. For example, since 1973 a cleaner environment and
worker safety and health have been emphasized. To the extent that capital and
labor are devoted to these goals, measured output and productivity will decline.
5
The Oil Price Explanation
A popular explanation for the productivity slowdown is the large increase in energy
prices that followed the OPEC oil embargo in 1973. The idea is that, as companies
responded to high energy prices by using less energy, the amount of output they
could produce with the same amount of capital and labor declined, reducing pro-
ductivity . What makes this explanation plausible is not only that the timing is right—
the productivity decline appears to have begun in earnest in about 1973—but that,
unlike several of the other explanations, the oil price story explains why all major
industrial countries, not just the United States, experienced a slowdown. However,
5
Of course, the reduction in measured productivity caused by reducing pollution or increasing
worker safety is not in any way an argument against pursuing these goals. The proper criterion for
evaluating proposed environmental regulations, for example, is whether the beneﬁts to society of the
regulations, in terms of cleaner air or water, exceed the costs they will impose. For a discussion of the
problems of accounting for environmental quality when measuring output, see "In Touch with Data
and Research: Natural Resources, the Environment, and the National Income Accounts," p.29.

210 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
proponents of the oil price explanation face the problem of explaining why produc-
tivity growth did not resurge when oil prices fell in real terms in the 1980s.
The Beginning of a New Industrial Revolution?
In an article titled simply “1974,” Jeremy Greenwood of the University of Penn-
sylvania and Mehmet Yorukoglu of the Central Bank of Turkey
6
argue that the
slowdown in productivity after 1973 may have resulted from the onset of the infor-
mation technology (IT) revolution. The development and commercial implemen-
tation of new information technologies required a substantial period of learning by
both the developers of the new technology and the skilled workers who would
work with the technology. During the learning process, productivity was tem-
porarily depressed as developers and workers groped toward developing more
powerful technologies and operating those technologies more efﬁciently. To sup-
port their view that productivity was depressed following the introduction of a
new range of technologies, Greenwood and Yorukoglu present data showing that
productivity in Great Britain fell in the late eighteenth century during the early part
of the Industrial Revolution in that country. In the United States, productivity fell
in the 1830s as the young country was beginning its industrialization.
This view of the post–1973 productivity slowdown offers an optimistic prospect
for the future. In the previous industrial revolutions examined by Greenwood and
Yorukoglu, the revolutionary ideas eventually paid off in terms of very large increas-
es in productivity after a few decades of learning. If the productivity slowdown in the
1970s did, in fact, result from the IT revolution, then we should see increases in
productivity growth in the not-too-distant future. In fact, proponents of this view
suggest that the improved productivity growth in the 1990s reﬂects the IT revolution.
Additional support for this hypothesis is provided by Bart Hobijn of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and Boyan Jovanovic of New York University ,
7
who argue
that the stock market fell during the 1970s because the IT revolution would eventual-
ly beneﬁt new ﬁrms that had not yet been formed, at the expense of existing ﬁrms then
traded on the stock market. As these new ﬁrms were born, ﬂourished, and became
traded on the stock market in the 1980s and 1990s, the stock market boomed.
Of course, only time will tell whether predicted gains in productivity will
materialize and whether the rise in the stock market in the 1990s will continue in
the twenty-ﬁrst century.
Conclusion
The problem involved in explaining the post–1973 slowdown in productivity growth
may not be a lack of reasonable explanations but too many. We should not dismiss
the possibility that there was no single cause of the slowdown but that many factors
contributed to it. Unfortunately , if there are multiple explanations for the slowdown,
no single policy action by itself is likely to rev up the productivity engine. Fortu-
nately , however, since the mid-1990s, productivity growth has increased substantially ,
as we discuss in the Application “The Recent Surge in U.S. Productivity Growth.”

APPLICATION
The Recent Surge in U.S. Productivity Growth
Our discussion of productivity growth in Table 6.3 showed that productivity growth
slowed in the period from 1973 to 1982 but returned to a faster pace after 1982. In the
late 1990s, labor productivity grew far more rapidly than it had for the preceding
20 years. In the past few years, labor productivity (output per hour in the nonfarm
business sector) and total factor productivity (A in Equation 6.1) have continued to
grow, and economists have developed new explanations for that growth.
If we examine the levels of productivity shown in Fig. 6.1, we see that both
labor productivity and total factor productivity have grown fairly steadily in the
past 26 years, since bottoming out in 1982. Labor productivity has grown some-
what faster than total factor productivity. (Note that both of the variables are
indexed to have a value of 100 in year 2000. So, the levels of the indexes themselves
have no inherent meaning.)
Figure 6.2 shows the growth rates of the productivity measures and illus-
trates a widening gap between labor productivity growth and total factor pro-
ductivity growth since 1995. To understand the relationship between the
growth rates of total factor productivity and average labor productivity, recall

Empirically, the elasticity of output with respect to capital, a

, plus the elastic-
ity of output with respect to labor, a

, equals one, so that a

. Substituting
1 - a

in Eq. (6.2) yields
Finally, subtracting the growth rate of labor, ΔN/N, from both sides of this
equation yields
(6.3)
Notice that the left-hand side of Eq. (6.3), , is the growth rate of Y/N, 
that is, it is the growth rate of average labor productivity. The amount of capital per 
unit of labor, K/N, grows at the rate . Thus, Eq. (6.3) states that the growth 
rate of average labor productivity equals the growth rate of total factor productivity ,
ΔA/A, plus a
K
times the growth rate of capital per unit of labor. As shown in Fig. 6.2,
because capital per unit of labor generally grows, so that , the
growth rate of average labor productivity is generally higher than the growth rate of
total factor productivity. Figure 6.2 also shows that excess of average labor productivi-
ty growth over total factor productivity growth has been unusually large since 1995,
which is consistent with a higher growth rate of capital per unit of labor during this time.

Chapter 6 Long-Run Economic Growth 213
The rise in labor productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s has mostly been
attributed to the revolution in information and communications technologies (ICT).
Recently, research by economists has challenged the view that the growth in U.S. labor
productivity was largely the result of increased ICT growth. One reason that economists
have looked more carefully at this issue is that many other countries also invested heav-
ily in ICT but did not reap the same labor productivity rewards as in the United States.
Why did the United States see an appreciable gain in labor productivity from ICT,
but Europe did not? Researchers have discovered a number of reasons.
8
European
ﬁrms are subject to substantially more government regulations than U.S. ﬁrms, and
consequently are slower to adopt new technologies. Government-owned ﬁrms in
Europe often stiﬂe innovation because of a lack of competitive pressure. Government
regulations have also prevented the existence in Europe of “big box” retail outlets that
efﬁciently provide goods to consumers, as in the United States. Shortages of workers
in Europe who have the skills needed to use the new technologies have also slowed
their adoption. In the United States, adaptable capital markets and research universi-
ties that foster innovation have contributed to the adoption of new technologies.
Another puzzle that has occupied researchers studying productivity is that,
although economists attribute productivity gains to ICT investment, the timing is
strange: There appears to be a long lag between investment in ICT and a rise in pro-
ductivity. U.S. ﬁrms invested heavily in computers in the 1980s, but productivity
growth did not rise very much—not nearly as much as it has since 1995. In addi-
tion, ICT investment fell sharply in 2000, but productivity growth has remained
strong. As we discussed in the Application “The Post–1973 Slowdown in Produc-
tivity Growth,” p. 208, this weak link in timing between ICT investment and pro-
ductivity improvements may arise because the use of ICT requires more than just
buying computers—it takes research and development expenditures, reorganiza-
tion of the ﬁrm, and training of workers. These activities, which economists call
investment in intangible capital, take time and may temporarily cause a ﬁrm’s
output to decline rather than to rise. Thus, investment in intangible capital can help
explain the lag between increases in ICT investment and productivity growth.
Is the recent increase in productivity unique in U.S. history? Not at all. In fact,
researchers have identiﬁed three similar periods in our past: 1873 to 1890, following the
Civil War; 1917 to 1927, following World War I; and 1948 to 1973, following World War
II.
9
In each of these episodes, productivity improvements led to a substantial increase
in the U.S. standard of living. New technologies included steam power, railroad trans-
portation, and communication by telegraph in the late 1800s; electriﬁcation in factories
after World War I; and the transistor after World War II. Each of these periods was char-
acterized not only by new technology but also by changes in how business ﬁrms were
organized and by investments in workers (education and training).
The lesson from history is that it is not just the development of new technology
that has improved productivity since 1995, but also the ability of U.S. ﬁrms to
adapt and use that technology, with investments in intangible capital and reorga-
nization to take advantage of what the new technologies offer.

214 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
6.2 Growth Dynamics: The Solow Model
Although growth accounting provides useful information about the sources of
economic growth, it doesn’t completely explain a country’s growth performance.
Because growth accounting takes the economy’s rates of input growth as given, it
can’t explain why capital and labor grow at the rates that they do. The growth of
the capital stock in particular is the result of the myriad saving and investment
decisions of households and ﬁrms. By taking the growth of the capital stock as
given, the growth accounting method leaves out an important part of the story.
In this section we take a closer look at the dynamics of economic growth, or how
the growth process evolves over time. In doing so, we drop the assumption made in
Chapter 3 that the capital stock is ﬁxed and study the factors that cause the econo-
my’s stock of capital to grow. Our analysis is based on a famous model of economic
growth developed in the late 1950s by Nobel laureate Robert Solow
10
of MIT, a
model that has become the basic framework for most subsequent research on growth.
Besides clarifying how capital accumulation and economic growth are interrelated,
the Solow model is useful for examining two basic questions about growth:
1. What is the relationship between a nation’s long-run standard of living and
fundamental factors such as its saving rate, its population growth rate, and its
rate of technical progress?
2. How does a nation’s rate of economic growth evolve over time? Will eco-
nomic growth stabilize, accelerate, or stop?
Setup of the Solow Model
The Solow model examines an economy as it evolves over time. To analyze the
effects of labor force growth as well as changes in capital, we assume that the pop-
ulation is growing and that at any particular time a ﬁxed share of the population is
of working age. For any year, t,
We assume that the population and work force both grow at ﬁxed rate n. So, if n =
0.05, the number of workers in any year is 5% greater than in the previous year.
At the beginning of each year, t, the economy has available a capital stock, K
t
. (We
demonstrate shortly how this capital stock is determined.) During each year, t, cap-
ital, K
t
, and labor, N
t
, are used to produce the economy’s total output, Y
t
. Part of the
output produced each year is invested in new capital or in replacing worn-out capi-
tal. We further assume that the economy is closed and that there are no government
purchases,
11
so the uninvested part of output is consumed by the population. If
 C
t
= consumption in year t,
 I
t
= gross (total) investment in year t, and
 Y
t
= output produced in year t,
N
t
= the number of workers available.
11
Analytical Problem 3 at the end of this chapter adds government purchases to the model.
10
The original article is Robert M. Solow, “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth,”
Quarterly Journal of Economics, February 1956, pp. 65–94.
M06_ABEL4529_07_SE_C06.QXD  12/11/09  3:09 AM  Page 214
the relationship among consumption, output, and investment in each year is
(6.4)
Equation (6.4) states that the uninvested part of the economy’s output is consumed.
Because the population and the labor force are growing in this economy, focus-
ing on output, consumption, and the capital stock per worker is convenient. Hence
we use the following notation:
The capital stock per worker, k
t
, is also called the capital–labor ratio. An important
goal of the model is to understand how output per worker, consumption per
worker, and the capital–labor ratio change over time.
12
The Per-Worker Production Function. In general, the amount of output that
can be produced by speciﬁc quantities of inputs is determined by the production
function. Until now we have written the production function as a relationship
between total output, Y, and the total quantities of capital and labor inputs, K and
N. However, we can also write the production function in per-worker terms as
(6.5)
Equation (6.5) indicates that, in each year t, output per worker, y
t
, depends on
the amount of available capital per worker, k
t
.
13
Here we use a lower case f instead
of an upper case F for the production function to emphasize that the measurement
of output and capital is in per-worker terms. For the time being we focus on the role
of the capital stock in the growth process by assuming no productivity growth and
thus leaving the productivity term out of the production function, Eq. (6.5).
14
We
bring productivity growth back into the model later.
The per-worker production function is graphed in Fig. 6.3. The capital–labor
ratio (the amount of capital per worker), k
t
, is measured on the horizontal axis, and
output per worker, y
t
, is measured on the vertical axis. The production function
slopes upward from left to right because an increase in the amount of capital per
worker allows each worker to produce more output. As with the standard pro-
duction function, the bowed shape of the per-worker production function reﬂects

13
To write the production function in the form of Eq. (6.5) requires the assumption of constant returns
to scale, which means that an equal percentage increase in both capital and labor inputs results in the
same percentage increase in total output. So, for example, with constant returns to scale, a 10% increase
in both capital and labor raises output by 10%. In terms of the growth accounting equation, Eq. (6.2),
constant returns to scale requires that a
K
+ a
N
= 1. See Analytical Problem 6 at the end of this chapter.
12
For purposes of analysis, discussing output and consumption per worker is more convenient than
discussing output and consumption per member of the population as a whole. Under the assumption
that the labor force is a ﬁxed fraction of the population and is fully employed, anything we say about
the growth rate of output or consumption per worker also will be true of the growth rate of output or
consumption per member of the population.
14
More precisely, we set the total factor productivity term A equal to 1.

216 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
the diminishing marginal productivity of capital. Thus when the capital–labor
ratio is already high, an increase in the capital–labor ratio has a relatively small
effect on output per worker.
Steady States. One of the most striking conclusions obtained from the Solow
model is that in the absence of productivity growth the economy reaches a steady
state in the long run. A steady state is a situation in which the economy’s output
per worker, consumption per worker, and capital stock per worker are constant—
that is, in the steady state, y
t
, c
t
, and k
t
don’t change over time.
15
To explain how
the Solow model works, we ﬁrst examine the characteristics of a steady state and
then discuss how the economy might attain it.
Let’s begin by looking at investment in a steady state. In general, gross (total)
investment in year t, I
t
, is devoted to two purposes: (1) replacing worn-out or
depreciated capital, and (2) expanding the size of the capital stock. If d is the capi-
tal depreciation rate, or the fraction of capital that wears out each year, the total
amount of depreciation in year t is dK
t
. The amount by which the capital stock is
increased is net investment. What is net investment in a steady state? Because cap-
ital per worker, K
t
/N
t
, is constant in a steady state, the total capital stock grows at
the same rate as the labor force—that is, at rate n. Net investment is therefore nK
t
in a steady state.
16
To obtain steady-state gross investment, we add steady-state net
investment nK
t
and depreciation dK
t
:
(6.6) I
t
= (n + d)K
t 
(in a steady state).
15
Note that if output, consumption, and capital per worker are constant, then total output, consump-
tion, and capital all are growing at rate n, the rate of growth of the work force.

To obtain steady-state consumption (output less investment), we substitute
Eq. (6.6) into Eq. (6.4):
(6.7)
Equation (6.7) measures consumption, output, and capital as economywide
totals rather than in per-worker terms. To put them in per-worker terms, we divide
both sides of Eq. (6.7) by the number of workers, N

) and obtain
(6.8)
Equation (6.8) shows the relationship between consumption per worker, c, and
the capital–labor ratio, k, in the steady state. Because consumption per worker and
the capital–labor ratio are constant in the steady state, we dropped the time sub-
scripts, t.
Equation (6.8) shows that an increase in the steady-state capital–labor ratio, k, has
two opposing effects on steady-state consumption per worker, c. First, an increase in
the steady-state capital–labor ratio raises the amount of output each worker can pro-
duce, f(k). Second, an increase in the steady-state capital–labor ratio increases the
amount of output per worker that must be devoted to investment, (n + d)k. More
goods devoted to investment leaves fewer goods to consume.
Figure 6.4 shows the trade-off between these two effects. In Fig. 6.4(a) different
possible values of the steady-state capital–labor ratio, k, are measured on the hori-
zontal axis. The curve is the per-worker production function, y = f(k), as in Fig. 6.3.
The straight line shows steady-state investment per worker, (n + d)k. Equation (6.8)
indicates that steady-state consumption per worker, c, equals the height of the
curve, f(k), minus the height of the straight line, (n + d)k. Thus consumption per
worker is the height of the shaded area.
The relationship between consumption per worker and the capital–labor ratio
in the steady state is shown more explicitly in Fig. 6.4(b). For each value of the
steady-state capital–labor ratio, k, steady-state consumption, c, is the difference
between the production function and investment in Fig. 6.4(a). Note that, starting
from low and medium values of k (values less than k
G
in Fig. 6.4(b)), increases in the
steady-state capital–labor ratio lead to greater steady-state consumption per
worker. The level of the capital–labor ratio that maximizes consumption per worker
in the steady state, shown as k
G
in Fig. 6.4, is known as the Golden Rule capi-
tal–labor ratio, so-called because it maximizes the economic welfare of future gen-
erations.
17
However, for high values of k (values greater than the Golden Rule capital–
labor ratio, k
G
), increases in the steady-state capital–labor ratio actually result in
lower steady-state consumption per worker because so much investment is needed
to maintain the high level of capital per worker. In the extreme case, where k = k
max
in Fig. 6.4, all output has to be devoted to replacing and expanding the capital
stock, with nothing left to consume!
Policymakers often try to improve long-run living standards with policies
aimed at increasing the capital–labor ratio by stimulating saving and investment.

The relationship of
consumption per

capital–labor ratio in
the steady state
(a) For each value of the
capital–labor ratio, k,
steady-state output per
worker, y, is given by the
per-worker production
function, f(k). Steady-state
investment per worker,
(n + d)k, is a straight line
with slope n + d. Steady-
state consumption per
worker, c, is the differ-
ence between output per
worker and investment
per worker (the peach-
shaded area). For exam-
ple, if the capital–labor
ratio is k
G
, steady-state
consumption per worker
is c
G
. (b) For each value
of the steady-state capi-
tal–labor ratio, k, steady-
state consumption per
worker, c, is derived in
(a) as the difference
between output per
worker and investment
per worker. Thus the
shaded area (peach) in
(b) corresponds to the
shaded area in (a). Note
that, starting from a low
value of the capital–labor
ratio, an increase in the
capital–labor ratio raises
steady-state consumption
per worker. However,
starting from a capital–
labor ratio greater than
the Golden Rule level, k
G
,
an increase in the capi-
tal–labor ratio actually
lowers consumption per
worker. When the capi-
tal–labor ratio equals
k
max
, all output is devot-
ed to investment, and
steady-state consumption
per worker is zero.

Figure 6.4 shows the limits to this strategy. A country with a low amount of capital
per worker may hope to improve long-run (steady-state) living standards substan-
tially by increasing its capital–labor ratio. However, a country that already has a
high level of capital per worker may ﬁnd that further increases in the capital– labor
ratio fail to raise steady-state consumption much. The fundamental reason for this
M06_ABEL4529_07_SE_C06.QXD  12/11/09  3:09 AM  Page 218
Chapter 6 Long-Run Economic Growth 219
outcome is the diminishing marginal productivity of capital—that is, the larger the
capital stock already is, the smaller the beneﬁt from expanding the capital stock fur-
ther. Indeed, Fig. 6.4 shows that, theoretically , capital per worker can be so high that
further increases will actually lower steady-state consumption per worker.
In any economy in the world today, could a higher capital stock lead to less
consumption in the long run? An empirical study of seven advanced industrial
countries concluded that the answer is “no.” Even for high-saving Japan, further
increases in capital per worker would lead to higher steady-state consumption per
worker.
18
Thus in our analysis we will always assume that an increase in the
steady-state capital–labor ratio raises steady-state consumption per worker.
Reaching the Steady State. Our discussion of steady states leaves two loose
ends. First, we need to say something about why an economy like the one we
describe here eventually will reach a steady state, as we claimed earlier. Second,
we have not yet shown which steady state the economy will reach; that is, we
would like to know the steady-state level of consumption per worker and the
steady-state capital–labor ratio that the economy will eventually attain.
To tie up these loose ends, we need one more piece of information: the rate at
which people save. To keep things as simple as possible, suppose that saving in this
economy is proportional to current income:
(6.9)
where S
t
is national saving
19
in year t and s is the saving rate, which we assume to
be constant. Because a $1 increase in current income raises saving, but by less than
$1 (see Chapter 4), we take s to be a number between 0 and 1. Equation (6.9) ignores
some other determinants of saving discussed in earlier chapters, such as the real
interest rate. However, including these other factors wouldn’t change our basic con-
clusions, so for simplicity we omit them.
In every year, national saving, S
t
, equals investment, I
t
. Therefore
(6.10)
where the left side of Eq. (6.10) is saving (see Eq. 6.9) and the right side of Eq. (6.10)
is steady-state investment (see Eq. 6.6).
Equation (6.10) shows the relation between total output, Y
t
, and the total cap-
ital stock, K
t
, that holds in the steady state. To determine steady-state capital per
worker, we divide both sides of Eq. (6.10) by N
t
. We then use the production func-
tion, Eq. (6.5), to replace y
t
with f(k
t
):
(6.11)
Equation (6.11) indicates that saving per worker, sf(k), equals steady-state invest-
ment per worker, (n + d)k. Because the capital–labor ratio, k, is constant in the
steady state, we again drop the subscripts, t, from the equation.
With Eq. (6.11) we can now determine the steady-state capital–labor ratio that the
economy will attain, as shown in Fig. 6.5. The capital–labor ratio is measured along
the horizontal axis. Saving per worker and investment per worker are measured on
the vertical axis.

With no government in this model, national saving and private saving are the same.
M06_ABEL4529_07_SE_C06.QXD  12/11/09  3:09 AM  Page 219
220 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
The bowed curve shows how the amount of saving per worker, sf(k), is related
to the capital–labor ratio. This curve slopes upward because an increase in the
capital–labor ratio implies higher output per worker and thus more saving per
worker. The saving-per-worker curve has the same general shape as the per-worker
production function, because saving per worker equals the per-worker production
function, f(k), multiplied by the ﬁxed saving rate, s.
The line in Fig. 6.5 represents steady-state investment per worker, (n + d)k. The
steady-state investment line slopes upward because, as the capital–labor ratio rises,
more investment per worker is required to replace depreciating capital and equip
new workers with the same high level of capital.
According to Eq. (6.11), the steady-state capital–labor ratio must ensure that
saving per worker and steady-state investment per worker are equal. The one
level of the capital–labor ratio for which this condition is satisfied is shown in
Fig. 6.5 as k*, the value of k at which the saving curve and the steady-state
investment line cross. For any other value of k, saving and steady-state invest-
ment won’t be equal. Thus k* is the only possible steady-state capital–labor ratio
for this economy.
20
With the unique steady-state capital–labor ratio, k*, we can also ﬁnd steady-state
output and consumption per worker. From the per-worker production function, Eq.
(6.5), if the steady-state capital–labor ratio is k*, steady-state output per worker, y*, is
y* = f(k*).
Figure 6.5
Determining the
capital–labor ratio in
the steady state
The steady-state capital–
labor ratio, k*, is deter-
mined by the condition
that saving per worker,
sf(k), equals steady-state
investment per worker,
(n + d)k. The steady-state
capital–labor ratio, k*,
corresponds to point A,
where the saving curve
and the steady-state
investment line cross.
From any starting point,
eventually the capital–
labor ratio reaches k*. If
the capital–labor ratio
happens to be below k*
(say, at k
1
), saving per
worker, sf(k
1
), exceeds
the investment per
worker, (n + d)k
1
, needed
to maintain the capital–
labor ratio at k
1
. As this
extra saving is converted
into capital, the capital–
labor ratio will rise, as
indicated by the arrows.
Similarly, if the capital–
labor ratio is greater than
k* (say, at k
2
), saving is
too low to maintain the
capital–labor ratio, and
the capital–labor ratio
will fall over time.

Actually, there is also a steady state at the point k = 0, at which the capital stock, output, and
consumption are zero forever. However, as long as the economy starts out with a positive amount
of capital, it will never reach the zero-capital steady state.
M06_ABEL4529_07_SE_C06.QXD  12/11/09  3:09 AM  Page 220
Chapter 6 Long-Run Economic Growth 221
From Eq. (6.8) steady-state consumption per worker, c*, equals steady-state
output per worker, f(k*), minus steady-state investment per worker, (n + d)k*:
Recall that, in the empirically realistic case, a higher value of the steady-state cap-
ital–labor ratio, k*, implies greater steady-state consumption per worker, c*.
Using the condition that in a steady state, national saving equals steady-state
investment, we found the steady-state capital–labor ratio, k*. When capital per
worker is k*, the amount that people choose to save will just equal the amount of
investment necessary to keep capital per worker at k*. Thus, when the economy’s
capital–labor ratio reaches k*, it will remain there forever.
But is there any reason to believe that the capital–labor ratio will ever reach k*
if it starts at some other value? Yes, there is. Suppose that the capital–labor ratio
happens to be less than k*; for example, it equals k
1
in Fig. 6.5. When capital per
worker is k
1
, the amount of saving per worker, sf(k
1
), is greater than the amount of
investment needed to keep the capital–labor ratio constant, (n + d)k
1
. When this
extra saving is invested to create new capital, the capital–labor ratio will rise. As
indicated by the arrows on the horizontal axis, the capital–labor ratio will increase
from k
1
toward k*.
If capital per worker is initially greater than k*—for example, if k equals k
2
in 
Fig. 6.5—the explanation of why the economy converges to a steady state is similar. If
the capital–labor ratio exceeds k*, the amount of saving that is done will be less than
the amount of investment that is necessary to keep the capital–labor ratio constant. (In
Fig. 6.5, when k equals k
2
, the saving curve lies below the steady-state investment line.)
Thus the capital–labor ratio will fall over time from k
2
toward k*, as indicated by the
arrows. Output per worker will also fall until it reaches its steady-state value.
To summarize, if we assume no productivity growth, the economy must even-
tually reach a steady state. In this steady state the capital–labor ratio, output per
worker, and consumption per worker remain constant over time. (However, total
capital, output, and consumption grow at rate n, the rate of growth of the labor
force.) This conclusion might seem gloomy because it implies that living standards
must eventually stop improving. However, that conclusion can be avoided if, in
fact, productivity continually increases.
The Fundamental Determinants of Long-Run Living Standards
What determines how well off the average person in an economy will be in the long
run? If we measure long-run well-being by the steady-state level of consumption
per worker, we can use the Solow model to answer this question. Here, we discuss
three factors that affect long-run living standards: the saving rate, population
growth, and productivity growth (see Summary table 8).
The Saving Rate. According to the Solow model, a higher saving rate implies
higher living standards in the long run, as illustrated in Fig. 6.6. Suppose that the
economy’s initial saving rate is s
1
so that saving per worker is s
1
f(k). The saving
curve when the saving rate is s
1
is labeled “Initial saving per worker.” The initial
steady-state capital–labor ratio, k
1
*, is the capital–labor ratio at which the initial
saving curve and the investment line cross (point A).
Suppose now that the government introduces policies that strengthen the
incentives for saving, causing the country’s saving rate to rise from s
1
to s
2
. The
c* = f(k*) - (n + d)k*.
M06_ABEL4529_07_SE_C06.QXD  12/11/09  3:09 AM  Page 221
222 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
increased saving rate raises saving at every level of the capital–labor ratio. Graph-
ically, the saving curve shifts upward from s
1
f(k) to s
2
f(k). The new steady-state cap-
ital–labor ratio, k
2
*, corresponds to the intersection of the new saving curve and the
investment line (point B). Because k
2
* is larger than k*
1
, the higher saving rate has
increased the steady-state capital–labor ratio. Gradually, this economy will move to
the higher steady-state capital–labor ratio, as indicated by the arrows on the hori-
zontal axis. In the new steady state, output per worker and consumption per
worker will be higher than in the original steady state.

Chapter 6 Long-Run Economic Growth 223
An increased saving rate leads to higher output, consumption, and capital per
worker in the long run, so it might seem that a policy goal should be to make the
country’s saving rate as high as possible. However, this conclusion isn’t necessar-
ily correct: Although a higher saving rate raises consumption per worker in the
long run, an increase in the saving rate initially causes consumption to fall. This
decline occurs because, at the initial level of output, increases in saving and invest-
ment leave less available for current consumption. Thus higher future consumption
has a cost in terms of lower present consumption. Society’s choice of a saving rate
should take into account this trade-off between current and future consumption.
Beyond a certain point the cost of reduced consumption today will outweigh the
long-run beneﬁts of a higher saving rate.
Population Growth. In many developing countries a high rate of population
growth is considered to be a major problem, and reducing it is a primary policy
goal. What is the relationship between population growth and a country’s level of
development, as measured by output, consumption, and capital per worker?
The Solow model’s answer to this question is shown in Fig. 6.7. An initial
steady-state capital–labor ratio, k*
1
, corresponds to the intersection of the steady-
state investment line and the saving curve at point A. Now suppose that the rate of
population growth, which is the same as the rate of labor force growth, rises from
an initial level of n
1
to n
2
. What happens?
An increase in the population growth rate means that workers are entering the
labor force more rapidly than before. These new workers must be equipped with
capital. Thus, to maintain the same steady-state capital–labor ratio, the amount of
investment per current member of the work force must rise. Algebraically, the rise
in n increases steady-state investment per worker from (n
1
+ d)k to (n
2
+ d)k. This
increase in the population growth rate causes the steady-state investment line to
pivot up and to the left, as its slope rises from (n
1
+ d) to (n
2
+ d).
After the pivot of the steady-state investment line, the new steady state is at point
B. The new steady-state capital–labor ratio is k
2
*, which is lower than the original cap-
ital–labor ratio, k*
1
. Because the new steady-state capital–labor ratio is lower, the new
steady-state output per worker and consumption per worker will be lower as well.
Thus the Solow model implies that increased population growth will lower
living standards. The basic problem is that when the work force is growing rapid-
ly, a large part of current output must be devoted just to providing capital for the
new workers to use. This result suggests that policies to control population growth
will indeed improve living standards.
There are some counterarguments to the conclusion that policy should aim to
reduce population growth. First, although a reduction in the rate of population
growth n raises consumption per worker, it also reduces the growth rate of total
output and consumption, which grow at rate n in the steady state. Having fewer
people means more for each person but also less total productive capacity. For
some purposes (military, political) a country may care about its total output as
well as output per person. Thus, for example, some countries of Western Europe
are concerned about projections that their populations will actually shrink in the
next century, possibly reducing their ability to defend themselves or inﬂuence
world events.
Second, an assumption in the Solow model is that the proportion of the total
population that is of working age is fixed. When the population growth rate
changes dramatically, this assumption may not hold. For example, declining birth
M06_ABEL4529_07_SE_C06.QXD  12/11/09  3:09 AM  Page 223
224 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
rates in the United States imply that the ratio of working-age people to retirees will
become unusually low early in the twenty-ﬁrst century, a development that may
cause problems for Social Security funding and other areas such as health care.
Productivity Growth. A signiﬁcant aspect of the basic Solow model is that,
ultimately, the economy reaches a steady state in which output per capita is
constant. But in the introduction to this chapter we described how Japanese
output per person has grown by a factor of more than 30 since 1870! How can the
Solow model account for that sustained growth? The key is a factor that we
haven’t yet made part of the analysis: productivity growth.
The effects of a productivity improvement—the result of, say, a new technolo-
gy—are shown in Figs. 6.8 and 6.9. An improvement in productivity corresponds
to an upward shift in the per-worker production function because, at any prevail-
ing capital–labor ratio, each worker can produce more output. Figure 6.8 shows a
shift from the original production function, y = f
1
(k), to a “new, improved” pro-
duction function, y = f
2
(k). The productivity improvement corresponds to a beneﬁ-
cial supply shock, as explained in Chapter 3.
Figure 6.9 shows the effects of this productivity improvement in the Solow
model. As before, the initial steady state is determined by the intersection of the
saving curve and the steady-state investment line at point A; the corresponding
steady-state capital–labor ratio is k*
1
. The productivity improvement raises output
per worker for any level of the capital–labor ratio. As saving per worker is a con-
stant fraction, s, of output per worker, saving per worker also rises at any capi-
tal–labor ratio. Graphically, the saving curve shifts upward from sf
1
(k) to sf
2
(k),
now intersecting the steady-state investment line at point B. The new steady-state
capital–labor ratio is k
2
*, which is higher than the original steady-state capital–labor
ratio, k*
1
.

1. Productivity
increases
Overall, a productivity improvement raises steady-state output and consumption
per worker in two ways. First, it directly increases the amount that can be produced
at any capital–labor ratio. Second, as Fig. 6.9 shows, by raising the supply of saving,
a productivity improvement causes the long-run capital–labor ratio to rise. Thus a pro-
ductivity improvement has a doubly beneﬁcial impact on the standard of living.

226 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Like a one-time increase in the saving rate or decrease in the population growth
rate, a one-time productivity improvement shifts the economy only from one
steady state to a higher one. When the economy reaches the new steady state, con-
sumption per worker once again becomes constant. Is there some way to keep
consumption per worker growing indeﬁnitely?
In reality, there are limits to how high the saving rate can rise (it certainly can’t
exceed 100%!) or how low the population growth rate can fall. Thus higher saving
rates or slower population growth aren’t likely sources of continually higher living
standards. However, since the Industrial Revolution, if not before, people have
shown remarkable ingenuity in becoming more and more productive. In the very
long run, according to the Solow model, only these continuing increases in pro-
ductivity hold the promise of perpetually better living standards. Thus we con-
clude that, in the long run, the rate of productivity improvement is the dominant factor
determining how quickly living standards rise.
APPLICATION
The Growth of China
China has experienced soaring growth rates in recent years. Because of its size
(population of 1.3 billion), China could become the next great world economic
power. Although it has grown rapidly in the past few decades, China started from
such a low level of GDP per capita that the country has a long way to go before its
GDP per capita catches up to GDP per capita in advanced economies.
Table 6.4 shows that China’s GDP per capita compares poorly with other coun-
tries. As recently as 1998, China’s real GDP per capita was about 16% of Japan’s,
even though China and Japan were not very far apart in real GDP per capita in
1870. Real GDP per capita in China was actually lower in 1950 than it had been 80
years earlier in 1870.
In recent years, real GDP growth in China has been quite rapid. Figure 6.10
shows the growth rate of GDP in China compared with that in the United States.
In the past eight years, China’s GDP growth rate has averaged 10.2% per year,
whereas the U.S. GDP growth rate averaged just 2.2% per year. Analysts have
attributed the rapid growth rate in China to a tremendous increase in capital

investment, fast productivity growth that has arisen in part from the transition
from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, and increased trade
with other countries.
21
Because of its economic failures before 1979 when government central plan-
ners ran business ﬁrms, China has needed to rebuild its infrastructure, housing
stock, and production facilities. As a result, investment in China is a much higher
percentage of GDP than in most countries, including the United States. Con-
sumption spending is low relative to consumption in other countries, so the
saving rate in China is high. In fact, national saving in China is large enough to
ﬁnance the large amount of investment spending and still enable China to run a
current account surplus (see the goods market equilibrium condition in an open
economy, Eq. 5.3).
Given that China has a population four times the size of the U.S. population,
it may not be surprising that Chinese workers earn low wages and that China
competes internationally in labor-intensive industries rather than capital-intensive
industries. However, as China continues to grow and as its productivity keeps
rising along with the growth of its capital stock, China should eventually experi-
ence higher wages and an increased standard of living. The main problems that
China will face in the near future include a weak banking system, increasing
income inequality, and high unemployment among rural workers.

228 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
Endogenous Growth Theory
The traditional Solow model of economic growth has proved quite useful, but it
nevertheless has at least one serious shortcoming as a model of economic growth.
According to the Solow model, productivity growth is the only source of long-run
growth of output per capita, so a full explanation of long-run economic growth
requires an explanation of productivity growth. The model, however, simply takes
the rate of productivity growth as given, rather than trying to explain how it is
determined. That is, the Solow model assumes, rather than explains, the behavior of
the crucial determinant of the long-run growth rate of output per capita.
In response to this shortcoming of the Solow model, a new branch of growth
theory, endogenous growth theory, has been developed to try to explain produc-
tivity growth—and hence the growth rate of output—endogenously, or within the
model.
22
As we will see, an important implication of endogenous growth theory is
that a country’s long-run growth rate depends on its rate of saving and investment,
not only on exogenous productivity growth (as implied by the Solow model).
Here we present a simple endogenous growth model in which the number of
workers remains constant, a condition implying that the growth rate of output per
worker is simply equal to the growth rate of output. Our simple endogenous
growth model is based on the aggregate production function
(6.12)
where Y is aggregate output and K is the aggregate capital stock. The parameter A
in Eq. (6.12) is a positive constant. According to the production function in 
Eq. (6.12), each additional unit of capital increases output by A units, regardless of
how many units of capital are used in production. Because the marginal product of
capital, equal to A, does not depend on the size of the capital stock K, the produc-
tion function in Eq. (6.12) does not imply diminishing marginal productivity of cap-
ital. The assumption that the marginal productivity is constant, rather than
diminishing, is a key departure from the Solow growth model.
Endogenous growth theorists have provided a number of reasons to explain why ,
for the economy as a whole, the marginal productivity of capital may not be dimin-
ishing. One explanation emphasizes the role of human capital, the economists’ term
for the knowledge, skills, and training of individuals. As economies accumulate cap-
ital and become richer, they devote more resources to “investing in people,” through
improved nutrition, schooling, health care, and on-the-job training. This investment in
people increases the country’s human capital, which in turn raises productivity . If the
physical capital stock increases while the stock of human capital remains ﬁxed, there
will be diminishing marginal productivity of physical capital, as each unit of physical
capital effectively works with a smaller amount of human capital. Endogenous
growth theory argues that, as an economy’s physical capital stock increases, its human
capital stock tends to increase in the same proportion. Thus, when the physical capi-
tal stock increases, each unit of physical capital effectively works with the same
amount of human capital, so the marginal productivity of capital need not decrease.
Y = AK

Two important early articles in endogenous growth theory are Paul Romer, “Increasing Returns and
Long-Run Growth,” Journal of Political Economy, October 1986, pp. 1002–1037, and Robert E. Lucas, Jr.,
“On the Mechanics of Economic Development,” Journal of Monetary Economics, July 1988, pp. 3–42. 
A more accessible description of endogenous growth theory is in Paul Romer, “The Origins of
Endogenous Growth,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, Winter 1994, pp. 3–22.
M06_ABEL4529_07_SE_C06.QXD  12/11/09  3:09 AM  Page 228
A second rationalization of a constant marginal productivity of capital is based
on the observation that, in a growing economy, ﬁrms have incentives to undertake
research and development (R&D) activities. These activities increase the stock of
commercially valuable knowledge, including new products and production tech-
niques. According to this R&D-focused explanation, increases in capital and output
tend to generate increases in technical know-how, and the resulting productivity
gains offset any tendency for the marginal productivity of capital to decline.
Having examined why a production function like Eq. (6.12) might be a rea-
sonable description of the economy as a whole, once factors such as increased
human capital and research and development are taken into account, let’s work out
the implications of this equation. As in the Solow model, let’s assume that nation-
al saving, S, is a constant fraction s of aggregate output, AK, so that S = sAK. In a
closed economy, investment must equal saving. Recall that total investment equals
net investment (the net increase in the capital stock) plus depreciation, or I = ΔK +
dK. Therefore, setting investment equal to saving, we have
(6.13)
Next, we divide both sides of Eq. (6.13) by K and then subtract d from both
sides of the resulting equation to obtain the growth rate of the capital stock.
(6.14)
Because output is proportional to the capital stock, the growth rate of output 
equals the growth rate of the capital stock . Therefore Eq. (6.14) implies
(6.15)
Equation (6.15) shows that, in the endogenous growth model, the growth rate
of output depends on the saving rate s. As we are assuming that the number of
workers remains constant over time, the growth rate of output per worker equals
the growth rate of output given in Eq. (6.15), and thus depends on the saving rate
s. The result that the saving rate affects the long-run growth rate of output stands
in sharp contrast to the results of the Solow model, in which the saving rate does
not affect the long-run growth rate. Saving affects long-run growth in the endoge-
nous growth framework because, in that framework, higher rates of saving and
capital formation stimulate greater investment in human capital and R&D. The
resulting increases in productivity help to spur long-run growth. In summary, in
comparison to the Solow model, the endogenous growth model places greater
emphasis on saving, human capital formation, and R&D as sources of long-run
growth.
Although endogenous growth theory remains in a developmental stage, the
approach appears promising in at least two dimensions. First, this theory attempts
to explain, rather than assumes, the economy’s rate of productivity growth. Second,
it shows how the long-run growth rate of output may depend on factors, such as
the country’s saving rate, that can be affected by government policies. Many econ-
omists working in this area are optimistic that endogenous growth theory will
yield further insights into the creative processes underlying productivity growth,
while providing lessons that might be applied to help the poorest nations of the
world achieve substantially higher standards of living.

230 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
6.3 Government Policies to Raise Long-Run Living Standards
Increased growth and a higher standard of living in the long run often are cited by
political leaders as primary policy goals. Let’s take a closer look at government
policies that may be useful in raising a country’s long-run standard of living.
Policies to Affect the Saving Rate
The Solow model suggests that the rate of national saving is a principal determi-
nant of long-run living standards. However, this conclusion doesn’t necessarily
mean that policymakers should try to force the saving rate upward, because more
saving means less consumption in the short run. Indeed, if the “invisible hand” of
free markets is working well, the saving rate freely chosen by individuals should be
the one that optimally balances the beneﬁt of saving more (higher future living
standards) against the cost of saving more (less present consumption).
Despite the argument that saving decisions are best left to private individuals
and the free market, some people claim that U.S. residents save too little and that
U.S. policy should aim at raising the saving rate. One possible justiﬁcation for this
claim is that existing tax laws discriminate against saving by taxing away part of
the returns to saving; a “pro-saving” policy thus is necessary to offset this bias.
Another view is that people in the United States are just too shortsighted in their
saving decisions and must be encouraged to save more.
What policies can be used to increase saving? If saving were highly responsive
to the real interest rate, tax breaks that increase the real return that savers receive
would be effective. For example, some economists advocate taxing households on
how much they consume rather than on how much they earn, thereby exempting
from taxation the income that is saved. But, as we noted in Chapter 4, although
saving appears to increase when the expected real return available to savers rises,
most studies ﬁnd this response to be small.
An alternative and perhaps more direct way to increase the national saving rate
is by increasing the amount that the government saves; in other words, the gov-
ernment should try to reduce its deﬁcit or increase its surplus. Our analysis of the
twin deﬁcits debate (Chapter 5) indicated that reducing the deﬁcit by reducing gov-
ernment purchases will lead to more national saving. Many economists also argue
that raising taxes to reduce the deﬁcit or increase the surplus will also increase
national saving by leading people to consume less. However, believers in Ricardian
equivalence contend that tax increases without changes in current or planned gov-
ernment purchases won’t affect consumption or national saving.
Policies to Raise the Rate of Productivity Growth
Of the factors affecting long-run living standards, the rate of productivity growth may
well be the most important in that—according to the Solow model—only ongoing
productivity growth can lead to continuing improvement in output and consumption
per worker. Government policy can attempt to increase productivity in several ways.
23
23
According to endogenous growth theory, an increase in the saving rate will increase the rate of pro-
ductivity growth and hence increase the growth rates of output and consumption per worker. Thus,
in addition to the policies discussed here, government may attempt to increase productivity growth
by trying to increase the saving rate.

Chapter 6 Long-Run Economic Growth 231
Improving Infrastructure. Some research ﬁndings suggest a signiﬁcant link
between productivity and the quality of a nation’s infrastructure—its highways,
bridges, utilities, dams, airports, and other publicly owned capital.
24
The
construction of the interstate highway system in the United States, for example,
signiﬁcantly reduced the cost of transporting goods and stimulated tourism and
other industries. In the past quarter-century the rate of U.S. government
investment in infrastructure has fallen, leading to a decline in the quality and
quantity of public capital.
25
Reversing this trend, some economists argue, might
help achieve higher productivity. However, not everyone agrees that more
infrastructure investment is needed. For example, some critics have pointed out
that the links between productivity growth and infrastructure aren’t clear. If rich
countries are more likely to build roads and hospitals, perhaps higher
productivity growth leads to more infrastructure, rather than vice versa. Others
worry that infrastructure investments by the government may involve political
considerations (for example, favoring the districts of powerful members of
Congress) more than promoting economic efﬁciency.
Building Human Capital. Recent research ﬁndings point to a strong connection
between productivity growth and human capital. The government affects human
capital development through educational policies, worker training or relocation
programs, health programs, and in other ways. Speciﬁc programs should be
examined carefully to see whether beneﬁts exceed costs, but a case may be made
for greater commitment to human capital formation as a way to boost
productivity growth.
One crucial form of human capital, which we haven’t yet mentioned, is entre-
preneurial skill. People with the ability to build a successful new business or to
bring a new product to market play a key role in economic growth. Productivity
growth may increase if the government were to remove unnecessary barriers to
entrepreneurial activity (such as excessive red tape) and give people with entre-
preneurial skills greater incentives to use those skills productively.
26
Encouraging Research and Development. The government also may be able to
stimulate productivity growth by affecting rates of scientiﬁc and technical progress.
The U.S. government directly supports much basic scientiﬁc research (through the
National Science Foundation, for example). Most economists agree with this type of
policy because the beneﬁts of scientiﬁc progress, like those of human capital
development, spread throughout the economy. Basic scientiﬁc research may thus be
a good investment from society’s point of view, even if no individual ﬁrm ﬁnds
such research proﬁtable. Some economists would go further and say that even more
applied, commercially oriented research deserves government aid.

232 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. Economic growth is the principal source of improving
standards of living over time. Over long periods, even
small differences in growth rates can have a large
effect on nations’ standards of living.
2. Growth accounting is a method for breaking total
output growth into the portions resulting from
growth in capital inputs, growth in labor inputs, and
growth in productivity. All three factors have con-
tributed to long-run economic growth in the United
States. However, the slowdown in U.S. output
growth after 1973 (and in other countries) primarily
reﬂects a sharp decline in productivity growth. Part
of this slowdown may be illusory, a product of mea-
surement problems. Other explanations of the
decline in productivity growth include the legal and
human environment (for example, increased worker
safety), increased oil prices, and the cost of adopting
new information technologies.
3. The Solow model of economic growth examines the
interaction of growth, saving, and capital accumula-
tion over time. It predicts that in the absence of pro-
ductivity growth the economy will reach a steady
state in which output, consumption, and capital per
worker are constant.
4. According to the Solow model, each of the following
leads to higher output, consumption, and capital per
worker in the long run: an increase in the saving rate,
a decline in the population growth rate, and an
increase in productivity.
5. Endogenous growth theory attempts to explain,
rather than assumes, the economywide rate of pro-
ductivity growth. One strand of this approach
emphasizes the formation of human capital, includ-
ing the acquisition of skills and training by workers.
A second strand focuses on research and develop-
ment activity by ﬁrms. Endogenous growth theorists
argue that, because growth in capital and output
engenders increased human capital and innovation,
the marginal productivity of capital may not be
diminishing for the economy as a whole. An impli-
cation of this theory is that the saving rate can affect
the long-run rate of economic growth.
6. Government policies to raise long-run living stan-
dards include raising the rate of saving and increas-
ing productivity. Possible ways of increasing
productivity involve investing in public capital
(infrastructure), encouraging the formation of human
capital, and increasing research and development.

The growth accounting equation states that output
growth, , depends on the growth rate of productiv-
ity, , the growth rate of capital, , and the
growth rate of labor, . The elasticity of output with
respect to capital, a
K
, gives the percentage increase in
output that results when capital increases by 1%. The elas-
ticity of output with respect to labor, a
N
, gives the per-
centage increase in output that results when labor
increases by 1%.

where k is the steady-state capital–labor ratio. Steady-state
investment per worker has two parts: equipping new
workers with the per-worker capital stock, nk, and replac-
ing worn-out or depreciated capital, dk.

Chapter 6 Long-Run Economic Growth 233
(6.11)
The steady state is determined by the condition that
saving per worker, sf(k), equals steady-state investment
per worker, Saving per worker equals the
saving rate s times output per worker, f(k).
(6.12)
Endogenous growth theory replaces the assumption of
diminishing marginal productivity of capital with the
assumption that the marginal productivity of capital is inde-
pendent of the level of the capital stock. In the production

(n + d)k.
sf(k) = (n + d)k function relating aggregate output Y to the aggregate capital
stock K in Eq. (6.12), the marginal product of capital is con-
stant and equal to the parameter A.
(6.15)
In an endogenous growth model, the growth rate of output,
, is determined endogenously by the saving rate, s.
An increase in the saving rate increases the growth rate
of output.

WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. This problem asks you to do your own growth
accounting exercise. Using data since 1948, make a
table of annual growth rates of real GDP, the capital
stock (private ﬁxed assets from the Fixed Assets sec-
tion of the BEA Web site, www.bea.gov, Table 6.1), and
civilian employment. Assuming a
K
= 0.3 and a
N
= 0.7,
ﬁnd the productivity growth rate for each year.
2. An economy is in a steady state with no productivity
change. Because of an increase in acid rain, the rate of
capital depreciation rises permanently.
a. According to the Solow model, what are the effects
on steady-state capital per worker, output per
worker, consumption per worker, and the long-run
growth rate of the total capital stock?
b. In an endogenous growth model, what are the
effects on the growth rates of output, capital, and
consumption of an increase in the depreciation rate
of capital?

on the steady-state levels of capital per worker,

Find the steady-state values of per-worker capital,

5. Two countries are identical in every way except that one
has a much higher capital–labor ratio than the other.
According to the Solow model, which country’s total
output will grow more quickly? Does your answer
depend on whether one country or the other is in a
steady state? In general terms, how will your answer be
affected if the two countries are allowed to trade with
each other?
6. Suppose that total capital and labor both increase by the
same percentage amount, so that the amount of capital
per worker, k, doesn’t change. Writing the production
function in per-worker terms, y = f(k), requires that this
increase in capital and labor must not change the amount
of output produced per worker, y. Use the growth
accounting equation to show that equal percentage
increases in capital and labor will leave output per
worker unaffected only if a

, where A and a are ﬁxed parameters, y is per-
worker output, k is the capital–labor ratio, and h is
human capital per worker, a measure of the skills and
training of the average worker. The production function
implies that, for a given capital–labor ratio, increases in
average human capital raise output per worker.
The economy’s saving rate is s, and all saving is
used to create physical capital, which depreciates at rate
d. Workers acquire skills on the job by working with cap-
ital; the more capital with which they have to work, the
more skills they acquire. We capture this idea by assum-
ing that human capital per worker is always proportion-
al to the amount of physical capital per worker, or h = Bk,
where B is a ﬁxed parameter.
Find the long-run growth rates of physical capital,
human capital, and output in this economy.
a. Graph the contributions to overall economic growth
of capital growth, labor growth, and productivity
growth for the period since 1948. Contrast the
behavior of each of these variables in the post–1973
period to their behavior in the earlier period.
b. Compare the post–1973 behavior of productivity
growth with the graph of the relative price of
energy, shown in Fig. 3.12. To what extent do you
think the productivity slowdown can be blamed
on higher energy prices?

2. Graph the U.S. capital–labor ratio since 1948 (use
private fixed assets from the Fixed Assets section of
the BEA Web site, www.bea.gov, Table 6.1 as the mea-
sure of capital, and civilian employment as the mea-
sure of labor). Do you see evidence of convergence
to a steady state during the postwar period? Now
graph real output per worker and real consumption
per worker for the same period. According to the
Solow model, what are the two basic explanations
for the upward trends in these two variables? Can
output per worker and consumption per worker
continue to grow even if the capital–labor ratio
stops rising?
3. According to the Solow model, if countries differed
primarily in terms of their capital–labor ratios, with
rich countries having high capital–labor ratios and
poor countries having low capital–labor ratios, then
countries that have a lower real GDP per capita
income should grow faster than countries with a
higher real GDP per capita. (This prediction of the
Solow model assumes that countries have similar
saving rates, population growth rates, and produc-
tion functions.) You can test this idea using the Penn
World Tables at pwt.econ.upenn.edu. Pick a group of
ten countries and examine their initial levels of real
GDP per capita in a year long ago, such as 1950.
Then calculate the average growth rate of real GDP
per capita since that initial year. Do your results
suggest that countries that initially have lower real
GDP per capita indeed grow faster than countries
that initially have a higher real GDP per capita?

CHAPTER 7
The Asset Market, 
Money, and Prices
In Chapters 3 and 4 we discussed the labor market and the goods market, two of
the three markets in our model of the macroeconomy. In this chapter we consider
the third market, the asset market. By asset market we mean the entire set of markets
in which people buy and sell real and ﬁnancial assets, including, for example,
gold, houses, stocks, and bonds.
A type of asset that has long been believed to have special macroeconomic
significance is money. Money is the economist’s term for assets that can be used
in making payments, such as cash and checking accounts. One reason that
money is important is that most prices are expressed in units of money, such as
dollars, yen, and euros. Because prices are measured in money terms, under-
standing the role of money in the economy is basic to studying issues related to
the price level, such as inflation and its causes. In addition, many economists
believe that the amount of money in the economy affects real economic vari-
ables, such as output and employment. If it does, then it may be possible to use
monetary policy to promote stable output growth and fight unemployment, as
we discuss in Part 3.
Because money is such an important asset, it is the focus of our discussion of
the asset market. In the first part of the chapter we explain what money is and
why people choose to hold it. We show that a person’s decision about how
much money to hold (his or her money demand) is part of a broader decision
about how to allocate wealth among the various assets that are available. We
then bring together the demand for money and the supply of money (which is
determined by the central bank) to analyze equilibrium in the asset market. This
analysis demonstrates that the price level in an economy is closely related to the
amount of money in the economy. Thus high rates of inflation—that is, rapid
increases in prices—are likely when the money supply is growing rapidly.
7.1 What is Money?
In economics the meaning of the term money is different from its everyday meaning.
People often say money when they mean income or wealth, as in: That job pays good
money, or Her family has a lot of money. In economics, however, money refers
speciﬁcally to assets that are widely used and accepted as payment. Historically, the
forms of money have ranged from beads and shells to gold and silver—and even to

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Money in a Prisoner-of-War Camp
Among the Allied soldiers liberated from German prisoner-of-war (POW) camps at
the end of World War II was a young man named R. A. Radford. Radford had been
trained in economics, and shortly after his return home he published an article enti-
tled “The Economic Organisation of a POW Camp.”* This article, a minor classic in
the economics literature, is a fascinating account of the daily lives of soldiers in
several POW camps. It focuses particularly on the primitive “economies” that grew
up spontaneously in the camps.
The scope for economic behavior in a POW camp might seem severely limited,
and to a degree that’s so. There was little production of goods within the camps,
although there was some trade in services, such as laundry or tailoring services and
even portraiture. However, prisoners were allowed to move around freely within
the compound, and they actively traded goods obtained from the Red Cross, the
Germans, and other sources. Among the commodities exchanged were tinned milk,
jam, butter, biscuits, chocolate, sugar, clothing, and toilet articles. In one particular
camp, which at various times had up to ﬁfty thousand prisoners of many nation-
alities, active trading centers were run entirely by the prisoners.
A key practical issue was how to organize the trading. At first, the camp
economies used barter, but it proved to be slow and inefﬁcient. Then the prisoners
hit on the idea of using cigarettes as money. Soon prices of all goods were quoted
in terms of cigarettes, and cigarettes were accepted as payment for any good or ser-
vice. Even nonsmoking prisoners would happily accept cigarettes as payment,
because they knew that they could easily trade the cigarettes for other things they
wanted. The use of cigarette money greatly simpliﬁed the problem of making
trades and helped the camp economy function much more smoothly.
Why were cigarettes, rather than some other commodity, used as money by the
POWs? Cigarettes satisﬁed a number of criteria for a good money: A cigarette is a
fairly standardized commodity whose value was easy for both buyers and sellers
to ascertain. An individual cigarette is low enough in value that making “change”
wasn’t a problem. Cigarettes are portable, are easily passed from hand to hand, and
don’t spoil quickly.
A drawback was that, as a commodity money (a form of money with an alter-
native use), cigarette money had a resource cost: Cigarettes that were being used as
money could not simultaneously be smoked. In the same way, the traditional use
of gold and silver as money was costly in that it diverted these metals from alter-
native uses.
The use of cigarettes as money isn’t restricted to POW camps. Just before the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, cigarette money reportedly was used in
Romania and other countries instead of the nearly worthless ofﬁcial money.

cigarettes (see ”In Touch with Data and Research: Money in a Prisoner-of-War
Camp”). In modern economies the most familiar forms of money are coins and paper
money, or currency. Another common form of money is checkable deposits, or bank
accounts on which checks can be written for making payments.
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:47 PM  Page 238
The Functions of Money
Since the earliest times almost all societies—from the most primitive to the most
sophisticated and with many types of political and economic systems—have used
money. Money has three useful functions in an economy: It is a medium of
exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.
Medium of Exchange. In an economy with no money, trading takes the form of
barter, or the direct exchange of certain goods for other goods. Even today some
people belong to barter clubs, in which members swap goods and services among
themselves. Generally, though, barter is an inefﬁcient way to trade because
ﬁnding someone who has the item you want and is willing to exchange that item
for something you have is both difﬁcult and time-consuming. In a barter system,
if one of the authors of this book wanted a restaurant meal, he would ﬁrst have to
ﬁnd a restaurateur willing to trade his blue-plate special for an economics
lecture—which might not be easy to do.
Money makes searching for the perfect trading partner unnecessary. In an
economy that utilizes money, the economics professor doesn’t have to ﬁnd a restau-
rant owner who is hungry for knowledge. Instead, he can ﬁrst exchange his eco-
nomics lecture to students for money and then use the money to buy a meal. In
functioning as a medium of exchange, or a device for making transactions, money
permits people to trade at less cost in time and effort. Having a medium of
exchange also raises productivity by allowing people to specialize in economic
activities at which they are most skilled. In an economy with money, specialized
producers have no problem trading their goods or services for the things they
need. In a barter economy, though, the difﬁculty of trading would leave people no
choice but to produce most of their own food, clothing, and shelter. Thus in a
barter economy the opportunity to specialize is greatly reduced.
Unit of Account. As a unit of account, money is the basic unit for measuring
economic value. In the United States, for example, virtually all prices, wages,
asset values, and debts are expressed in dollars. Having a single, uniform
measure of value is convenient. For example, pricing all goods in the United
States in dollars—instead of some goods being priced in yen, some in gold, and
some in Microsoft shares—simpliﬁes comparison among different goods.
The medium-of-exchange and unit-of-account functions of money are closely
linked. Because goods and services are most often exchanged for money (the medium-
of-exchange function), expressing economic values in money terms (the unit-of-
account function) is natural. Otherwise, we could just as well express economic values
in terms of, say, bushels of wheat. However, the medium of exchange and the unit of
account aren’t always the same. In countries with high and erratic inﬂation, for exam-
ple, ﬂuctuating currency value makes money a poor unit of account because prices
must be changed frequently. In such cases, economic values are commonly stated in
terms of a more stable unit of account, such as dollars or ounces of gold, even though
transactions may continue to be carried out in the local currency.
Store of Value. As a store of value, money is a way of holding wealth. An
extreme example is a miser who keeps his life’s savings in cash under the
mattress. But even someone who spends his cash wages ﬁfteen minutes after
receiving them is using money as a store of value for that short period.

240 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
In most cases, only money functions as a medium of exchange or a unit of
account, but any asset—for example, stocks, bonds, or real estate—can be a store of
value. As these other types of assets normally pay the holder a higher return than
money does, why do people use money as a store of value? The answer is that
money’s usefulness as a medium of exchange makes it worthwhile to hold, even
though its return is relatively low.
Measuring Money: The Monetary Aggregates. Money is deﬁned as those assets that
are widely used and accepted in payment. This deﬁnition suggests a hard-and-fast line
between assets that should be counted as money and those that should not. Actually,
the distinction between monetary assets and nonmonetary assets isn’t so clear.
Consider, for example, money market mutual funds (MMMFs), which ﬁrst
became popular in the late 1970s. MMMFs are organizations that sell shares to the
public and invest the proceeds in short-term government and corporate debt.
MMMFs strive to earn a high return for their shareholders. At the same time, they
typically allow their shareholders to write a small number of checks each month
against their accounts, perhaps for a fee. Thus, although MMMF shares can be
used to make payments, they are not as convenient as cash or regular checking
accounts for this purpose. Should MMMF shares be counted as money? There is no
deﬁnitive answer to this question.
Because assets differ in their “moneyness,” no single measure of the amount of
money in the economy—or the money stock, as it is often called—is likely to be com-
pletely satisfactory . For this reason, in most countries economists and policymakers use
several different measures of the money stock. These ofﬁcial measures are known as
monetary aggregates. The various monetary aggregates differ in how narrowly they
deﬁne the concept of money. In the United States the two monetary aggregates are
called M1 and M2. Summary deﬁnitions and data for these two aggregates are given
in Table 7.1. Information about where to ﬁnd data on the monetary aggregates is pre-
sented in “In Touch with Data and Research: The Monetary Aggregates.”
The M1 Monetary Aggregate. The most narrowly deﬁned ofﬁcial money measure,
M1, consists primarily of currency and balances held in checking accounts. More
precisely, M1 is made up of currency (including U.S. currency circulating outside
the United States; see “In Touch with Data and Research: Where Have All

the Dollars Gone?”, p. 242) and travelers’ checks held by the public, demand
deposits (non-interest-bearing checking accounts), and other checkable deposits.
The category “other checkable deposits” mainly consists of interest-bearing
checking accounts. M1 is perhaps the closest counterpart of the theoretical
deﬁnition of money because all its components are actively used and widely
accepted for making payments.
The M2 Monetary Aggregate. Everything in M1 plus other assets that are
somewhat less “moneylike” compose M2. The main additional assets in M2
include savings deposits, small-denomination (under $100,000) time deposits,
noninstitutional holdings of money market mutual funds (MMMFs), and money
market deposit accounts (MMDAs). Time deposits are interest-bearing deposits
with a ﬁxed term (early withdrawal usually involves a penalty). As mentioned,
MMMFs invest their shareholders’ funds in short-term securities, pay market-
based interest rates, and allow holders to write checks. MMDAs are like MMMFs,
except they are offered by banks or thrift institutions such as savings and loan
associations. In Table 7.1 we followed the presentation in the Federal Reserve
Bulletin and included MMDAs as part of savings deposits.
The Money Supply. The money supply is the amount of money available in an
economy.
1
In modern economies the money supply is determined by the central
bank—in the United States, the Federal Reserve System.
A detailed explanation of how central banks control the money supply raises
issues that would take us too far aﬁeld at this point, so we defer that discussion to
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The Monetary Aggregates
The ofﬁcial monetary aggregates—M1 and M2—are compiled and reported by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington. Only data for
M1 were reported until 1971, when the Fed introduced M2 and M3. Since then the
deﬁnitions of the monetary aggregates have changed several times, reﬂecting the
evolution of the ﬁnancial system. In 2006, the Fed stopped reporting M3.
The Fed reports estimates of the aggregates both weekly and monthly, using
data supplied by banks, the Treasury, money market mutual funds, foreign central
banks, and other sources. Each Thursday at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time the Fed
announces ﬁgures for M1 and M2 for the week ending the Monday of the previous
week. Historical data are available in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2, the Economic
Report of the President, and on the Federal Reserve System’s Web site at www.feder-
alreserve.gov/releases/H6. Monetary data are revised frequently, reﬂecting the receipt
of new data by the Federal Reserve or changes in the deﬁnitions of monetary
aggregates.
Publication of the monetary aggregates helps keep the public and Congress
informed about how the Fed is changing the nation’s money supply.

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Where Have All the Dollars Gone?
In June 2009 the stock of U.S. currency was $852 billion, or about $2800 for every
man, woman, and child in the United States. This ﬁgure is surprisingly high. After
all, how many people actually have $2800 of cash on hand at any given time, and
how many families of four hold over $10,000 in cash? In fact, studies have found
that the average person in the United States holds not much more than $100 in cur-
rency. So where is the remaining $2700 per person?
Businesses, especially retailers, hold currency for making transactions, but the
amount of currency held by U.S. businesses appears to account for less than $100 of
the “missing” $2700 per person. Currency also is extensively used in the underground
economy, either to conduct illegal transactions (such as trade in illegal drugs) or to
hide legal transactions from tax collectors. However, the Federal Reserve estimates
that the amount of currency in the domestic underground economy amounts to less
than $125 per person. Studies have found that most of the “missing” U.S. currency—
amounting to 50% to 70% of currency outstanding—is held abroad.*
Why would people in other countries want to hold U.S. dollars? Even though
the dollar may not serve as the medium of exchange or as a unit of account in a
country , it can be a relatively attractive store of value, especially in countries that are
economically or politically unstable. For example, in countries with high rates of
inﬂation, the local currency is a particularly poor store of value because the real
value (purchasing power) of the local currency decreases at the rate of inﬂation. In
high-inﬂation countries the dollar, which has had a relatively stable purchasing
power, may be much more attractive than local currency as a means of holding
wealth. Political instability in a country might also induce residents to demand U.S.
dollars because, if political upheaval forces people to ﬂee the country, carrying dol-
lars out may be the easiest way for them to take some of their wealth with them.
About half the U.S. currency sent overseas between 1988 and 1995 went to Europe,
much of it to Russia and other nations of Eastern Europe, which in recent years have
experienced substantial economic and political instability (see the Application
“Money Growth and Inﬂation in European Countries in Transition,” p. 264).
Because currency is more than one-half of M1 in the United States and more than
half of all U.S. currency is held abroad, more than one-fourth of U.S. M1 is in fact held
by foreign interests. Therefore events abroad that change the foreign demand for U.S.
dollars can cause substantial changes in measured U.S. monetary aggregates. Since
1947, many of the months with the fastest growth in U.S. currency holdings were
months in which a foreign crisis occurred. For example, U.S. currency growth was
*Most of the data in this box (except the months of most rapid currency growth) are reported in United
States Treasury Department, The Use and Counterfeiting of United States Currency Abroad, Part 3, September

Chapter 14. To grasp the basic idea, however, let’s consider the simple hypothetical
situation in which the only form of money is currency. In this case, to increase the
money supply the central bank needs only to increase the amount of currency in
circulation. How can it do so?
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:47 PM  Page 242

rapid in the months after lraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. And several of the months
with the fastest growth occurred in late 2008 and early 2009 during the worldwide
ﬁnancial crisis, where many foreigners traded their own currency for the safety of
U.S. dollars.** These large increases in U.S. currency outstanding were driven by for-
eign concerns about political, military , and ﬁnancial instability rather than by domes-
tic factors determining money demand in the U.S. economy.
Although foreign holdings of U.S. dollars reduce the reliability of measured
monetary aggregates as indicators of conditions in the U.S. economy, the United
States gets an important beneﬁt from the foreign holdings of its currency. U.S. cur-
rency is a liability of the Federal Reserve System and thus represents a loan to the
Federal Reserve System (and ultimately to the U.S. government, to which most
Federal Reserve proﬁts go). However, currency pays no interest, so this loan being
provided by foreign holders of U.S. currency to the United States is interest-free!
The interest savings associated with this interest-free loan to the U.S. government
amount to several billion dollars each year.
**The month with the highest (seasonally adjusted) currency growth rate was December 1999, when
businesses and individuals sharply increased their demand for cash in preparation for the century
rollover, Y2K.
One way—which is close to what happens in practice—is for the central bank
to use newly minted currency to buy ﬁnancial assets, such as government bonds,
from the public. In making this swap, the public increases its holdings of money,
and the amount of money in circulation rises. When the central bank uses money
to purchase government bonds from the public, thus raising the money supply, it
is said to have conducted an open-market purchase.
To reduce the money supply, the central bank can make this trade in reverse,
selling government bonds that it holds to the public in exchange for currency. After
the central bank removes this currency from circulation, the money supply is lower.
When the central bank sells government bonds to the public to reduce the money
supply, the transaction is an open-market sale. Open-market purchases and sales
together are called open-market operations.
In addition to buying government bonds from the public, the central bank can
also increase the money supply by buying newly issued government bonds direct-
ly from the government itself. For example, if a country’s treasury needs $1 billion
to pay for some new ﬁghter planes, it might give an IOU for $1 billion (government
bonds) to the central bank in exchange for $1 billion in newly minted currency. The
treasury then gives the $1 billion of currency to the manufacturer of the ﬁghter
planes. After the treasury has distributed this currency, the amount of money in cir-
culation—the money supply—will be higher by $1 billion. Effectively, this second
way of increasing the money supply amounts to the government ﬁnancing its
expenditures by printing money.

This practice is most common in poor countries
2
In Chapter 2 we said that the portion of government outlays not covered by taxes had to be bor-
rowed from the private sector. Is this still true when the government has the option of paying for its
outlays by printing money? Yes; for national income accounting purposes, the Federal Reserve is
treated as part of the private sector. So when the Treasury sells government bonds to the Federal
Reserve in exchange for currency, it is still technically borrowing from the private sector.

or in countries wracked by war or natural disaster, in which government spending
often greatly exceeds the amount that can be raised through taxes.

For the rest of this chapter we assume that the economy has a money supply of
M dollars, which is determined by the central bank. The term M may represent M1,
M2, or some other measure of money. For the purpose of developing the theoreti-
cal model, which measure of money M refers to doesn’t matter.
7.2 Portfolio Allocation and the Demand for Assets
Our next goal is to understand how people determine the amount of money they
choose to hold. We begin by considering the broader question of how people allo-
cate their wealth among the many different assets that are available, of which
money is only one example.
A consumer, a business, a pension fund, a university, or any other holder of
wealth must decide how to distribute that wealth among many types of assets. The
set of assets that a holder of wealth chooses to own is called a portfolio. The decision
about which assets and how much of each asset to hold is called the portfolio
allocation decision.
The portfolio allocation decision can be complex. Many people make their
living by giving ﬁnancial advice to holders of wealth, and a major branch of eco-
nomics, called ﬁnancial economics, is devoted largely to the study of the portfolio
allocation decision. But, fundamentally, only four characteristics of assets matter
for the portfolio allocation decision: expected return, risk, liquidity, and time to
maturity.
Expected Return
The rate of return to an asset is the rate of increase in its value per unit of time. For
example, the return on a bank account is the interest rate on the account. The
return on a share of stock is the dividend paid by the stock plus any increase in the
stock’s price. Clearly, a high return is a desirable feature for an asset to have: All
else being equal, the higher the return a wealth holder’s portfolio provides, the
more consumption she can enjoy in the future for any given amount of saving
done today.
Of course, the return on an asset is not always known in advance. Stock
prices may go up or down, for example. Thus holders of wealth must base
their portfolio allocation decisions on expected returns, or their best guesses
about returns on assets. Everything else being equal, the higher an asset’s
expected return (after subtracting taxes and fees such as brokers’ commissions),
the more desirable the asset is and the more of it holders of wealth will want
to own.

The ﬁnancing of government spending through money creation is discussed further in Chapter 15.

For the purpose of comparing expected returns among assets, returns may be expressed in either real
or nominal terms. For any expected rate of inﬂation, if asset A’s nominal return is 1% higher than
asset B’s nominal return, asset A’s expected real return (its nominal return minus expected inﬂation)
will also be 1% higher than asset B’s expected real return.

Chapter 7 The Asset Market, Money, and Prices 245
Risk
The uncertainty about the return an asset will earn relates to the second important
characteristic of assets—riskiness. An asset or a portfolio of assets has high risk if
there is a signiﬁcant chance that the actual return received will be very different
from the expected return. An example of a risky asset is a share in a start-up Inter-
net company that will be worthless if the company fails but will grow in value by
a factor of ten if the company succeeds. Because most people don’t like risk, they
hold risky assets only if the expected return is higher than that on relatively safe
assets, such as government bonds.
Liquidity
Besides risk and return a third characteristic, liquidity, affects the desirability of
assets. The liquidity of an asset is the ease and quickness with which it can be
exchanged for goods, services, or other assets. Because it is accepted directly in pay-
ment, money is a highly liquid asset. An example of an illiquid asset is your auto-
mobile: Time and effort are required to exchange a used car for other goods and
services; you must ﬁnd someone interested in buying the car and arrange legal
transfer of ownership. Between liquid money and illiquid autos are many assets,
such as stocks and bonds, of intermediate liquidity. A share of stock, for example,
can’t be used directly to pay for groceries as cash can, but stock can be transformed
into cash with a short delay and at the cost of a broker’s fee.
In addition to making transactions easier and cheaper, liquidity provides ﬂex-
ibility to the holder of wealth. A liquid asset can easily be disposed of if there is an
emergency need for funds or if an unexpectedly good ﬁnancial investment oppor-
tunity arises. Thus, everything else being equal, the more liquid an asset is, the
more attractive it will be to holders of wealth.
Time to Maturity
Financial securities have a fourth and ﬁnal key characteristic, which is their time to
maturity. Time to maturity is the amount of time until a ﬁnancial security matures
and the investor is repaid his or her principal. Considering time to maturity is espe-
cially relevant for all types of bonds, as an investor can purchase bonds that will
mature at any time—in one day, one week, one month, one year, or thirty years.
Let’s consider a couple that wants to buy bonds and keep their money invest-
ed for two years. They could choose one of two plans: Plan A is simply to buy a
two-year bond today; Plan B calls for buying a one-year bond today and another
one-year bond when that one matures one year from today. Ignoring, for the
moment, any differences in the risk between Plan A and Plan B, the investors
would choose the plan that they expect to give them the highest return over the two
years. For example, if today’s interest rate on the two-year bond is 7% per year,
today’s interest rate on a one-year bond is 5% per year, and if they expect the inter-
est rate on a one-year bond to be 6% per year one year from now, then their return
from Plan A (buying the two-year bond) is 7% per year and the return they expect
from Plan B is 5.5% per year, which is the average of the 5% per year return on the
one-year bond purchased today and the expected 6% per year return expected on
the bond to be bought one year from today. So the investors are likely to choose
Plan A; that is, they are likely to buy the two-year bond today.
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:47 PM  Page 245
246 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
The idea that investors compare the returns on bonds with differing times to
maturity to see which is expected to give them the highest return underlies the
expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates. “Term structure”
refers to the fact that the theory explains why bonds that are similar in all
respects except their terms to maturity have different rates of return. In equilib-
rium, according to the expectations theory, Plans A and B, which involve hold-
ing bonds with different terms to maturity over the same two-year period,
should yield the same expected return; that is, the interest rate on a two-year
bond should equal the average interest rate expected on two successive one-year
bonds, so that an investor does not prefer one investment over another. More
generally, the expected rate of return on an N-year bond should equal the aver-
age of the expected rates of return on one-year bonds during the current year
and the N-1 succeeding years.
Although the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates is a
useful starting point, it cannot explain why, on average, we observe that the inter-
est rates on long-term bonds generally exceed the interest rates on short-term
bonds. (See the graph of the yield curve on p. 115, which illustrates the term struc-
ture of interest rates.) When short-term interest rates are expected to be higher in
the future than the current short-term rate, the expectations theory predicts that the
long-term interest rate will exceed the short-term interest rate. However, when
short-term interest rates are expected to be lower in the future than the current
short-term interest rate, the expectations theory predicts that the long-term interest
rate will be lower than the short-term interest rate. To see why long-term interest
rates usually exceed short-term interest rates, we need to take account of the fact
that longer-term bonds are riskier than shorter-term bonds because the prices of
long-term bonds are more sensitive than the prices of short-term bonds are to
changes in the interest rate. Because investors do not like risk, they must be com-
pensated for holding longer-term bonds. The result is a term premium: an interest
rate on long-term bonds that is somewhat higher than the expectations theory
would suggest.
If we add the term premium to the expectations theory, we have a more
complete theory of how interest rates vary with time to maturity. For example,
suppose the interest rate on a one-year bond today is 5% per year, the interest
rate on a one-year bond one year from now is expected to be 6% per year, and
the term premium on a two-year bond is 0.75% per year. Then, in equilibrium,
the interest rate on a two-year bond should equal the average interest rate on
the one-year bonds, which equals (5% + 6%)/2 = 5.5%, plus the term premium,
0.75%, or 6.25%.
Types of Assets and Their Characteristics
What types of assets do people hold, and how do the characteristics of those
assets differ? Though there are many different assets, we will consider a few that
are the most popular: money, bonds, stocks, houses, and consumer durable
goods.
We have already seen in section 7.1 that there are different types of money. All
types of money usually have a low expected rate of return compared with other
assets. Money also usually does not have much risk, although there is always
some risk that inﬂation will be higher than expected, so that the real return to
holding money might turn out to be lower than expected. But money is very
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:47 PM  Page 246
Chapter 7 The Asset Market, Money, and Prices 247
liquid compared with the other assets; indeed, its liquidity is generally the
deﬁning characteristic of what we call money. Because of its liquidity, money’s
time to maturity is generally very short. However, some assets included in M2,
such as small time deposits, may have a longer time to maturity and are not
very liquid.
Bonds are ﬁnancial securities that are sometimes called ﬁxed-income securities
because they promise to pay bondholders specific amounts on specific dates.
People often choose to own bonds issued by the U.S. government because these
bonds have very little risk of default. Bonds issued by corporations are similar, but
there is always some chance that a corporation will go bankrupt and fail to pay the
interest or repay the principal it owes to its bondholders. Thus bonds offer a higher
expected return than money, but the return is riskier. Many bonds, especially those
sold by the U.S. government, are very liquid, as an investor can easily sell his or her
bond quickly and with low transactions costs. However, some corporate bonds are
not very liquid, especially in bad economic times, and it may be difﬁcult to sell
them without a high cost. Bonds are issued in a variety of times to maturity, gen-
erally ranging from 3 months to 30 years.
Stocks represent ownership in a company. Most stocks pay periodic divi-
dends to the shareholders, but the dividend payments are not guaranteed. When
the economy is weak and the company is not doing well, it may even stop paying
dividends altogether for a time. Prices of stocks rise and fall every day, so the
overall return to a shareholder consists of the dividends received plus any capi-
tal gain resulting from an increase in the value of the stock less any capital loss
resulting from a decrease in the value of the stock. Because dividends and, espe-
cially, stock prices can change unpredictably, stocks are subject to a substantial
amount of risk. Stocks in large companies are sold in very liquid markets, but
when you buy or sell a stock there is a delay of several days for the transaction to
clear and payment to be made. Most stocks do not have maturity dates, so the
time to maturity is inﬁnite.
Although most large companies are owned by shareholders who can readily
buy and sell shares of stock in organized stock exchanges, such as the New York
Stock Exchange, many small businesses are directly owned by one or a few people.
These businesses, which are directly owned by their proprietors, are not incorpo-
rated and do not issue stock that can be traded on exchanges. Because there are no
marketable shares of stock in these companies, it is difﬁcult for the owners to
quickly sell ownership in the companies, so this ownership is very illiquid. Indeed,
because there are no marketable shares, it is difﬁcult to measure accurately the
value of the ownership stake in these companies. The return to the owners of the
company takes the form of proﬁts earned by the company plus the opportunity
that they may someday sell the company.
For most homeowners, housing is their largest asset. The returns to owning a
house come in two forms: (1) the beneﬁts to the household in terms of shelter net of
maintenance costs and property taxes, and (2) the change in the value of the house
(or the land it sits on) over time. For a time in the 2000s, many people seemed to
think that there was no risk to investing in housing, and the United States and
many other countries went through a tremendous boom in which millions of homes
were built and it was very easy for home purchasers to get mortgage loans. But the
risk turned out to be much higher than investors thought, and an unexpected down-
turn in housing prices led to a ﬁnancial crisis, as we discuss in “In Touch with Data
and Research: The Housing Crisis That Began in 2007,” p. 249. Compared with

other assets, housing is very illiquid—it may take months or years for a household
to sell its home, especially in a recession. However, the availability of home equity
loans and home equity lines of credit permit households to quickly borrow money
against a portion of the value of their house. There is, of course, no speciﬁed time to
maturity on housing, as it is not a ﬁnancial security.
Households also hold some of their assets in the form of consumer durable
goods, such as automobiles and furniture. As in the case of housing, durable goods
provide services (such as transportation) over a period of time but may also require
maintenance expenditures and can depreciate over time. There is some risk to the
value of consumer durables, and it may be difﬁcult and costly to sell them, as the
market for used consumer durables is not as well developed as the market for
stocks and bonds. Thus, consumer durables are not very liquid, and, like housing,
have no speciﬁed time to maturity.
Households must determine what mix of these various assets is ideal for them.
Wealthier households generally purchase more ﬁnancial assets (stocks and bonds)
as a percentage of their total wealth than poorer households. Many households will
also put aside funds for retirement by holding assets in pension funds, which hold
stocks, bonds, and types of money (such as money-market mutual funds). Of
course, their mix of different assets may change when market conditions change.
For example, the housing crisis that began in 2007 and the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008
dramatically reduced the value of housing and stock holdings, as Table 7.2 indi-
cates. The table shows the amounts of each type of asset that households (and
nonproﬁt organizations) held at the end of 2006 and at the end of the ﬁrst quarter
of 2009. Note that the amount of currency and checkable deposits is far less than the
amounts listed in Table 7.1 under M1 because much currency is held overseas (see 
“In Touch with Data and Research: Where Have All the Dollars Gone?”, p. 242) and
because business firms have substantial holdings of currency and checkable
deposits. The table also reports how much of each type of asset households held as
a percentage of their total assets, so you can get a sense of how the relative amounts
of each type of asset changed between 2006 and 2009.

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The Housing Crisis That Began in 2007
U.S. households gained a tremendous amount of wealth in their houses throughout
the late 1990s and early 2000s. The housing market was booming and the home-
ownership rate rose to a record level of 68.6 percent of households by 2007. But as
people became more and more convinced that housing was a “can’t miss” invest-
ment and housing prices spiraled ever upwards, mortgage lenders and homeowners
began to make some serious mistakes, which would lead to a major ﬁnancial crisis.
As housing prices moved higher and higher in the early 2000s, many people
found themselves unable to afford to buy a home, because the monthly mortgage
payments would have been too high relative to their monthly incomes. Speciﬁcally ,
the lending standards of mortgage lenders required that borrowers have sufﬁcient
monthly income so that the monthly mortgage payment would not exceed a speci-
ﬁed percentage of monthly income. But as housing prices increased rapidly, mort-
gage lenders began making loans to people who did not meet the lending standards.
These people were known as subprime borrowers. The subprime mortgage market
grew rapidly. To compensate the lenders for the additional risk and potential costs
of lending to subprime borrowers, the interest rate on subprime mortgages was
higher than the interest rate on conventional or prime mortgages. In many cases,
subprime lenders even dispensed with the usual income veriﬁcation of borrowers,
thereby further subjecting themselves to the risk that the borrowers would not be
able to repay . In addition, some loans had creative features that gave the appearance
that the borrower could afford to make the monthly payments—at least for a while.
For instance, most subprime loans were adjustable-rate loans with a low initial
interest rate that would increase after two or three years in a process known as
mortgage reset.
Why were lenders willing to offer these risky loans to subprime borrowers, and
why were borrowers willing to take on these risky obligations? To a large degree,
the answer is that they expected house prices to continue to rise rapidly for the
foreseeable future. As long as house prices kept rising substantially, a borrower
who might otherwise have trouble making mortgage payments in the future could
either sell the house for a proﬁt and pay off the mortgage or could borrow against
the house’s equity value, which would be higher as house prices increased further.
So, both borrowers and lenders thought they were insulated from risk.
The problem with subprime mortgages is that the borrower and lender are
insulated from risk only as long as house prices continue to rise substantially. In
2005, as mortgage interest rates across the country began to rise, the rate of increase
of house prices began to slow. In 2006, defaults on subprime mortgages began to
increase, as borrowers who had counted on rapidly rising house prices to bail them
out found that their houses were not worth as much as they expected. In addition,
as mortgage resets began to set in at higher interest rates, more and more borrowers
could no longer make their monthly mortgage payments and began to default on
their mortgages. And as defaults began to occur in increasing numbers, banks start-
ed to tighten their lending standards, so that by mid 2007, they were making few if
any subprime mortgage loans. But that, in turn, reduced the demand for houses,
thus causing the increase in housing prices to be even smaller. House prices even

Year
Home price increase (percent per year)
began to decline in some areas of the country in 2007 and by 2008 began to fall for
the nation as a whole, as shown in Fig. 7.1.
Falling house prices caused a variety of problems, at both the micro level and
macro level. Thousands of households that had bought houses with subprime mort-
gages lost their homes through foreclosure when they could not make their mort-
gage payments. Homeowners often found themselves owning homes whose value
had fallen far below the amount they owed on their mortgage loans (a situation that
came to be known as “underwater”), giving them the incentive to stop making
mortgage payments and allow their homes to be repossessed. Financial institutions
lost billions of dollars on such deals because they owned the rights to the mortgage
payments, which would no longer occur. Since house prices had fallen, whoever
came to own the house, usually a bank, would usually have to sell it for much less
than the outstanding mortgage balance.
But what surprised many people about the problems in the mortgage market
is that the impact was felt even more broadly. It turns out that most banks had sold
bundles of their mortgages in the form of mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), and
investors in MBSs suffered large losses. Once the losses began to materialize,
investors all at once tried to bail out of such investments, driving their prices to
very low levels. This, in turn, led to the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, when investors
began to realize that many ﬁnancial institutions had lost hundreds of billions of
dollars through mortgage-related securities. Panic ensued, stock prices fell dra-
matically, especially for ﬁnancial ﬁrms, and the government and Federal Reserve
bailed out many ﬁnancial ﬁrms, as we describe in more detail in the Application
“The Financial Crisis of 2008,” p. 551.
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:48 PM  Page 250
Chapter 7 The Asset Market, Money, and Prices 251
At the end of 2006, households had over $76 trillion in assets, with over 
$24 trillion worth of real estate and almost $13.9 trillion in stocks, as well as almost
$13 trillion in pension fund assets. The steep declines in house prices and stock
prices and the drop in proprietors’ investment in unincorporated businesses
reduced household wealth by more than $10 trillion. The value of real estate hold-
ings declined by 18 percent, pension assets fell 22 percent, and the value of stock
holdings fell almost 40 percent from the end of 2006 to early 2009. Over this period
of time, households reallocated their portfolios, putting more of their wealth in the
form of money (time and savings deposits) and bonds (especially government
bonds with little default risk).
Asset Demands
Typically, there is a trade-off among the four characteristics that make an asset
desirable: a high expected return, safety (low risk), liquidity, and time to maturity.
For example, a safe and liquid asset with a short time to maturity, such as a check-
ing account, is likely to have a low expected return. The essence of the portfolio
allocation decision is determining which assets, taken together, achieve the wealth
holder’s preferred combination of expected return, safety, liquidity, and time to
maturity. In addition to the risk of each asset separately, the investor should also
consider diversiﬁcation, the idea that spreading out his or her investment in dif-
ferent assets can reduce his or her overall risk, because when one asset has a low
return, another may have a high return.
The amount of each particular asset that a holder of wealth desires to include
in his or her portfolio is called his or her demand for that asset. Because all wealth
must be held as some type of asset, the sum of a wealth holder’s asset demands
must equal his or her total wealth. For example, suppose that you have wealth of
$10,000 and decide to hold $5000 in stock, $3000 in short-term bonds, $1000 in
long-term bonds, and $1000 in cash. The sum of your four asset demands must
equal your total wealth of $10,000.
7.3 The Demand for Money
The demand for money is the quantity of monetary assets, such as cash and
checking accounts, that people choose to hold in their portfolios. Choosing how
much money to demand is thus a part of the broader portfolio allocation decision.
In general, the demand for money—like the demand for any other asset—will
depend on the expected return, risk, liquidity, and time to maturity of money and
other assets.
In practice, two features of money are particularly important. First, money is
the most liquid asset. This liquidity is the primary beneﬁt of holding money.
5
Second, money pays a low return (indeed, currency pays a zero nominal return).
The low return earned by money, relative to other assets, is the major cost of hold-
ing money. People’s demand for money is determined by how they trade off their
desire for liquidity against the cost of a lower return.
5
Money also has low risk, but many alternative assets (such as short-term government bonds) are not
much riskier than money and pay a higher return.
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:48 PM  Page 251
252 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
In this section we look at how some key macroeconomic variables affect the
demand for money . Although we primarily consider the aggregate, or total, demand
for money, the same economic arguments apply to individual money demands.
This relationship is to be expected, as the aggregate demand for money is the sum
of all individual money demands.
The macroeconomic variables that have the greatest effects on money demand
are the price level, real income, and interest rates. Higher prices or incomes increase
people’s need for liquidity and thus raise the demand for money. Interest rates
affect money demand through the expected return channel: The higher the interest
rate on money, the more money people will demand; however, the higher the inter-
est rate paid on alternative assets to money, the more people will want to switch
from money to those alternative assets.
The Price Level
The higher the general level of prices, the more dollars people need to conduct
transactions and thus the more dollars people will want to hold. For example,
seventy years ago the price level in the United States was about one-tenth of its
level today; as your grandfather will tell you, in 1940 a good restaurant meal cost
a dollar. Because less money was needed for transactions, the number of dollars
your grandfather held in the form of currency or checking accounts—his nominal
demand for money—was probably much smaller than the amount of money you
hold today. The general conclusion is that a higher price level, by raising the need
for liquidity, increases the nominal demand for money. In fact, because prices are
ten times higher today than they were in 1940, an identical transaction takes ten
times as many dollars today as it did back then. Thus, everything else being equal,
the nominal demand for money is proportional to the price level.
Real Income
The more transactions that individuals or businesses conduct, the more liquidity
they need and the greater is their demand for money. An important factor deter-
mining the number of transactions is real income. For example, a large, high-
volume supermarket has to deal with a larger number of customers and suppliers
and pay more employees than does a corner grocery. Similarly, a high-income indi-
vidual makes more and larger purchases than a low-income individual. Because
higher real income means more transactions and a greater need for liquidity, the
amount of money demanded should increase when real income increases.
Unlike the response of money demand to changes in the price level, the
increase in money demand need not be proportional to an increase in real income.
Actually, a 1% increase in real income usually leads to less than a 1% increase in
money demand. One reason that money demand grows more slowly than income
is that higher-income individuals and ﬁrms typically use their money more efﬁ-
ciently. For example, a high-income individual may open a special cash manage-
ment account in which money not needed for current transactions is automatically
invested in nonmonetary assets paying a higher return. Because of minimum-
balance requirements and fees, such an account might not be worthwhile for a
lower-income individual.
Another reason that money demand grows more slowly than income is that a
nation’s ﬁnancial sophistication tends to increase as national income grows. In
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:48 PM  Page 252
Chapter 7 The Asset Market, Money, and Prices 253
poor countries people may hold much of their saving in the form of money, for lack
of anything better; in richer countries people have many attractive alternatives to
money. Money substitutes such as credit cards also become more common as a
country becomes richer, again causing aggregate money demand to grow more
slowly than income.
Interest Rates
The theory of portfolio allocation implies that, with risk and liquidity held con-
stant, the demand for money depends on the expected returns of both money and
alternative, nonmonetary assets. An increase in the expected return on money
increases the demand for money, and an increase in the expected return on alter-
native assets causes holders of wealth to switch from money to higher-return
alternatives, thus lowering the demand for money.
For example, suppose that, of your total wealth of $10,000, you have $8000 in
government bonds earning 8% interest and $2000 in an interest-bearing checking
account earning 3%. You are willing to hold the checking account at a lower return
because of the liquidity it provides. But if the interest rate on bonds rises to 10%, and
the checking account interest rate remains unchanged, you may decide to switch
$1000 from the checking account into bonds. In making this switch, you reduce
your holding of money (your money demand) from $2000 to $1000. Effectively , you
have chosen to trade some liquidity for the higher return offered by bonds.
Similarly, if the interest rate paid on money rises, holders of wealth will choose
to hold more money. In the example, if the checking account begins paying 5%
instead of 3%, with bonds still at 8%, you may sell $1000 of your bonds, lowering
your holdings of bonds to $7000 and increasing your checking account to $3000. The
sacriﬁce in return associated with holding money is less than before, so you increase
your checking account balance and enjoy the ﬂexibility and other beneﬁts of extra
liquidity. Thus a higher interest rate on money makes the demand for money rise.
In principle, the interest rate on each of the many alternatives to money should
affect money demand. However, as previously noted (see “In Touch with Data and
Research: Interest Rates,” p. 114), the many interest rates in the economy generally tend
to move up and down together. For the purposes of macroeconomic analysis, therefore,
assuming that there is just one nominal interest rate, i, which measures the nominal
return on nonmonetary assets, is simpler and not too misleading. The nominal interest
rate, i, minus the expected inﬂation rate, p
e
, gives the expected real interest rate, r, that
is relevant to saving and investment decisions, as discussed in Chapter 4.
Also, in reality , various interest rates are paid on money . For example, currency
pays zero interest, but different types of checkable accounts pay varying rates.
Again for simplicity, let’s assume that there is just one nominal interest rate for
money, i
m
. The key conclusions are that an increase in the interest rate on non-
monetary assets, i, reduces the amount of money demanded and that an increase in
the interest rate on money, i
m
, raises the amount of money demanded.
The Money Demand Function
We express the effects of the price level, real income, and interest rates on money
demand as
(7.1) M
d
= P * L(Y, i),
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:48 PM  Page 253
254 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
where
M
d
= the aggregate demand for money, in nominal terms;
P = the price level;
Y = real income or output;
i = the nominal interest rate earned by alternative, nonmonetary assets;
L = a function relating money demand to real income and the nominal
interest rate.
Equation (7.1) holds that nominal money demand, M
d
, is proportional to the
price level, P. Hence, if the price level, P, doubles (and real income and interest
rates don’t change), nominal money demand, M
d
, also will double, reﬂecting the
fact that twice as much money is needed to conduct the same real transactions.
Equation (7.1) also indicates that, for any price level, P, money demand depends
(through the function L) on real income, Y, and the nominal interest rate on non-
monetary assets, i. An increase in real income, Y, raises the demand for liquidity
and thus increases money demand. An increase in the nominal interest rate, i,
makes nonmonetary assets more attractive, which reduces money demand.
We could have included the nominal interest rate on money, i
m
, in Eq. (7.1)
because an increase in the interest rate on money makes people more willing to
hold money and thus increases money demand. Historically, however, the nom-
inal interest rate on money has varied much less than the nominal interest rate on
nonmonetary assets (for example, currency and a portion of checking accounts
always have paid zero interest) and thus has been ignored by many statistical
studies of Eq. (7.1). Thus for simplicity we do not explicitly include i
m
in the
equation.
An equivalent way of writing the demand for money expresses the nominal
interest rate, i, in terms of the expected real interest rate and the expected rate of
inﬂation. Recall from Eq. (2.13) that the expected real interest rate, r, equals the
nominal interest rate, i, minus the expected rate of inﬂation, p
e
. Therefore the nom-
inal interest rate, i, equals r + p
e
. Substituting r + p
e
for i in Eq. (7.1) yields
(7.2)
Equation (7.2) shows that, for any expected rate of inﬂation, p
e
, an increase in
the real interest rate increases the nominal interest rate and reduces the demand for
money. Similarly, for any real interest rate, an increase in the expected rate of inﬂa-
tion increases the nominal interest rate and reduces the demand for money.
Nominal money demand, M
d
, measures the demand for money in terms of dol-
lars (or yen or euros). But, sometimes, measuring money demand in real terms is
more convenient. If we divide both sides of Eq. (7.2) by the price level, P, we get
(7.3)
The expression on the left side of Eq. (7.3), M
d
/P, is called real money demand or,
sometimes, the demand for real balances. Real money demand is the amount of
money demanded in terms of the goods it can buy. Equation (7.3) states that real
money demand, M
d
/P, depends on real income (or output), Y, and on the nominal
interest rate, which is the sum of the real interest rate, r, and expected inﬂation, p
e
.
The function L that relates real money demand to output and interest rates in Eq. (7.3)
is called the money demand function.
M
d
P
 =L(Y, r + p
e
).
M

Other Factors Affecting Money Demand
The money demand function in Eq. (7.3) captures the main macroeconomic deter-
minants of money demand, but some other factors should be mentioned. Besides
the nominal interest rate on money, which we have already discussed, additional
factors inﬂuencing money demand include wealth, risk, liquidity of alternative
assets, and payment technologies. Summary table 9 contains a comprehensive list
of variables that affect the demand for money.
Wealth. When wealth increases, part of the extra wealth may be held as money,
increasing total money demand. However, with income and the level of
transactions held constant, a holder of wealth has little incentive to keep extra
wealth in money rather than in higher-return alternative assets. Thus the effect of
an increase in wealth on money demand is likely to be small.
Risk. Money usually pays a ﬁxed nominal interest rate (zero in the case of cash), so
holding money itself usually isn’t risky . However, if the risk of alternative assets such
as stocks and real estate increases greatly , people may demand safer assets, including
money. Thus increased riskiness in the economy may increase money demand.

Business, Autumn 1986, pp. 73–83.

However, money doesn’t always carry a low risk. In a period of erratic inﬂa-
tion, even if the nominal return on money is ﬁxed, the real return on money (the
nominal return minus inﬂation) may become quite uncertain, making money risky.
Money demand then will fall as people switch to inﬂation hedges (assets whose
real returns are less likely to be affected by erratic inﬂation) such as gold, consumer
durable goods, and real estate.
Liquidity of Alternative Assets. The more quickly and easily alternative assets
can be converted into cash, the less need there is to hold money. In recent years
the joint impact of deregulation, competition, and innovation in ﬁnancial markets
has made alternatives to money more liquid. For example, with a home equity
line of credit, a family can now write checks that are backed by the value of its
home. We have mentioned individual cash management accounts whose
introduction allowed individuals to switch wealth easily between high-return
assets, such as stocks, and more liquid forms. As alternative assets become more
liquid, the demand for money declines.
Payment Technologies. Money demand also is affected by the technologies
available for making and receiving payments. For example, the introduction of
credit cards allowed people to make transactions without money—at least until
the end of the month, when a check must be written to pay the credit card bill.
Automatic teller machines (ATMs) probably have reduced the demand for cash
because people know that they can obtain cash quickly whenever they need it. In
the mid 2000s, check clearing became very efﬁcient, thanks to the Check 21 law,
which allowed for electronic clearing of images of checks. This process
greatly reduces the costs of clearing checks and allows them to clear much more
quickly than before. In the future more innovations in payment technologies
undoubtedly will help people operate with less and less cash.
7
Some experts even
predict that ultimately we will live in a “cashless society,” in which almost all
payments will be made through immediately accessible computerized accounting
systems and that the demand for cash will be close to zero.
Elasticities of Money Demand. The theory of portfolio allocation helps
economists identify factors that should affect the aggregate demand for money.
However, for many purposes—such as forecasting and quantitative analyses of
the economy—economists need to know not just which factors affect money
demand but also how strong the various effects are. This information can be
obtained only through statistical analysis of the data.
Over the past three decades, economists have performed hundreds of statisti-
cal studies of the money demand function. The results of these studies often are
expressed in terms of elasticities, which measure the change in money demand
resulting from changes in factors affecting the demand for money. Speciﬁcally, the
income elasticity of money demand is the percentage change in money demand
resulting from a 1% increase in real income. Thus, for example, if the income elas-
ticity of money demand is 2/3, a 3% increase in real income will increase money
7
In 2003, the number of electronic payments exceeded the number of check payments in the United
States for the ﬁrst time. The pace of change is accelerating, as just three years later, the number of elec-
tronic payments was twice the number of check payments. For more, see Geoffrey R. Gerdes, “Recent
Payment Trends in the United States,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, October 2008, pp. A75–A106.
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:48 PM  Page 256
Chapter 7 The Asset Market, Money, and Prices 257
demand by 2% (2/3 : 3% = 2%). Similarly, the interest elasticity of money demand
is the percentage change in money demand resulting from a 1% increase in the
interest rate.
When we work with the interest elasticity of money demand, some care is
needed to avoid a potential pitfall. To illustrate, suppose that the interest rate
increases from 5% per year to 6% per year. To describe this increase in the interest
rate as a 1% increase in the interest rate is tempting (but incorrect). In fact, it is a
20% increase in the interest rate, because 6 is 20% larger than 5.
8
If the interest elas-
ticity of money demand is -0.1, for example, an increase in the interest rate from 5%
to 6% reduces money demand by 2% (-0.1 : 20% =- 2%). Note that, if the interest
elasticity of money demand is negative, as in this example, an increase in the inter-
est rate reduces money demand.
What are the actual values of the income elasticity and interest elasticity of
money demand? Although the many statistical studies of money demand provide
a range of answers, some common results emerge. First, there is widespread agree-
ment that the income elasticity of money demand is positive. For example, in his
classic 1973 study of M1 money demand, which established the framework for
many later studies, Stephen Goldfeld of Princeton University found this elasticity to
be about 2/3.
9
A positive income elasticity of money demand implies that money
demand rises when income rises, as predicted by our theory . Goldfeld’s ﬁnding that
the income elasticity of money demand is less than 1.0 is similar to that of many
other empirical analyses, although some studies have found values for this elastic-
ity as large as 1.0. An income elasticity of money demand smaller than 1.0 implies
that money demand rises less than proportionally with income. Earlier in the chap-
ter we discussed some reasons why, as an individual or nation has higher income,
the demand for money might be expected to grow more slowly than income.
Second, for the interest elasticity of money demand, most studies ﬁnd a small
negative value. For example, Goldfeld found the interest elasticity of money
demand to be about -0.1 or -0.2. A negative value for the interest elasticity of
money demand implies that when interest rates on nonmonetary assets rise, people
reduce their holdings of money, again as predicted by the theory.
Finally, Goldfeld’s study and others have conﬁrmed empirically that the nom-
inal demand for money is proportional to the price level. Again, this result is con-
sistent with the theory, as reﬂected in the money demand equation, Eq. (7.3).
Velocity and the Quantity Theory of Money
A concept related to money demand, which at times is used in discussions of mon-
etary policy, is velocity. It measures how often the money stock “turns over” each
period. Speciﬁcally, velocity is nominal GDP (the price level, P, times real output,
Y) divided by the nominal money stock, M. If we let V represent velocity,
(7.4) V = 
nominal GDP

M
.
8
The change from 5% to 6% can be described as “a one percentage point increase” or as “a twenty
percent increase.”

feld reported elasticities of money demand that applied to the short run and the long run. The ﬁgures
we present here are long-run elasticities.

If velocity rises, each dollar of the money stock is being used in a greater dollar
volume of transactions in each period, if we assume that the volume of transactions
is proportional to GDP. Figure 7.2 shows the M1 and M2 velocities for the United
States from 1959 through the second quarter of 2009.
The concept of velocity comes from one of the earliest theories of money
demand, the quantity theory of money.
10
The quantity theory of money asserts
that real money demand is proportional to real income, or
(7.5)
where M
d
/P is real money demand, Y is real income, and k is a constant. In Eq. (7.5)
the real money demand function, L(Y, r +p
e
), takes the simple form kY. This way of
writing money demand is based on the strong assumption that velocity is a con-
stant, 1/k, and doesn’t depend on income or interest rates.
11
But is velocity actually constant? As Fig. 7.2 shows, M1 velocity clearly is not con-
stant: M1 velocity rose steadily until about 1981, fell sharply in the early 1980s, and has
behaved erratically since then. Financial innovations and foreign demand for dollars
affected velocity at various times since the early 1980s. In the early 1980s, the intro-
duction of interest-bearing checking accounts led to an increase in M1 demand at
any level of GDP and thus a decline in velocity. Later in the decade, low interest

The quantity theory of money was developed by several classical economists, notably Irving Fisher,
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A famous statement of the theory is contained in
Fisher’s book, The Purchasing Power of Money (New York: Macmillan, 1911).
11
To derive velocity under the quantity theory, we must assume that nominal money demand, M
d
,
equals the actual money stock, M, an assumption that we justify later in the chapter. Under this
assumption, you should verify that V = 1/k.

rates on nonmonetary assets raised the demand for M1 at any level of GDP and thus
reduced M1 velocity. In the early 1990s, the breakup of the Soviet Union led to
increased demand for U.S. dollars by foreigners, increasing M1 demand and reduc-
ing velocity. In the mid-1990s, banks developed accounts that were designed to
reduce deposits held in transactions accounts (by transferring funds from checking
accounts to savings accounts overnight), to reduce the reserves they were required
to hold; this reduction in deposits had the effect of reducing M1 at any given level
of GDP , thus increasing M1 velocity. More recently, M1 velocity fell sharply during
the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, both because households increased their holdings of
money and because GDP fell during the recession that began in December 2007.
M2 velocity, also shown in Fig. 7.2, is closer to being constant. It shows no
upward or downward trend and doesn’t exhibit the instability of M1 velocity.
However, even M2 velocity has been somewhat unpredictable over short periods
and most economists would be reluctant to treat M2 velocity as constant.
Throughout the 1990s, people began investing their savings in a broader variety of
ﬁnancial assets than they had before, pulling funds out of bank accounts (which are
included in M2) and investing in bonds and stocks (which are not in M2). As a
result, demand for M2 at any level of GDP was reduced, raising M2 velocity. Fur-
ther, when the housing market was booming from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s,
funds from reﬁnancing of mortgages were temporarily parked in M2 accounts,
leading to increased M2 growth and lower velocity.
Figure 7.3 shows how M1 and M2 growth changed from 1960 to 2009. The graph
shows how the instability in velocity is related to ﬂuctuations in the growth rates of the
monetary aggregates. Of course, these growth rates also reﬂect changes in the supply
of money , not just demand, but you can see speciﬁc episodes, such as the increase in M1
demand in the early 1990s, caused by the surge in foreign demand for U.S. currency.

7.4 Asset Market Equilibrium
Recall that the asset market actually is a set of markets, in which real and ﬁnancial
assets are traded. The demand for any asset (say, government bonds) is the quan-
tity of the asset that holders of wealth want in their portfolios. The demand for each
asset depends on its expected return, risk, liquidity, and time to maturity relative to
other assets. The supply of each asset is the quantity of that asset that is available.
At any particular time the supplies of individual assets are typically ﬁxed, although
over time asset supplies change (the government may issue more bonds, ﬁrms
may issue new shares, more gold may be mined, and so on).
The asset market is in equilibrium when the quantity of each asset that holders
of wealth demand equals the (ﬁxed) available supply of that asset. In this section
we examine asset market equilibrium, focusing on the role of money. We then
show how asset market equilibrium is linked to the price level.
Asset Market Equilibrium: An Aggregation Assumption
In analyzing the labor market in Chapter 3 and the goods market in Chapter 4, we
relied on aggregation to keep things manageable. That is, instead of looking at the
supply and demand for each of the many different types of labor and goods in the
economy, we studied the supply and demand for both labor and goods in general.
Aggregating in this way allowed us to analyze the behavior of the economy as a
whole without getting lost in the details.
Because there are many different types of assets, aggregation is equally neces-
sary for studying the asset market. Thus we adopt an aggregation assumption for
the asset market that economists often make for macroeconomic analysis: We
assume that all assets may be grouped into two categories, money and nonmone-
tary assets. Money includes assets that can be used in payment, such as currency
and checking accounts. All money is assumed to have the same risk and liquidity
and to pay the same nominal interest rate, i
m
. The ﬁxed nominal supply of money
is M. Nonmonetary assets include all assets other than money, such as stocks,
bonds, land, and so on. All nonmonetary assets are assumed to have the same risk
and liquidity and to pay a nominal interest rate of i = r +p
e
, where r is the expect-
ed real interest rate and p
e
is the expected rate of inﬂation. The ﬁxed nominal
supply of nonmonetary assets is NM.
Although the assumption that assets can be aggregated into two types ignores
many interesting differences among assets, it greatly simpliﬁes our analysis and has
proved to be very useful. One immediate beneﬁt of making this assumption is
that, if we allow for only two types of assets, asset market equilibrium reduces to the
condition that the quantity of money supplied equals the quantity of money demanded.
To demonstrate this point, let’s look at the portfolio allocation decision of an
individual named Ed. Ed has a ﬁxed amount of wealth that he allocates between
money and nonmonetary assets. If m
d
is the nominal amount of money and nm
d
is
the nominal amount of nonmonetary assets that Ed wants to hold, the sum of Ed’s
desired money holdings and his desired holdings of nonmonetary assets must be
his total wealth, or
This equation has to be true for every holder of wealth in the economy.

Chapter 7 The Asset Market, Money, and Prices 261
Suppose that we sum this equation across all holders of wealth in the economy.
Then the sum of all individual money demands, m
d
, equals the aggregate demand
for money, M
d
. The sum of all individual demands for nonmonetary assets is the
aggregate demand for nonmonetary assets, NM
d
. Finally, adding nominal wealth
for all holders of wealth gives the aggregate nominal wealth of the economy, or
(7.6)
Equation (7.6) states that the total demand for money in the economy plus the total
demand for nonmonetary assets must equal the economy’s total nominal wealth.
Next, we relate the total supplies of money and nonmonetary assets to aggre-
gate wealth. Because money and nonmonetary assets are the only assets in the
economy, aggregate nominal wealth equals the supply of money, M, plus the
supply of nonmonetary assets, NM, or
(7.7)
Finally, we subtract Eq. (7.7) from Eq. (7.6) to obtain
(7.8)
The term M
d
- M in Eq. (7.8) is the excess demand for money, or the amount by
which the total amount of money demanded exceeds the money supply. Similarly,
the term NM
d
- NM in Eq. (7.8) is the excess demand for nonmonetary assets.
Now suppose that the demand for money, M
d
, equals the money supply, M, so
that the excess demand for money , M
d
- M, is zero. Equation (7.8) shows that, if M
d
-
M is zero, NM
d
- NM must also be zero; that is, if the amounts of money supplied and
demanded are equal, the amounts of nonmonetary assets supplied and demanded
also must be equal. By deﬁnition, if quantities supplied and demanded are equal for
each type of asset, the asset market is in equilibrium.
If we make the simplifying assumption that assets can be lumped into monetary
and nonmonetary categories, the asset market is in equilibrium if the quantity of
money supplied equals the quantity of money demanded. This result is convenient,
because it means that in studying asset market equilibrium we have to look at only
the supply and demand for money and can ignore nonmonetary assets. As long as
the amounts of money supplied and demanded are equal, the entire asset market
will be in equilibrium.
The Asset Market Equilibrium Condition
Equilibrium in the asset market occurs when the quantity of money supplied
equals the quantity of money demanded. This condition is valid whether money
supply and demand are expressed in nominal terms or real terms. We work with
this condition in real terms, or
(7.9)
The left side of Eq. (7.9) is the nominal supply of money, M, divided by the
price level, P, which is the supply of money measured in real terms. The right side
of the equation is the same as the real demand for money, M
d
/P, as in Eq. (7.3).
Equation (7.9), which states that the real quantity of money supplied equals the real
quantity of money demanded, is called the asset market equilibrium condition.

262 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
The asset market equilibrium condition involves ﬁve variables: the nominal money
supply, M; the price level, P; real income, Y; the real interest rate, r; and the expect-
ed rate of inﬂation, p
e
. The nominal money supply, M, is determined by the central
bank through its open-market operations. For now, we treat the expected rate of
inﬂation, p
e
, as ﬁxed (we return to the determination of expected inﬂation later in
the chapter). That leaves three variables in the asset market equilibrium condition
whose values we haven’t yet speciﬁed: output, Y; the real interest rate, r; and the
price level, P.
In this part of the book we have made the assumption that the economy is at
full employment or, equivalently, that all markets are in equilibrium. Both classical
and Keynesian economists agree that the full-employment assumption is reason-
able for analyzing the long-term behavior of the economy. If we continue to assume
full employment,

we can use the analysis from previous chapters to describe
how output and the real interest rate are determined. Recall from Chapter 3 that, if
the labor market is in equilibrium—with employment at its full-employment
level—output equals full-employment output, . In Chapter 4 we showed that, for
any level of output, the real interest rate in a closed economy must take the value
that makes desired national saving and desired investment equal (the goods
market equilibrium condition).
With the values of output and the real interest rate established by equilibrium
in the labor and goods markets, the only variable left to be determined by the
asset market equilibrium condition is the price level, P. To emphasize that the price
level is the variable determined by asset market equilibrium, we multiply both
sides of Eq. (7.9) by P and divide both sides by real money demand, L(Y, r + p
e
), to
obtain
(7.10)
According to Eq. (7.10), the economy’s price level, P, equals the ratio of the
nominal money supply, M, to the real demand for money, L(Y, r +p
e
). For given
values of real output, Y, the real interest rate, r, and the expected rate of inﬂation, p
e
,
the real demand for money, L(Y, r +p
e
), is ﬁxed. Thus Eq. (7.10) states that the price
level is proportional to the nominal money supply. A doubling of the nominal
money supply, M, for instance, would double the price level, P, with other factors
held constant. The existence of a close link between the price level and the money
supply in an economy is one of the oldest and most reliable conclusions about
macroeconomic behavior, having been recognized in some form for hundreds if not
thousands of years. We discuss the empirical support for this link in Section 7.5.
What forces lead the price level to its equilibrium value, Eq. (7.10)? A complete
description of how the price level adjusts to its equilibrium value involves an
analysis of the goods market as well as the asset market; we leave this task until
Chapter 9, where we discuss the links among the three main markets of the econ-
omy in more detail. Brieﬂy, in Chapter 9 we show that an increase in the money
supply leads people to increase their nominal spending on goods and services; this
increased nominal demand for output leads prices to rise. Prices continue to rise
until people are content to hold the increased nominal quantity of money in their
portfolios, satisfying the asset market equilibrium condition (rewritten as Eq. 7.10).

Chapter 7 The Asset Market, Money, and Prices 263
7.5 Money Growth and Inflation
In Section 7.4 we established that, when the markets for labor, goods, and assets
are all in equilibrium, the price level, P, is proportional to the nominal money
supply, M. However, the price level itself generally is of less concern to policy-
makers and the public than is the rate of inflation, or the percentage rate of
increase of the price level. In this section we extend our analysis of the price level
to show how inﬂation is determined. We conclude that the inﬂation rate, which is
the growth rate of the price level, is closely related to the growth rate of the nom-
inal money supply.
To obtain an equation for the rate of inﬂation, we set the growth rate of the left
side of Eq. (7.10) equal to the growth rate of its right side to obtain
(7.11)
where the symbol ≤ indicates the change in a variable from one year to the next.
The left side of Eq. (7.11) is the growth rate of the price level, ≤P/P, which is the
same as the inﬂation rate, p. The right side of Eq. (7.11) expresses the growth rate
of the ratio on the right side of Eq. (7.10) as the growth rate of the numerator, M,
minus the growth rate of the denominator, L(Y, r +p
e
). (In Appendix A, Section A.7,
we provide some useful formulas for calculating growth rates.) Equation (7.11)
shows that, if the asset market is in equilibrium, the rate of inﬂation equals the growth
rate of the nominal money supply minus the growth rate of real money demand.
Equation (7.11) highlights the point that the rate of inﬂation is closely related to
the rate of growth of the nominal money supply . However, to use Eq. (7.11) to predict
the behavior of inﬂation we must also know how quickly real money demand is
growing. The money demand function, Eq. (7.3), focused on two macroeconomic
variables with signiﬁcant effects on real money demand: income (or output), Y, and
the nominal interest rate, r+p
e
. We show later in this section that, in a long-run equi-
librium with a constant growth rate of money, the nominal interest rate will be con-
stant. Therefore here we look only at growth in income as a source of growth in real
money demand.
Earlier we deﬁned the income elasticity of money demand to be the percentage
change in money demand resulting from a 1% increase in real income. If ≤Y/Y is
the percentage change in real income from one year to the next and h
Y
is the
income elasticity of money demand, h
Y
≤Y/Y is the resulting increase in the real
demand for money, with other factors affecting money demand held constant.
Substituting p for ≤P/P and h
Y
≤Y/Y for the growth rate of real money demand in
Eq. (7.11) yields
(7.12)
Equation (7.12) is a useful simple expression for the rate of inﬂation. According to
Eq. (7.12), the rate of inﬂation equals the growth rate of the nominal money supply
minus an adjustment for the growth rate of real money demand arising from
growth in real output. For example, suppose that nominal money supply growth is
10% per year, real income is growing by 3% per year, and the income elasticity of
money demand is 2/3. Then Eq. (7.12) predicts that the inﬂation rate will be 10% –
(2/3)(3%), or 8% per year.

264 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
APPLICATION
Money Growth and Inflation in European Countries in Transition
The fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the breakup of the Soviet Union led
to economic, political, and social upheaval. All of these countries, to varying
degrees, have introduced reforms intended to make their economies more market-
oriented, and many (particularly the new countries formed from the breakup of the
Soviet Union) have introduced new currencies. However, Russia and many of the
Eastern European economies continued to face serious problems, including very
high rates of inﬂation. The main reason for the high inﬂation rates is the rapid rates
of money growth in these countries.
In general, both the growth of the nominal money supply and the growth of
real money demand (resulting from real income growth, for example) affect the
rate of inflation (see Eq. 7.12). In countries with high inflation, however, the
growth of the nominal money supply usually is the much more important of these
two factors. To illustrate, if the income elasticity of money demand in a country is
2/3, and real output were to grow at the stunning rate of 15% per year, then in Eq.
(7.12) real money demand would grow at 10% per year (2/3   15%) in that coun-
try. If a second country also has an income elasticity of 2/3, but its income is
falling at the painful rate of 15% per year, the rate of growth of real money
demand is -10% per year. Thus even with these radically different income growth
rates, the difference in the growth rates of real money demand is only 20 percent-
age points per year.
In contrast to the relatively modest differences among countries in the growth
rates of real money demand, rates of growth of nominal money supplies may vary
among countries by hundreds of percentage points per year. Thus large differ-
ences in inﬂation rates among countries almost always are the result of large dif-
ferences in rates of money growth.
The link between the money growth rate and the inﬂation rate is illustrated
in Fig. 7.4, which shows the average annual values of these rates during the
period 1995–2001 for the European countries designated by the International
Monetary Fund as “countries in transition.” Most of these countries were in the
process of moving from communism to free-market capitalism. The three coun-
tries that had inﬂation rates that averaged more than 80% per year during this
period—Belarus, Turkey, and Bulgaria—also had money growth rates that aver-
aged more than 80% per year. Whether we compare inﬂation rates among these
three countries or compare the high inﬂation rates of these three countries with
the relatively low inﬂation rates of the remaining sixteen countries, large differ-
ences in inﬂation rates clearly are associated with large differences in rates of
money growth.
If rapid money growth causes inflation, why do countries allow their
money supplies to grow so quickly? As we discussed earlier, governments
sometimes find that printing money (borrowing from the central bank) is the
only way that they can finance their expenditures. This situation is most likely
to occur in poor countries or countries that undergo economic upheavals asso-
ciated with war, natural disaster, or (as in the case of the European countries in
transition) major political and economic change. Unfortunately, the almost
inevitable result of financing government expenditures in this way is increased
inflation.
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:48 PM  Page 264
The Expected Inflation Rate and the Nominal Interest Rate
In our earlier discussion of asset market equilibrium, we made the assumption that the
expected inﬂation rate is ﬁxed. For a given real interest rate, r (which is determined by
the goods market equilibrium condition), if the expected inﬂation rate, p
e
, is ﬁxed, so
is the nominal interest rate, at r +p
e
. We close the chapter with a brief look at the
factors that determine the expected inﬂation rate and the nominal interest rate.
What should holders of wealth and others expect the inﬂation rate to be in the
future? As we demonstrated, Eq. (7.12), which relates inﬂation to the growth rates of the
nominal money supply and real income, is useful for predicting inﬂation. For expect-
ed values of money growth (based, for example, on plans announced by the central
bank) and real income growth, as well as an estimate of the income elasticity of money
demand, Eq. (7.12) can be used to calculate the expected inﬂation rate. Suppose that
people in a particular country expect their nation’s money supply to grow much more
rapidly over the next two years because the government is committed to large military
expenditures and can pay for these expenditures only by printing money. In this case,
Eq. (7.12) shows that people should expect much higher inﬂation rates in the future.
The inﬂation prediction equation, Eq. (7.12), is particularly easy to apply when the
growth rates of the nominal money supply and real income are constant over time. In
this case, the expected growth rates of the nominal money supply and real income equal
their current growth rates, and (from Eq. 7.12) the expected inﬂation rate equals the cur-
rent inﬂation rate (assuming no change in the income elasticity of money demand). In
practice, the current inﬂation rate often approximates the expected inﬂation rate, as long
as people don’t expect money or income growth to change too much in the near future.

266 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
The public’s expected inﬂation rate is not directly observable, except perhaps
through surveys and similar methods. However, an observable economic variable that
is strongly affected by expected inﬂation is the nominal interest rate. At any real inter-
est rate, r, which is determined by the goods market equilibrium condition that
desired national saving equals desired investment, the nominal interest rate, r +p
e
,
changes one-for-one with changes in the expected inﬂation rate, p
e
. Thus policy
actions (such as rapid expansion of the money supply) that cause people to fear future
increases in inﬂation should cause nominal interest rates to rise, all else being equal.
But, as already noted, if people don’t expect large changes in the growth rates
of the money supply or real income, expected inﬂation won’t be much different
from current inﬂation. In this case, nominal interest rates and current inﬂation
rates should move together. If current inﬂation is high, for example, expected inﬂa-
tion also is likely to be high; but high expected inﬂation also causes nominal inter-
est rates to be high, all else being equal.
The historical relationship between nominal interest rates and inﬂation is illus-
trated by Fig. 7.5, which shows monthly data on the nominal interest rate on one-year
Treasury bills and the twelve-month inﬂation rate measured by the consumer price
index in the United States from January 1960 to July 2009. The nominal interest rate
and the inﬂation rate have tended to move together, rising during the 1960s and
1970s and then falling sharply after reaching a peak in the early 1980s. However,
movements in the inﬂation rate aren’t perfectly matched by movements in the nom-
inal interest rate because the real interest rate hasn’t been constant over this period.
In particular, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the rise in the nominal interest
rate was much greater than the rise in the inﬂation rate, reﬂecting an increase in the
real interest rate from a negative value in the mid 1970s to much higher, positive
values in the 1980s. (See Fig. 2.3, p. 52, for a graph of the real interest rate.)

APPLICATION
Measuring Inflation Expectations
Equilibrium in the asset market depends on people’s expectations for the inﬂation
rate. But how do people form expectations of inﬂation? They may do so by looking
at surveys of economists who specialize in forecasting the economy.
13
If so, we can
gather information about people’s long-term inﬂation expectations from surveys
that ask people what they think inﬂation will be in the long run, such as the Survey
of Professional Forecasters or the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers.
However, survey information may be unreliable if the people surveyed do not have
a strong stake in understanding the determinants of the inﬂation rate. On the other
hand, people who purchase bonds are more likely to care about inﬂation, because a
change in the inﬂation rate affects the real return on their investments. So data from
ﬁnancial markets can reveal investors’ expectations about the rate of inﬂation.
14
The U.S. government borrows from the public by issuing nominal bonds and
(since 1997) by issuing Treasury Inﬂation-Protected Securities (TIPS). Nominal bonds
offer a certain nominal interest rate over the life of the bond, but the real rate of inter-
est on nominal bonds depends on the rate of inﬂation during the life of the bond. The
expected real interest rate on the nominal bond is (recall Eq. 2.13) , where
i is the nominal interest rate and p
e
is the expected rate of inﬂation during the life of
the bond. TIPS bonds offer a certain real interest rate over the life of the bond, regard-
less of the rate of inﬂation that occurs during the life of the bond. TIPS bonds insulate
the real rate of return from ﬂuctuations in the rate of inﬂation by adjusting both the
interest payments and the principal repayments of the bonds.
Figure 7.6 shows the nominal interest rate on nominal bonds and the real inter-
est rate on TIPS bonds. The real interest rate on ten-year TIPS bonds trended
upward from 3.3% in early 1997 to 4.3% in early 2000. Beginning in 2000, the real
interest rate generally trended down, falling to 1.6% in early 2005. From mid 2005
to mid 2007, the real interest rate increased somewhat. The real interest rate then
fell during the recession that began in late 2007, except for a short-lived upward
spike during the ﬁnancial crisis in late 2008.
If nominal bonds and TIPS bonds were equally risky and equally liquid, then
equilibrium in the asset market would imply that the expected real interest rate on
nominal bonds, , would equal the real interest rate on TIPS bonds, r
TIPS
. Setting
equal to r
TIPS
implies that p
e
= i - r
TIPS
. Thus, the excess of the nominal inter-
est rate over the TIPS rate, i - r
TIPS
, which we will call the interest rate differential, pro-
vides a rough measure of expected inﬂation. However, because the risk to investors
from unpredictable ﬂuctuations in inﬂation is eliminated by the TIPS bond, some of
the difference between the two rates is attributable to inﬂation risk rather than to
expected inﬂation. That is, investors who buy nominal bonds know that they face
greater risk from unpredictable changes in inﬂation than they would if they were to
buy TIPS bonds, so the interest rate on nominal bonds is higher to compensate
holders of nominal bonds for bearing that risk. On the other hand, the market for

TIPS bonds is less liquid (that is, has fewer buyers and sellers), so the interest rate on
TIPS bonds is higher than it would be if they were sold in a more liquid market. With
these two conﬂicting effects, it is not clear whether the interest rate differential shown
in Fig. 7.6 overstates or understates the expected inﬂation rate over the next ten
years. However, these two effects are likely to be small, and they work in opposite
directions, so their net effect is likely to be very small. Therefore, we will use the inﬂa-
tion rate differential as a measure of people’s expected rate of inﬂation.
Figure 7.7 plots the inﬂation rate differential over time (the gap between the
lines in Fig. 7.6). The graph suggests that people’s expectations of inﬂation declined
in 1997 and 1998, rose in 1999, fell slightly in 2000, remained roughly constant in 2001
and 2002, rose in 2003, were stable from 2004 to early 2008, and then declined sharply
in the ﬁnancial crisis that began in 2008.
15
This ﬂuctuating behavior is in contrast to
the smooth behavior of a survey measure of expected inﬂation, also shown in Fig. 7.7,
from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. The survey measure of expected inﬂa-
tion fell from 3% in 1997 to 2.5% in 1998 and remained at about 2.5% throughout the
period. It appears that professional forecasters did not change their views very much
about expected inﬂation over the next ten years. However, market participants seem
to have had much more volatile views on expected inﬂation, or else the degree of
inﬂation risk and liquidity in the TIPS market ﬂuctuated substantially in this period.
15
Some observers explain the decline in the interest differential that occurred late in 2008 as the conse-
quence of reduced liquidity of TIPS relative to conventional bonds issued by the Federal government.
The perception that TIPS had become less liquid meant that investors required a higher expected rate
of return on TIPS relative to the expected return on conventional bonds, thereby narrowing the differ-
ential between the interest rates on conventional bonds and on TIPS.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. Money is the set of assets that are widely used and
accepted as payment, such as currency and checking
accounts. Money functions as a medium of exchange,
a unit of account, and a store of value.
2. The supply of money is set by the central bank—the
Federal Reserve System in the United States. The cen-
tral bank’s ofﬁcial measures of money are called the
monetary aggregates. M1 is made up primarily of
currency and checking accounts and M2 includes a
broader set of monetary assets.
3. A portfolio allocation decision is made by a holder of
wealth when determining how much of each asset
to hold. The characteristics of assets that most affect
their desirability are expected return, risk, liquidity,
and, for financial securities, time to maturity. The
major assets that people hold are money, bonds,
stocks, houses, and consumer durable goods.
4. Money demand is the total amount of money that
people choose to hold in their portfolios. The princi-
pal macroeconomic variables that affect money
demand are the price level, real income, and interest
rates. Nominal money demand is proportional to the
price level. Higher real income increases the number
of transactions and thus raises real money demand. A
higher interest rate on alternative, nonmonetary
assets lowers real money demand by making the
alternative assets more attractive relative to money.
The money demand function measures the relation-
ship between real money demand and these macro-
economic variables.
5. Velocity is the ratio of nominal GDP to the nominal
money stock. The quantity theory of money is an
early theory of money demand based on the assump-
tion that velocity is constant, so that money demand
is proportional to income. Historically, M2 velocity
has been more stable than M1 velocity, although even
M2 velocity isn’t constant.
6. Under the simplifying assumption that assets can be
grouped into two categories—money and nonmone-
tary assets—the asset market is in equilibrium if the
M07_ABEL4529_07_SE_C07.QXD  12/9/09  3:48 PM  Page 269
270 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
quantity of money supplied equals the quantity of
money demanded. When all markets are in equilibri-
um (the economy is at full employment), the level of
output is determined by equilibrium in the labor
market, the real interest rate is determined by equi-
librium in the goods market, and the price level is
determined by equilibrium in the asset market. The
equilibrium price level is proportional to the nominal
money supply.
7. The inﬂation rate equals the growth rate of the nom-
inal money supply minus the growth rate of real
money demand. The growth rate of real money
demand in turn depends primarily on the real
income growth rate. Expected inﬂation depends on
expected growth rates of the nominal money supply
and real income. For a given real interest rate, the
nominal interest rate responds one-for-one to
changes in expected inﬂation.

KEY EQUATIONS
(7.3)
According to the money demand function, the real quanti-
ty of money demanded, M
d
/P, depends on output and the
nominal interest rate on alternative, nonmonetary assets.
An increase in output, Y, raises the number of transactions
people make and thus raises the demand for money. An
increase in the nominal interest rate on nonmonetary
assets, i (which equals the expected real interest rate, r, plus
the expected rate of inﬂation, p
e
) raises the attractiveness of
alternative assets and thus reduces the demand for money .

The inflation rate, p, equals the growth rate of the nom-

NUMERICAL PROBLEMS
All numerical problems are available in
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. Suppose the interest rate on a one-year bond today is
6% per year, the interest rate on a one-year bond one
year from now is expected to be 4% per year, and the
interest rate on a one-year bond two years from now is
expected to be 3% per year. The term premium on a
two-year bond is 0.5% per year and the term premium
on a three-year bond is 1.0% per year. In equilibrium,
what is the interest rate today on a two-year bond? On
a three-year bond? What is the shape of the yield
curve?
2. Money demand in an economy in which no interest is
paid on money is
a. Suppose that P = 100, Y = 1000, and i = 0.10. Find
real money demand, nominal money demand, and
velocity.
b. The price level doubles from P = 100 to P = 200.
Find real money demand, nominal money
demand, and velocity.
M
d
P
 = 500 + 0.2Y - 1000i.
c. Starting from the values of the variables given in
Part (a) and assuming that the money demand
function as written holds, determine how velocity
is affected by an increase in real income, by an
increase in the nominal interest rate, and by an
increase in the price level.
3. Mr. Midas has wealth of $100,000 that he invests entire-
ly in money (a checking account) and government
bonds. Mr. Midas instructs his broker to invest $50,000 in
bonds, plus $5000 more in bonds for every percentage
point that the interest rate on bonds exceeds the interest
rate on his checking account.
a. Write an algebraic formula that gives Mr. Midas’s
demand for money as a function of bond and
checking account interest rates.
b. Write an algebraic formula that gives Mr. Midas’s
demand for bonds. What is the sum of his demand
for money and his demand for bonds?
c. Suppose that all holders of wealth in the economy
are identical to Mr. Midas. Fixed asset supplies per
person are $80,000 of bonds and $20,000 of check-
ing accounts. Checking accounts pay no interest.
What is the interest rate on bonds in asset market
equilibrium?
REVIEW QUESTIONS
All review questions are available in
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. Deﬁne money. How does the economist’s use of this term
differ from its everyday meaning?
2. What are the three functions of money? How does each
function contribute to a more smoothly operating
economy?
3. Who determines the nation’s money supply? Explain
how the money supply could be expanded or reduced
in an economy in which all money is in the form of
currency.
4. What are the four characteristics of assets that are most
important to holders of wealth? How does money
compare with other assets for each characteristic?
5. Describe what is meant by the expectations theory of
the term structure of interest rates. Why isn’t the
expectations theory sufﬁcient to describe the data on
interest rates that we observe? What must be added to
the expectations theory to form a more accurate
theory?

condition that real money supply equal real money
demand? What aggregation assumption is needed to
allow ignoring the markets for other assets?
9. What is the relationship between the price level and the
nominal money supply? What is the relationship
between inﬂation and the growth rate of the nominal
money supply?
10. Give an example of a factor that would increase the
public’s expected rate of inﬂation. All else being equal,
how would this increase in the expected inﬂation rate

272 Part 2 Long-Run Economic Performance
4. Assume that the quantity theory of money holds and
that velocity is constant at 5. Output is ﬁxed at its full-
employment value of 10,000, and the price level is 2.
a. Determine the real demand for money and the
nominal demand for money.
b. In this same economy the government fixes the
nominal money supply at 5000. With output ﬁxed
at its full-employment level and with the assump-
tion that prices are ﬂexible, what will be the new
price level? What happens to the price level if the
nominal money supply rises to 6000?
5. Consider an economy with a constant nominal money
supply , a constant level of real output Y = 100, and a con-
stant real interest rate r = 0.10. Suppose that the income
elasticity of money demand is 0.5 and the interest elas-
ticity of money demand is -0.1.
a. By what percentage does the equilibrium price level
differ from its initial value if output increases to Y =
106 (and r remains at 0.10)? (Hint: Use Eq. 7.11.)
b. By what percentage does the equilibrium price
level differ from its initial value if the real interest
increases to r = 0.11 (and Y remains at 100)?
c. Suppose that the real interest rate increases to r =
0.11. What would real output have to be for the
equilibrium price level to remain at its initial value?
6. Suppose that the real money demand function is
where Y is real output, r is the real interest rate, and p
e
is
the expected rate of inﬂation. Real output is constant
L(Y,r + p
e
) = 
0.01Y
r + p

 ,
over time at Y = 150. The real interest rate is ﬁxed in the
goods market at r = 0.05 per year.
a. Suppose that the nominal money supply is grow-
ing at the rate of 10% per year and that this
growth rate is expected to persist forever. Cur-
rently, the nominal money supply is M = 300.
What are the values of the real money supply and
the current price level? (Hint: What is the value of
the expected inﬂation rate that enters the money
demand function?)
b. Suppose that the nominal money supply is M =
300. The central bank announces that from now on
the nominal money supply will grow at the rate of
5% per year. If everyone believes this announce-
ment, and if all markets are in equilibrium, what
are the values of the real money supply and the
current price level? Explain the effects on the real
money supply and the current price level of a slow-
down in the rate of money growth.
7. The income elasticity of money demand is 2/3 and the
interest elasticity of money demand is -0.1. Real income
is expected to grow by 4.5% over the next year, and the
real interest rate is expected to remain constant over
the next year. The rate of inﬂation has been zero for
several years.
a. If the central bank wants zero inﬂation over the
next year, what growth rate of the nominal money
supply should it choose?
b. By how much will velocity change over the next
year if the central bank follows the policy that
achieves zero inﬂation?

can be written on money market mutual funds and
money market deposit accounts is raised from
three to thirty.
b. Home equity lines of credit that allow homeowners
to write checks against the value of their homes are
introduced.
c. The stock market crashes, and further sharp
declines in the market are widely feared.
d. Banks introduce overdraft protection, under

ings to checking as needed to cover checks.
e. A crackdown reduces the illegal drug trade (which
is carried out largely in currency).
2. Figure 7.2 shows that, before the 1980s, M1 velocity gen-
erally rose over time. Suggest some explanations for this
upward trend.
3. The prisoner-of-war camp described by Radford ("In
Touch with Data and Research: Money in a Prisoner-
of-War Camp," p.238) periodically received large
shipments of cigarettes from the Red Cross or other
sources.

(the prices of goods in terms of cigarettes) in the
POW camp?

WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. Graph the current yield curve (see the section, “Time to
Maturity,” p. 245 and the graph of the yield curve on
p. 115), plotting the interest rate on bonds with different
maturities against their time to maturity, using
data from the Federal Reserve’s H.15 release
(www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15). Use the Fed’s “con-
stant maturity” series of rates, which are designed for
this purpose. Then look at the H.15 release from one
year earlier and plot the yield curve for that date as well.
What has happened to the term structure of interest
rates over the past year? What economic events do you
think have led to this change?
2. Graph the CPI inﬂation rate, M1 money growth, and
M2 money growth for the United States, using annual
data since 1959. (Find annual growth rates for December
to December.) Also graph the three-year average rate
of inﬂation and the three-year averages of M1 growth
and M2 growth, starting with 1961. (The three-year
average rate of inﬂation for, say, 1978 is the average of
the inﬂation rates in 1976, 1977, and 1978. Similarly,
the three-year average money growth rate for 1978 is
the average of the money growth rates for 1976, 1977,
and 1978.)
Is the inflation rate more closely related to M1
growth or M2 growth? Is the relationship of inﬂation to
money growth stronger in the short run (in annual data)
or in the longer run (using three-year averages)? What
has happened to the link between inﬂation and money
growth during the past decade?
3. Graph the three-month Treasury bill interest rate, the
ten-year government bond interest rate, and the CPI
inﬂation rate on the same ﬁgure, using data since 1961.
Make sure that the units are comparable.
a. In general, how are changes in interest rates related
to changes in inﬂation? Why?
b. Is the three-month rate or the ten-year rate more
sensitive to current changes in inﬂation? Give an
economic explanation.
b. (More difﬁcult) On some occasions the prisoners
knew in advance when the cigarette shipments
were to arrive. What happened to the demand for
cigarette money and the price level in the camp in
the days just before an anticipated shipment?
4. Assume that prices and wages adjust rapidly so that
the markets for labor, goods, and assets are always
in equilibrium. What are the effects of each of the
following on output, the real interest rate, and the
current price level?
a. A temporary increase in government purchases.
b. A reduction in expected inﬂation.
c. A temporary increase in labor supply.
d. An increase in the interest rate paid on money.

CHAPTER 8
Business Cycles
Since the Industrial Revolution, the economies of the United States and many other
countries have grown tremendously. That growth has transformed economies and
greatly improved living standards. Yet even in prosperous countries, economic expan-
sion has been periodically interrupted by episodes of declining production and
income and rising unemployment. Sometimes—fortunately, not very often—these
episodes have been severe and prolonged. But whether brief or more extended,
declines in economic activity have been followed almost invariably by a resumption
of economic growth.
This repeated sequence of economic expansion giving way to temporary
decline followed by recovery, is known as the business cycle. The business cycle
is a central concern in macroeconomics because business cycle fluctuations—the
ups and downs in overall economic activity—are felt throughout the economy.
When the economy is growing strongly, prosperity is shared by most of the
nation’s industries and their workers and owners of capital. When the economy
weakens, many sectors of the economy experience declining sales and produc-
tion, and workers are laid off or forced to work only part-time. Because the
effects of business cycles are so widespread, and because economic downturns
can cause great hardship, economists have tried to find the causes of these
episodes and to determine what, if anything, can be done to counteract them.
The two basic questions of (1) what causes business cycles and (2) how policy-
makers should respond to cyclical fluctuations are the main concern of Part 3 of
this book.
The answers to these two questions remain highly controversial. Much of this
controversy involves the proponents of the classical and Keynesian approaches to
macroeconomics, introduced in Chapter 1. In brief, classical economists view busi-
ness cycles as generally representing the economy’s best response to disturbances
in production or spending. Thus classical economists do not see much, if any, need
for government action to counteract these ﬂuctuations. In contrast, Keynesian econ-
omists argue that, because wages and prices adjust slowly, disturbances in pro-
duction or spending may drive the economy away from its most desirable level of
output and employment for long periods of time. According to the Keynesian
view, government should intervene to smooth business cycle ﬂuctuations.
We explore the debate between classicals and Keynesians, and the implications
of that debate for economic analysis and macroeconomic policy, in Chapters 9–11.
In this chapter we provide essential background for that discussion by presenting
the basic features of the business cycle. We begin with a deﬁnition and a brief his-
tory of the business cycle in the United States. We then turn to a more detailed
M08_ABEL4529_07_SE_C08.QXD  12/9/09  3:50 PM  Page 274
Chapter 8 Business Cycles 275
discussion of business cycle characteristics, or “business cycle facts.” We conclude
the chapter with a brief preview of the alternative approaches to the analysis of
business cycles.
8.1 What Is a Business Cycle?
Countries have experienced ups and downs in overall economic activity since they
began to industrialize. Economists have measured and studied these ﬂuctuations
for more than a century. Marx and Engels referred to “commercial crises,” an early
term for business cycles, in their Communist Manifesto in 1848. In the United
States, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private nonproﬁt
organization of economists founded in 1920, pioneered business cycle research. The
NBER developed and continues to update the business cycle chronology, a
detailed history of business cycles in the United States and other countries. The
NBER has also sponsored many studies of the business cycle: One landmark study
was the 1946 book Measuring Business Cycles, by Arthur Burns (who served as Fed-
eral Reserve chairman from 1970 until 1978) and Wesley Mitchell (a principal
founder of the NBER). This work was among the ﬁrst to document and analyze the
empirical facts about business cycles. It begins with the following deﬁnition:
Business cycles are a type of ﬂuctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of
nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises. A cycle consists of ex-
pansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by
similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expan-
sion phase of the next cycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic; in
duration business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years.
1
Five points in this deﬁnition should be clariﬁed and emphasized.
1. Aggregate economic activity. Business cycles are deﬁned broadly as ﬂuctua-
tions of “aggregate economic activity” rather than as ﬂuctuations in a single, spe-
ciﬁc economic variable such as real GDP. Although real GDP may be the single
variable that most closely measures aggregate economic activity, Burns and
Mitchell also thought it important to look at other indicators of activity, such as
employment and ﬁnancial market variables.
2. Expansions and contractions. Figure 8.1—a diagram of a typical business
cycle—helps explain what Burns and Mitchell meant by expansions and contrac-
tions. The dashed line shows the average, or normal, growth path of aggregate
economic activity, as determined by the factors we considered in Chapter 6. The
solid curve shows the rises and falls of actual economic activity. The period of
time during which aggregate economic activity is falling is a contraction or
recession. If the recession is particularly severe, it becomes a depression. After
reaching the low point of the contraction, the trough (T), aggregate economic
activity begins to increase. The period of time during which aggregate economic
activity grows is an expansion or a boom. After reaching the high point of the
expansion, the peak (P), aggregate economic activity begins to decline again. The

entire sequence of decline followed by recovery, measured from peak to peak or
trough to trough, is a business cycle.
Figure 8.1 suggests that business cycles are purely temporary deviations from
the economy’s normal growth path. However, part of the output losses and gains
that occur during a business cycle may become permanent.
Peaks and troughs in the business cycle are known collectively as turning
points. One goal of business cycle research is to identify when turning points
occur. Aggregate economic activity isn’t measured directly by any single variable,
so there’s no simple formula that tells economists when a peak or trough has been
reached.
2
In practice, a small group of economists who form the NBER’s Business
Cycle Dating Committee determine that date. The committee meets only when its
members believe that a turning point may have occurred. By examining a variety
of economic data, the committee determines whether a peak or trough has been
reached and, if so, the month it happened. However, the committee’s announce-
ments usually come well after a peak or trough occurs, so their judgments are
more useful for historical analysis of business cycles than as a guide to current
policymaking.
3. Comovement. Business cycles do not occur in just a few sectors or in just a few
economic variables. Instead, expansions or contractions “occur at about the same
time in many economic activities.” Thus, although some industries are more sensitive
to the business cycle than others, output and employment in most industries tend to
2
A conventional deﬁnition used by the media—that a recession has occurred when there are two con-
secutive quarters of negative real GDP growth—isn’t widely accepted by economists. The reason that
economists tend not to like this deﬁnition is that real GDP is only one of many possible indicators of
economic activity.
M08_ABEL4529_07_SE_C08.QXD  12/9/09  3:50 PM  Page 276
Chapter 8 Business Cycles 277
fall in recessions and rise in expansions. Many other economic variables, such as
prices, productivity, investment, and government purchases, also have regular and
predictable patterns of behavior over the course of the business cycle. The tendency
of many economic variables to move together in a predictable way over the business
cycle is called comovement.
4. Recurrent but not periodic. The business cycle isn’t periodic, in that it does not
occur at regular, predictable intervals and doesn’t last for a ﬁxed or predetermined
length of time. (“In Touch with Data and Research: The Seasonal Cycle and the
Business Cycle,” p. 301, discusses the seasonal cycle—or economic ﬂuctuations over
the seasons of the year—which, unlike the business cycle, is periodic.) Although the
business cycle isn’t periodic, it is recurrent; that is, the standard pattern of contrac-
tion–trough–expansion–peak recurs again and again in industrial economies.
5. Persistence. The duration of a complete business cycle can vary greatly,
from about a year to more than a decade, and predicting it is extremely difﬁcult.
However, once a recession begins, the economy tends to keep contracting for a
period of time, perhaps for a year or more. Similarly, an expansion, once begun,
usually lasts a while. This tendency for declines in economic activity to be fol-
lowed by further declines, and for growth in economic activity to be followed by
more growth, is called persistence. Because movements in economic activity have
some persistence, economic forecasters are always on the lookout for turning
points, which are likely to indicate a change in the direction of economic activity.
8.2 The American Business Cycle: The Historical Record
An overview of American business cycle history is provided by the NBER’s monthly
business cycle chronology,
3
as summarized in Table 8.1. It gives the dates of the
troughs and peaks of the thirty-two complete business cycles that the U.S. economy
has experienced since 1854. Also shown is the number of months that each contraction
and expansion lasted.
The Pre–World War I Period
The period between the Civil War (1861–1865) and World War I (1917–1918) was
one of rapid economic growth in the United States. Nevertheless, as Table 8.1
shows, recessions were a serious problem during that time. Indeed, the longest con-
traction on record is the 65-month-long decline between October 1873 and March
1879, a contraction that was worldwide in scope and is referred to by economic his-
torians as the Depression of the 1870s. Overall, during the 1854–1914 period the
economy suffered 338 months of contraction, or nearly as many as the 382 months
of expansion. In contrast, from the end of World War II in 1945 through December
2007, the number of months of expansion (642) outnumbered months of contraction
(104) by more than six to one.

The Great Depression and World War II
The worst economic contraction in the history of the United States was the Great
Depression of the 1930s. After a prosperous decade in the 1920s, aggregate eco-
nomic activity reached a peak in August 1929, two months before the stock market
crash in October 1929. Between the 1929 peak and the 1933 trough, real GDP fell by
nearly 30%. During the same period the unemployment rate rose from about 3% to
nearly 25%, with many of those lucky enough to have jobs only able to work part-
time. To appreciate how severe the Great Depression was, compare it with the two
worst post–World War II recessions of 1973–1975 and 1981–1982. In contrast to the
30% real GDP decline and 25% unemployment rate of the Great Depression, in the
1973–1975 recession real GDP fell by 3.4% and the unemployment rate rose from
M08_ABEL4529_07_SE_C08.QXD  12/9/09  3:50 PM  Page 278
Chapter 8 Business Cycles 279
about 4% to about 9%; in the 1981–1982 recession real GDP fell by 2.8% and the
unemployment rate rose from about 7% to about 11%.
Although no sector escaped the Great Depression, some were particularly hard
hit. In the ﬁnancial sector, stock prices continued to collapse after the crash. Depos-
itors withdrew their money from banks, and borrowers, unable to repay their bank
loans, were forced to default; as a result, thousands of banks were forced to go out
of business or merge with other banks. In agriculture, farmers were bankrupted by
low crop prices, and a prolonged drought in the Midwest turned thousands of farm
families into homeless migrants. Investment, both business and residential, fell to
extremely low levels, and a “trade war”—in which countries competed in erecting
barriers to imports—virtually halted international trade.
Although most people think of the Great Depression as a single episode, tech-
nically it consisted of two business cycles, as Table 8.1 shows. The contraction
phase of the ﬁrst cycle lasted forty-three months, from August 1929 until March
1933, and was the most precipitous economic decline in U.S. history. After Franklin
Roosevelt took ofﬁce as President in March 1933 and instituted a set of policies
known collectively as the New Deal, a strong expansion began and continued for
ﬁfty months, from March 1933 to May 1937. By 1937 real GDP was almost back to
its 1929 level, although at 14% the unemployment rate remained high. Unemploy-
ment remained high in 1937 despite the recovery of real GDP because the number
of people of working age had grown since 1929 and because increases in produc-
tivity allowed employment to grow more slowly than output.
The second cycle of the Great Depression began in May 1937 with a contraction
phase that lasted more than a year. Despite a new recovery that began in June
1938, the unemployment rate was still more than 17% in 1939.
The Great Depression ended dramatically with the advent of World War II.
Even before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the
war in December 1941, the economy was gearing up for increased armaments pro-
duction. After the shock of Pearl Harbor, the United States prepared for total war.
With production supervised by government boards and driven by the insatiable
demands of the military for more guns, planes, and ships, real GDP almost doubled
between 1939 and 1944. Unemployment dropped sharply, averaging less than 2%
of the labor force in 1943–1945 and bottoming out at 1.2% in 1944.
Post–World War II U.S. Business Cycles
As World War II was ending in 1945, economists and policymakers were concerned
that the economy would relapse into depression. As an expression of this concern,
Congress passed the Employment Act of 1946, which required the government to
ﬁght recessions and depressions with any measures at its disposal. But instead of
falling into a new depression as feared, the U.S. economy began to grow strongly.
Only a few relatively brief and mild recessions interrupted the economic expansion
of the early postwar period. None of the ﬁve contractions that occurred between 1945
and 1970 lasted more than a year, whereas eighteen of the twenty-two previous cyclical
contractions in the NBER’s monthly chronology had lasted a year or more. The largest
drop in real GDP between 1945 and 1970 was 3.3% during the 1957–1958 recession, and
throughout this period unemployment never exceeded 8.1% of the work force. Again,
there was a correlation between economic expansion and war: The 1949–1953 expansion
corresponded closely to the Korean War, and the latter part of the strong 1961–1969
expansion occurred during the military buildup to ﬁght the Vietnam War.

280 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
Because no serious recession occurred between 1945 and 1970, some econo-
mists suggested that the business cycle had been “tamed,” or even that it was
“dead.” This view was especially popular during the 106-month expansion of
1961–1969, which was widely attributed not only to high rates of military spending
during the Vietnam War but also to the macroeconomic policies of Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson. Some argued that policymakers should stop worrying
about recessions and focus their attention on inﬂation, which had been gradually
increasing over the 1960s.
Unfortunately, reports of the business cycle’s death proved premature. Shortly
after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeded in qua-
drupling oil prices in the fall of 1973, the U.S. economy and the economies of many
other nations fell into a severe recession. In the 1973–1975 recession U.S. real GDP
fell by 3.4% and the unemployment rate reached 9%—not a depression but a serious
downturn, nonetheless. Also disturbing was the fact that inﬂation, which had fallen
during most previous recessions, shot up to unprecedented double-digit levels.
Inﬂation continued to be a problem for the rest of the 1970s, even as the economy
recovered from the 1973–1975 recession.
More evidence that the business cycle wasn’t dead came with the sharp
1981–1982 recession. This contraction lasted sixteen months, the same length as
the 1973–1975 decline, and the unemployment rate reached 11%, a postwar high.
Many economists claim that the Fed knowingly created this recession to reduce
inflation, a claim we discuss in Chapter 11. Inflation did drop dramatically, from
about 11% to less than 4% per year. The recovery from this recession was strong,
however.
The “Long Boom”
The expansion that followed the 1981–1982 recession lasted almost eight years,
until July 1990, when the economy again entered a recession. This contraction was
relatively short (the trough came in March 1991, only eight months after the peak)
and shallow (the unemployment rate peaked in mid 1992 at 7.7%—not particularly
high for a recession). Moreover, after some initial sluggishness, the 1990–1991 reces-
sion was followed by another sustained expansion that lasted 120 months,
making it the longest in U.S. history. Taking the expansions of the 1980s and 1990s
together, you can see that the U.S. economy experienced a period of more than
eighteen years during which only one relatively minor recession occurred. Some
observers referred to this lengthy period of prosperity as the “long boom.” The long
boom ended with the business cycle peak in March 2001, after which the U.S. econ-
omy suffered a mild recession and sluggish growth. After six years of modest
growth, the economy suffered a recession that began in December 2007 and wors-
ened severely in the ﬁnancial crisis of the fall of 2008. As the recession was still
ongoing as of this writing, it had become the longest recession since the ﬁrst phase
of the Great Depression.
Have American Business Cycles Become Less Severe?
Until recently, macroeconomists believed that, over the long sweep of history, busi-
ness cycles generally have become less severe. Obviously , no recession in the United
States since World War II can begin to rival the severity of the Great Depression.
M08_ABEL4529_07_SE_C08.QXD  12/9/09  3:50 PM  Page 280
Chapter 8 Business Cycles 281
Even putting aside the Great Depression, economists generally believed that
business downturns before 1929 were longer and deeper than those since 1945.
According to the NBER business cycle chronology (Table 8.1), for example, the aver-
age contraction before 1929 lasted nearly twenty-one months and the average
expansion lasted slightly more than twenty-ﬁve months. Since 1945, contractions
have shortened to an average of eleven months, and expansions have lengthened to
an average of more than ﬁfty months, even excluding the lengthy expansion of the
1990s. Standard measures of economic ﬂuctuations, such as real GDP growth and
the unemployment rate, also show considerably less volatility since 1945, relative to
data available for the pre–1929 era.
Since World War II a major goal of economic policy has been to reduce the size
and frequency of recessions. If researchers found—contrary to the generally accepted
view—that business cycles had not moderated in the postwar period, serious doubt
would be cast on the ability of economic policymakers to achieve this goal. For this
reason, although the question of whether the business cycle has moderated over time
may seem to be a matter of interest only to economic historians, this issue is of great
practical importance.
Thus Christina Romer, the Chair of President Obama’s Council of Econom-
ic Advisers, sparked a heated controversy by writing a series of articles in the
1980s denying the claim that the business cycle has moderated over time.
4
Romer’s main point concerned the dubious quality of the pre–1929 data. Unlike
today, in earlier periods the government didn’t collect comprehensive data on
economic variables such as GDP. Instead, economic historians, using whatever
fragmentary information they could find, have had to estimate historical mea-
sures of these variables.
Romer argued that methods used for estimating historical data typically over-
stated the size of earlier cyclical ﬂuctuations. For example, widely accepted esti-
mates of pre–1929 GNP
5
were based on estimates of just the goods-producing
sectors of the economy, which are volatile, while ignoring less-volatile sectors such
as wholesale and retail distribution, transportation, and services. As a result, the
volatility of GNP was overstated. Measured properly, GNP varied substantially less
over time than the ofﬁcial statistics showed. Romer’s arguments sparked addi-
tional research, though none proved decisively whether volatility truly declined
after 1929. Nonetheless, the debate served the useful purpose of forcing a careful
reexamination of the historical data.
New research shows that economic volatility declined in the mid 1980s and has
remained low since then. Because the quality of the data is not an issue for the period
following World War II, the decline in volatility in the mid 1980s, relative to the pre-
ceding forty years, probably reﬂects a genuine change in economic volatility rather
than a change in how economic data are produced.

Cyclical Behavior of Individual Production Series, 1889–1984,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, February
1991, pp. 1–31.

As discussed in Chapter 2, until 1991 the U.S. national income and product accounts focused on
GNP rather than GDP . As a result, studies of business cycle behavior have often focused on GNP
rather than GDP .

shows that the volatility, as measured by the standard deviation
of a variable, declined by 20 to 40% for many of the twenty-one variables
they examine, including a decline of 33% for real GDP, 27% for employment,
and 50% for inflation. Because the decline in volatility of macroeconomic
variables has been so widespread, economists have dubbed this episode “the
Great Moderation.”
7
To see what we mean by the Great Moderation, let’s begin by looking at real
GDP growth since 1960. In Fig. 8.2, we have plotted the quarterly growth rate of
real GDP (seasonally adjusted at an annual rate). You can see that from 1960 until
about 1984, the growth rate changes signiﬁcantly from quarter to quarter, but after
1984 it seems considerably more stable.
Another graphical device that will help us to see the Great Moderation is a
plot of the standard deviation of quarterly real GDP growth. The standard devi-
ation of a variable is a measure of its volatility. Because we think the volatility
has changed over time, we are going to calculate the standard deviation over

Since the Stock and Watson paper was written, much additional research has been undertaken, with
mixed results. For example, Shaghil Ahmed, Andrew Levin, and Beth Ann Wilson [“Recent Improve-
ments in U.S. Macroeconomic Stability: Good Policy, Good Practices, or Good Luck?” Review of Eco-
nomics and Statistics, vol. 86 (2004), pp. 824–832] suggest that good luck played the biggest role, while
others ﬁnd a larger role for monetary policy, including Peter M. Summers [“What Caused the Great
Moderation? Some Cross-Country Evidence,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Economic Review
(Third Quarter 2005), pp. 5–32].
seven-year periods. The result is shown in Fig. 8.3. Note that each point shown
on the graph represents the standard deviation of GDP growth for the preceding
seven years. The graph shows a sharp decline in about 1984 in the seven-year
standard deviation. The uptick in that standard deviation in 2009 might lead
some to worry that the Great Moderation could be over; but we will need many
more years of data to know for sure.
Somewhat surprisingly, the reduction in volatility seemed to come from a
sudden, one-time drop rather than a gradual decline. The break seems to have
come around 1984 for many economic variables, though for some variables the
break occurred much later.
What accounts for this reduction in the volatility of the economy? Stock and
Watson found that better monetary policy is responsible for about 20% to 30% of
the reduction in output volatility, with reduced shocks to the economy’s pro-
ductivity accounting for about 15% and reduced shocks to food and commodi-
ty prices accounting for another 15%. The remainder is attributable to some
unknown form of good luck in terms of smaller shocks to the economy.

8.3 Business Cycle Facts
Although no two business cycles are identical, all (or most) cycles have features in
common. This point has been made strongly by a leading business cycle theorist,
Nobel laureate Robert E. Lucas, Jr., of the University of Chicago:
Though there is absolutely no theoretical reason to anticipate it, one is led by the facts
to conclude that, with respect to the qualitative behavior of comovements among se-
ries [that is, economic variables], business cycles are all alike. To theoretically inclined
economists, this conclusion should be attractive and challenging, for it suggests the
possibility of a uniﬁed explanation of business cycles, grounded in the general laws
governing market economies, rather than in political or institutional characteristics
speciﬁc to particular countries or periods.
9
Lucas’s statement that business cycles are all alike (or more accurately, that
they have many features in common) is based on examinations of comovements
among economic variables over the business cycle. In this section, we study these
comovements, which we call business cycle facts, for the post–World War II period
in the United States. Knowing these business cycle facts is useful for interpreting
economic data and evaluating the state of the economy. In addition, they provide
guidance and discipline for developing economic theories of the business cycle.
When we discuss alternative theories of the business cycle in Chapters 10 and 11,
we evaluate the theories principally by determining how well they account for
business cycle facts. To be successful, a theory of the business cycle must explain
the cyclical behavior of not just a few variables, such as output and employment,
but of a wide range of key economic variables.
The Cyclical Behavior of Economic Variables: Direction and Timing
Two characteristics of the cyclical behavior of macroeconomic variables are impor-
tant to our discussion of the business cycle facts. The ﬁrst is the direction in which
a macroeconomic variable moves, relative to the direction of aggregate economic
activity. An economic variable that moves in the same direction as aggregate eco-
nomic activity (up in expansions, down in contractions) is procyclical. A variable
that moves in the opposite direction to aggregate economic activity (up in con-
tractions, down in expansions) is countercyclical. Variables that do not display a
clear pattern over the business cycle are acyclical.
The second characteristic is the timing of the variable’s turning points (peaks
and troughs) relative to the turning points of the business cycle. An economic vari-
able is a leading variable if it tends to move in advance of aggregate economic
activity. In other words, the peaks and troughs in a leading variable occur before
the corresponding peaks and troughs in the business cycle. A coincident variable
is one whose peaks and troughs occur at about the same time as the corresponding
business cycle peaks and troughs. Finally, a lagging variable is one whose peaks
and troughs tend to occur later than the corresponding peaks and troughs in the
business cycle.

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Coincident and Leading Indexes
In this chapter we discuss a large number of variables and describe how they behave
as the economy goes through expansions and contractions. One difﬁculty faced by
policymakers and economic analysts is how to sort through all of the different eco-
nomic data and ﬁgure out where the economy stands overall; a more challenging
problem is to forecast, in advance, when the economy will change course. To address
these problems, economists have developed coincident and leading indexes. An
index is a single number that combines data on a variety of economic variables. A
coincident index is an index that is designed to have peaks and troughs that occur
about the same time as the corresponding peaks and troughs in aggregate econom-
ic activity , and is useful for assessing whether the economy is currently in a recession
or an expansion. A leading index is designed to have its peaks and troughs before the
corresponding peaks and troughs in aggregate economic activity , and thus might be
useful for forecasting turning points in the business cycle.
The ﬁrst indexes were developed in the 1930s at the National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research (NBER) by Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns,* whose important
early work on business cycles was mentioned earlier in this chapter. Today, these
original indexes (with some modiﬁcation and updating) are produced by The Con-
ference Board, and other indexes have been developed by other economists. In this
box, we discuss two recently developed coincident indexes and The Conference
Board’s index of leading economic indicators.
The fact that some economic variables consistently lead the business cycle sug-
gests that they might be used to forecast the future course of the economy. Some
analysts have used downturns in the stock market to predict recessions, but such
an indicator is not infallible. As Paul Samuelson noted: “Wall Street indexes pre-
dicted nine out of the last ﬁve recessions.”
10
In some cases, the cyclical timing of a variable is obvious from a graph of its
behavior over the course of several business cycles; in other cases, elaborate statis-
tical techniques are needed to determine timing. Conveniently, The Conference
Board has analyzed the timing of dozens of economic variables. This information
is published monthly in Business Cycle Indicators, along with the most recent data
for these variables. For the most part, in this chapter we rely on The Conference
Board’s timing classiﬁcations.
Let’s now examine the cyclical behavior of some key macroeconomic vari-
ables. We showed the historical behavior of several of these variables in
Figs. 1.1–1.4. Those ﬁgures covered a long time period and were based on annual
data. We can get a better view of short-run cyclical behavior by looking at quarter-
ly or monthly data. The direction and timing of the variables considered are
presented in Summary table 10 on page 290.

286 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
The Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) was developed in 2001 by
economist Jonas Fisher of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. This coincident
index is based on 85 monthly economic variables in ﬁve categories: production
and income, the labor market, consumption and housing, manufacturing and
sales, and inventories and orders. The index is constructed so that it has an aver-
age value of 0 over time. Figure 8.4 shows the values of the CFNAI, averaged over
the current and preceding two months, since March 1967. The graph includes
recession bars, showing the dates of recessions as determined by the NBER. As the
graph shows, the CFNAI turns signiﬁcantly negative in recessions, falling much
more in severe recessions (such as 1973–1975, 1981–1982, and the recession that
began in December 2007) than in mild recession (such as 1990–1991 and 2001).**
Another recently developed coincident index is the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti (ADS)
Business Conditions Index, which doesn’t use as many variables as the CFNAI, but
uses variables that have different frequencies: some quarterly data (real GDP), some
monthly data (payroll employment, industrial production, personal income less
transfer payments, and manufacturing and trade sales), and some weekly data (ini-
tial jobless claims). Like the CFNAI, the ADS index is constructed so that it has an

average value of 0 over time. The developers of the model, Boragan Aruoba of the
University of Maryland, Francis X. Diebold of the University of Pennsylvania, and
Chiara Scotti of the Federal Reserve Board, sought an index that could be estimated
to provide a measure of the state of the economy on a day-by-day basis. They imple-
mented the index in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,
which updates the series once or twice each week. Figure 8.5 shows the values of the
ADS index, averaged over the current and preceding two months.***
Comparing the two indexes, we can see that they are quite similar, despite
using very different sets of data. Of course, it is not surprising that the two indexes
are similar because they are both designed to measure the underlying state of aggre-
gate economic activity. An advantage of the ADS index is that it is available very
frequently (it gets updated once each week or more often). But the CFNAI has a
longer history of reliability in real time, since it was developed in 2001, whereas the
ADS index just began to be produced in real time in 2009.
Unlike the CFNAI and the ADS index, which were designed to measure the cur-
rent state of the economy, the composite index of leading economic indicators was

288 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
designed to help anticipate or forecast turning points in aggregate economic activity.
However, its record as a forecasting tool is mixed. When the index declines for two or
three consecutive months, it warns that a recession is likely. However, its forecasting
acumen in real time has not been very good because of the following problems:
1. Data on the components of the index are often revised when more complete
data become available. Revisions change the value of the index and may even
reverse a signal of a future recession.
2. The index is prone to giving false signals, predicting recessions that did not
materialize.
3. The index does not provide any information on when a recession might arrive
or how severe it might be.
4. Changes in the structure of the economy over time may cause some variables
to become better predictors of the economy and others to become worse. For
this reason, the index must be revised periodically, as the list of component
indicators is changed.
Research by Francis X. Diebold and Glenn Rudebusch of the Federal Reserve Bank
of San Francisco showed that the revisions were substantial.
†
The agency calculating
the index (the Commerce Department or The Conference Board) often demonstrates
the value of the index with a plot of the index over time, showing how it turns down
just before every recession. But Diebold and Rudebusch showed that such a plot is illu-
sory because the index plotted was not the one used at the time of each recession, but
rather a revised index made many years after the fact. In real time, they concluded, the
use of the index does not improve forecasts of industrial production.
For example, suppose you were examining the changes over time in the
composite index of leading indicators, and used the rule of thumb that a decline in
the index for three months in a row meant that a recession was likely in the next
six months to one year. You would have noticed in December 1969 that the index
had declined two months in a row; by January 1970 you would have seen the
third monthly decline. In fact, the NBER declared that a recession had begun in
December 1969, so the index did not give you any advance warning. Even worse,
if you had been following the index in 1973 to 1974, you would have thought all
was well until September 1974, when the index declined for the second month in a
row, or October 1974, when the third monthly decline occurred. But the NBER
declared that a recession had actually begun in November 1973, so the index was
nearly a year late in calling the recession.
After missing a recession’s onset so badly, the creators of the index naturally
want to improve it. So, they may revise the index with different variables, give the
variables different weights, or manipulate the statistics so that, if the new revised
index had been available, it would have indicated that a recession were coming. For
example, the revised index published in April 1979 would have given eight months
of lead time before the recession that began in December 1969 and six months of lead
time before the recession that began in November 1973. But of course, that index
was not available to forecasters when it would have been useful—before the
recessions began.

experimental leading indexes did not suggest an appreciable probability of recession
in either 1990 or 2001. In early 1990, the experimental recession index of Stock and
Watson showed that the probability that a recession would occur in the next six
months never exceeded 10%. Also, in late 2000 and early 2001, the index did not rise
above 10%. So, although the Stock and Watson approach appeared promising in
prospect, it did not deliver any improvement in forecasting recessions.
The inability of leading indicators to forecast recessions may simply mean that
recessions are often unusual events, caused by large, unpredictable shocks such as dis-
ruptions in the world oil supply or a near-collapse of the ﬁnancial system. If so, then
the pursuit of the perfect index of leading indicators may prove to be frustrating.

Production
Because the level of production is a basic indicator of aggregate economic activity,
peaks and troughs in production tend to occur at about the same time as peaks and
troughs in aggregate economic activity. Thus production is a coincident and pro-
cyclical variable. Figure 8.6 shows the behavior of the industrial production index

in the United States since 1947. This index is a broad measure of production in man-
ufacturing, mining, and utilities. The vertical lines P and T in Figs. 8.4–8.14 indicate
the dates of business cycle peaks and troughs, as determined by the NBER (see
Table 8.1). The turning points in industrial production correspond closely to
the turning points of the cycle.
Although almost all types of production rise in expansions and fall in reces-
sions, the cyclical sensitivity of production in some sectors of the economy is
greater than in others. Industries that produce relatively durable, or long-lasting,
goods—houses, consumer durables (refrigerators, cars, washing machines), or cap-
ital goods (drill presses, computers, factories)—respond strongly to the business
cycle, producing at high rates during expansions and at much lower rates during
recessions. In contrast, industries that produce relatively nondurable or short-lived
goods (foods, paper products) or services (education, insurance) are less sensitive
to the business cycle.

is more sensitive than
consumption to the busi-

fact that durable goods

expenditures on con-

tion of nondurable goods

Expenditure
For components of expenditure, as for types of production, durability is the key to
determining sensitivity to the business cycle. Figure 8.7 shows the cyclical behav-
ior of consumption of nondurable goods, consumption of services, consumption
expenditures on durable goods, and investment. Investment is made up primarily
of spending on durable goods and is strongly procyclical. In contrast, consumption
of nondurable goods and consumption of services are both much smoother. Con-
sumption expenditures on durable goods are more strongly procyclical than con-
sumption expenditures on nondurable goods or consumption of services, but not
as procyclical as investment expenditures. With respect to timing, consumption and
investment are generally coincident with the business cycle, although individual
components of ﬁxed investment vary in their cyclical timing.
11
One component of spending that seems to follow its own rules is inventory
investment, or changes in business inventories (not shown), which often displays
large ﬂuctuations that aren’t associated with business cycle peaks and troughs. In
general, however, inventory investment is procyclical and leading. Even though
goods kept in inventory need not be durable, inventory investment is also very
volatile. Although, on average, inventory investment is a small part (about 1%) of
total spending, sharp declines in inventory investment represented a large part of
the total decline in spending in some recessions, most notably those of 1973–1975,
1981–1982, and 2001.

Government purchases of goods and services generally are procyclical. Rapid
military buildups, as during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War,
are usually associated with economic expansions.
Employment and Unemployment
Business cycles are strongly felt in the labor market. In a recession, employment grows
slowly or falls, many workers are laid off, and jobs become more difﬁcult to ﬁnd.
Figure 8.8 shows the number of civilians employed in the United States since
1955. Employment clearly is procyclical, as more people have jobs in booms than in
recessions, and also is coincident with the cycle.
Figure 8.9 shows the civilian unemployment rate, which is the fraction of the
civilian labor force (the number of people who are available for work and want to
work) that is unemployed. The civilian unemployment rate is strongly counter-
cyclical, rising sharply in contractions but falling more slowly in expansions.
Although The Conference Board has studied the timing of unemployment, Sum-
mary table 10 shows that the timing of this variable is designated as “unclassiﬁed,”
owing to the absence of a clear pattern in the data. Figures 8.8 and 8.9 illustrate a
worrisome change in the patterns of recent recessions: namely in both the
1990–1991 and 2001 recessions, employment growth stagnated and unemployment
tended to rise for some time even after the recession’s trough was reached. This pat-
tern led observers to refer to the recovery period following these recessions as
“jobless recoveries.” Fortunately, both of these recoveries eventually gained
strength and the economy showed employment growth and a decline in the rate of
unemployment.

APPLICATION
The Job Finding Rate and the Job Loss Rate
In considering the cyclical movement of employment, we examined the total
amount of employment in the economy. As we discussed in Chapter 3, in any
given month, we can examine the probability that someone ﬁnds a job in that
month or loses a job in that month. It turn out that those probabilities change over
time, depending on whether the economy is in a recession or an expansion. For
example, the probability that someone who is unemployed will ﬁnd a job in the
next month, which we call the job ﬁnding rate, declines during recessions and
increases in expansions. As you might imagine, the probability that someone who
is employed will lose his or her job in the next month, which we call the job loss
rate, increases during recessions and decreases in expansions.
12
Figure 8.10 shows the job ﬁnding rate over the course of the business cycle.
Notice that the job ﬁnding rate generally rises during each economic expansion,
and falls in recessions. The decline in recessions is a bit faster than the rise of the job
ﬁnding rate in expansions. The job ﬁnding rate changes substantially over the
business cycle. In the expansion of the 1980s, the job ﬁnding rate rose from a low of

18% in November 1982 to a peak of 33% in late 1989, an increase of 15 percentage
points. In the expansion of the 1990s, the job ﬁnding rate rose from 21% in late 1991
to 35% in April 2000, an increase of 14 percentage points. And in some recessions,
such as the one in 2001, the decline in the job ﬁnding rate can be very sharp, and it
sometimes continues to decline even after the recession ends, as occurred following
the 1990–1991 recession and the 2001 recession. A particularly disturbing feature of
the recession that began in December 2007 is the decline of the job ﬁnding rate to its
lowest point since the data became available in 1976.
Figure 8.11 shows the job loss rate, which is the probability that a person
employed in one month becomes unemployed the next month.
13
The ﬁrst thing to
notice is that the job loss rate is very low compared with the job ﬁnding rate (the
scales on Figs. 8.10 and 8.11 are different, so be sure to look at the percentages shown
on the vertical axes of both graphs). The job loss rate averaged 1.5% from 1976 to
2009. It appeared to be on a long steady decline over time in the 1980s and 1990s but
did not decline much in the 2000s, and increased sharply in the recession that began
in 2007. Even with the more recent upturn in the job loss rate, the probability remains
less than 2% that an employed person will lose his or her job in any given month.
Over the course of the business cycle, the job loss rate generally declines in eco-
nomic expansions and rises in recessions. Compared with the job ﬁnding rate, the
changes in the job loss rate are very small. So, at ﬁrst glance, you might think that
13
People who lose jobs in a given month may become unemployed or may move out of the labor force
in the following month. We use the term job loss to indicate only the transition from being employed
in one month to being unemployed in the following month.

because the job ﬁnding rate falls substantially in recessions, while the job loss rate
does not change very much, changes in the job ﬁnding rate are primarily respon-
sible for changes in the overall unemployment rate for the economy.
To investigate this issue, we will use the data in Table 8.2 to examine job losses
and jobs found in an economic expansion and in a recession. First consider changes
in employment status during June 2007, which was near the end of the expansion
that ended in December 2007. As shown in the ﬁrst column of Table 8.2, in June
2007, the job loss rate was 1.2% and the number of employed workers was 147.0
million, so the number of people who were employed at the start of the month and
who became unemployed during the month was 0.012 : 147.0 million = 1.8 million.
Similarly, we can calculate the number of people who were unemployed at the start

of the month and who became employed during the month. The job ﬁnding rate
was 25.5% and the number of unemployed workers was 7.3 million, so the number
of people who were unemployed at the start of the month and who became
employed during the month was 0.255 : 7.3 million = 1.9 million. With 1.8 million
workers losing jobs and 1.9 million workers ﬁnding jobs, the number of unem-
ployed people fell by 0.1 million during June 2007.
14
In a recession, the decline in the job ﬁnding rate combined with the rise in the
job loss rate together cause the number of employed workers to decline and the
number of unemployed workers to rise. For example, consider changes in employ-
ment during October 2008, in the middle of the ﬁnancial crisis. As shown in the
second column of Table 8.2, the job loss rate was 1.6% and the number of employed
workers was 145.5 million, so the number of people who were employed at the
start of the month and who became unemployed during the month was 0.016 :
145.5 million = 2.3 million. Similarly, we can calculate the number of people who
were unemployed at the start of the month and who became employed during the
month. The job ﬁnding rate was 20.7% and the number of unemployed workers
was 9.5 million, so the number of people who were unemployed at the start of the
month and who became employed during the month is 0.207 : 9.5 million = 2.0
million. With 2.3 million workers losing jobs and only 2.0 million workers ﬁnding
jobs, the number of unemployed people increased by 0.3 million.
Notice in these calculations that the number of people who are employed is
much larger than the number of people who are unemployed. Thus, even though
the job ﬁnding rate falls by more than the job loss rate rises in recessions, the job
loss rate is multiplied by a much larger number than is the job ﬁnding rate. For
example, during October 2008, the ratio of employed to unemployed was 15 to 1.
So, smaller changes in the job loss rate may lead to larger changes in the number of
unemployed workers than larger changes in the job ﬁnding rate. Indeed, compar-
ing October 2008 to June 2007, the number of newly unemployed people (those
who suffered job losses in that month) increased by 0.5 million despite the small
increase in the job loss rate, while the number of newly employed people (those
who found jobs in that month) increased by only 0.1 million.
15
In summary, economists have found interesting patterns to the changes in job
losses and hiring over the course of the business cycle. The most surprising ﬁnding
is that the job ﬁnding rate declines substantially more than the job loss rate rises
during recessions. But since the job loss rate applies to many more people, job loss
is the main force in increased unemployment rates during recessions, though the
lower job ﬁnding rate also plays a role.
14
For simplicity, we have ignored people who have moved into or out of the labor force in our calculations.
15
Note that even though the job ﬁnding rate was lower in October 2008 than in June 2007, more
unemployed people found jobs in October 2008 than in June 2007 because there were so many more
unemployed people in October 2008 than in June 2007.
Average Labor Productivity and the Real Wage
Two other signiﬁcant labor market variables are average labor productivity and the
real wage. As discussed in Chapter 1, average labor productivity is output per unit of
labor input. Figure 8.12 shows average labor productivity measured as total real

output in the U.S. economy (excluding farms) divided by the total number of hours
worked to produce that output. Average labor productivity tends to be procyclical: In
booms workers produce more output during each hour of work than they do in reces-
sions.
16
Although The Conference Board doesn’t designate the timing of this variable,
studies show that average labor productivity tends to lead the business cycle.
17
Recall from Chapter 3 that the real wage is the compensation received by work-
ers per unit of time (such as an hour or a week) measured in real, or purchasing-
power, terms. The real wage, as shown in Fig. 8.12, is an especially important
variable in the study of business cycles because it is one of the main determinants
of the amount of labor supplied by workers and demanded by ﬁrms. Most of the
evidence points to the conclusion that real wages are mildly procyclical, but there
is some controversy on this point.
18
Money Growth and Inflation
Another variable whose cyclical behavior is somewhat controversial is the money
supply. Figure 8.13 shows the behavior since 1959 of the growth in the M2 measure
16
The Application in Chapter 3, “The Production Function of the U.S. Economy and U.S. Productivity
Growth,” p. 60, made the point that total factor productivity A also tends to be procyclical.
17
See Robert J. Gordon, “The ‘End of Expansion’ Phenomenon in Short-Run Productivity Behavior,”
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1979:2, pp. 447–461.
18
Strong procyclicality for the real wage is claimed by Gary Solon, Robert Barsky, and Jonathan Parker,
“Measuring the Cyclicality of Real Wages: How Important Is Composition Bias?” Quarterly Journal of
Economics, February 1994, pp. 1–25. But their results are disputed by others, such as Paul J. Devereux,

Review, July 2001, pp. 835–850.

However, the ﬁgure

just before a cyclical

torical studies suggest
that, generally, money
growth is procyclical and
leading. Inﬂation, here

of the money supply.
19
Note that (nominal) money growth ﬂuctuates a great deal
and doesn’t always display an obvious cyclical pattern. However, as Fig. 8.13
shows, money growth often falls sharply at or just before the onset of a recession.
Moreover, many statistical and historical studies—including a classic work by
Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz
20
that used data back to 1867—demonstrate
that money growth is procyclical and leads the cycle.
The cyclical behavior of inﬂation, also shown in Fig. 8.13, presents a somewhat
clearer picture. Inﬂation is procyclical but with some lag. Inﬂation typically builds
during an economic expansion, peaks slightly after the business cycle peak, and
then falls until some time after the business cycle trough is reached. Atypically,
inﬂation did not increase during the long boom of the 1990s.
Financial Variables
Financial variables are another class of economic variables that are sensitive to the
cycle. For example, stock prices are generally procyclical (stock prices rise in good
economic times) and leading (stock prices usually fall in advance of a recession).
Nominal interest rates are procyclical and lagging. The nominal interest rate
shown in Fig. 8.14 is the rate on three-month Treasury bills. However, other inter-
est rates, such as the prime rate (charged by banks to their best customers) and the

See Table 7.1 for a deﬁnition of M2. To reduce the effect of high month-to-month volatility in money
growth, Fig. 8.13 presents a six-month moving average of money growth rates; that is, the reported
growth rate in each month is actually the average of the growth rate in the current month and in the
previous ﬁve months.

Federal funds rate (the interest rate on overnight loans made from one bank to
another) also are procyclical and lagging. Note that nominal interest rates have the
same general cyclical pattern as inﬂation; in Chapter 7 we discussed why nominal
interest rates tend to move up and down with the inﬂation rate.
The real interest rate doesn’t have an obvious cyclical pattern. For instance, the
real interest rate actually was negative during the 1973–1975 recession but was very
high during the 1981–1982 recession. (Annual values of the real interest rate are
shown in Fig. 2.3.) The acyclicality of the real interest rate doesn’t necessarily mean
its movements are unimportant over the business cycle. Instead, the lack of a stable
cyclical pattern may reﬂect the facts that individual business cycles have different
causes and that these different sources of cycles have different effects on the real
interest rate.
International Aspects of the Business Cycle
So far we have concentrated on business cycles in the United States. However,
business cycles are by no means unique to the United States, having been regular-
ly observed in all industrialized market economies. In most cases the cyclical
behavior of key economic variables in these other economies is similar to that
described for the United States.
The business cycle is an international phenomenon in another sense: Fre-
quently, the major industrial economies undergo recessions and expansions at
about the same time, suggesting that they share a common cycle. Figure 8.15 illus-
trates this common cycle by showing the index of industrial production since 1960
for each of six major industrial countries. Note in particular the effects of world-
wide recessions in about 1975, 1982, 1991, 2001, and 2008. Figure 8.15 also shows
that each economy experiences many small ﬂuctuations not shared by the others.

8.4 Business Cycle Analysis: A Preview
The business cycle facts presented in this chapter would be useful even if we took
them no further. For example, being familiar with the typical cyclical patterns of
key macroeconomic variables may help forecasters project the course of the econ-
omy, as we showed when discussing leading indicators. Knowing the facts about
cycles also is important for businesspeople making investment and hiring decisions
and for ﬁnancial investors trying to choose portfolios that provide the desired
combinations of risk and return. However, macroeconomists are interested not
only in what happens during business cycles but also in why it happens. This desire
to understand cycles isn’t just idle intellectual curiosity. For example, as we demon-
strate in Chapters 9–11, the advice that macroeconomists give to policymakers
about how to respond to a recession depends on what they think is causing the
recession. Thus, with the business cycle facts as background, in the rest of Part 3 we
describe the primary alternative explanations of business cycle ﬂuctuations, as
well as policy recommendations based on these explanations.
In general, theories of the business cycle have two main components. The ﬁrst is
a description of the types of factors that have major effects on the economy—wars,
new inventions, harvest failures, and changes in government policy are examples.
Economists often refer to these (typically unpredictable) forces hitting the economy as
shocks. The other component of a business cycle theory is a model of how the economy
responds to the various shocks. Think of the economy as a car moving down a poorly
maintained highway: The shocks can be thought of as the potholes and bumps in the
road; the model describes how the components of the car (its tires and shock
absorbers) act to smooth out or amplify the effects of the shocks on the passengers.

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The Seasonal Cycle and the Business Cycle
Did you know that the United States has a large economic boom, followed by a
deep recession, every year? The boom always occurs in the fourth quarter of the
year (October through December). During this quarter output is 5% higher than in
the third quarter (July–September) and about 8% higher than in the following ﬁrst
quarter (January–March). Fortunately, the ﬁrst-quarter recession is always a short
one, with output rising by almost 4% in the second quarter (April–June). This reg-
ular seasonal pattern, known as the seasonal cycle, actually accounts for more than
85% of the total ﬂuctuation in the growth rate of real output!
Why don’t large seasonal fluctuations appear in Figs. 8.4–8.14? Normally,
macroeconomic data are seasonally adjusted, meaning that regularly recurring
seasonal ﬂuctuations are removed from the data. Seasonal adjustment allows users
of economic data to ignore seasonal changes and focus on business cycle ﬂuctua-
tions and longer-term movements in the data. However, Robert Barsky of the Uni-
versity of Michigan and Jeffrey Miron of Boston University* argue that the practice
of seasonally adjusting macroeconomic data may throw away information that
could help economists better understand the business cycle. Using data that hadn’t
been seasonally adjusted, Barsky and Miron determined that the comovements of
variables over the seasonal cycle are similar to their comovements over the business
cycle. Speciﬁcally, they obtained the following results:
1. Of the types of expenditure, expenditures on durable goods vary most over
the seasonal cycle and expenditures on services vary least.
2. Government spending is seasonally procyclical.
3. Employment is seasonally procyclical, and the unemployment rate is season-
ally countercyclical.
4. Average labor productivity is seasonally procyclical, and the real wage hardly
varies over the seasonal cycle.
5. The nominal money stock is seasonally procyclical.
Each observation appears to be true for both the business cycle and the sea-
sonal cycle (although, as discussed, there is some controversy about the cyclical
behavior of the real wage). However, the seasonal ﬂuctuations of inventory invest-
ment, the price level, and the nominal interest rate are much smaller than their ﬂuc-
tuations over the business cycle.
The seasonal cycle illustrates three potential sources of aggregate economic
ﬂuctuations: (1) changes in consumer demand, as at Christmastime; (2) changes in
productivity, as when construction workers become less productive because of
winter weather in the ﬁrst quarter; and (3) changes in labor supply, as when people
take summer vacations in the third quarter. Each of these three sources of ﬂuctua-
tion may also contribute to the business cycle.
As we discuss in Chapter 10, classical economists believe that business cycles
generally represent the economy’s best response to changes in the economic envi-
ronment, a response that macroeconomic policy need not try to eliminate. Although
it doesn’t necessarily conﬁrm this view, the seasonal cycle shows that large eco-
nomic ﬂuctuations may be desirable responses to various factors (Christmas, the
weather) and do not need to be offset by government policy.

302 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
The two principal business cycle theories that we discuss in this book are the
classical and the Keynesian theories. Fortunately , to present and discuss these two the-
ories we don’t have to develop two completely different models. Instead, both can
be considered within a general framework called the aggregate demand–aggregate
supply, or AD–AS, model. To introduce some of the key differences between the clas-
sical and Keynesian approaches to business cycle analysis, in the rest of this chapter
we preview the AD–AS model and how it is used to analyze business cycles.
Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply: A Brief Introduction
We develop and apply the AD–AS model, and a key building block of the AD–AS
model, the IS–LM model, in Chapters 9–11. Here, we simply introduce and brieﬂy
explain the basic components of the AD–AS model. The AD–AS model has three
components, as illustrated in Fig. 8.16: (1) the aggregate demand curve, (2) the
short-run aggregate supply curve, and (3) the long-run aggregate supply curve.
Each curve represents a relationship between the aggregate price level, P, measured
on the vertical axis in Fig. 8.16, and output, Y, measured along the horizontal axis.
The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows for any price level, P, the total quanti-
ty of goods and services, Y, demanded by households, ﬁrms, and governments. The
AD curve slopes downward in Fig. 8.16, implying that, when the general price level
is higher, people demand fewer goods and services. We give the precise explana-
tion for this downward slope in Chapter 9. The intuitive explanation for the down-
ward slope of the AD curve—that when prices are higher people can afford to buy
fewer goods—is not correct. The problem with the intuitive explanation is that,
although an increase in the general price level does reﬂect an increase in the prices
of most goods, it also implies an increase in the incomes of the people who produce
and sell those goods. Thus to say that a higher price level reduces the quantities of
Figure 8.16

demand–aggregate
supply model
The aggregate demand
(AD) curve slopes down-
ward, reﬂecting the fact
that the aggregate quan-
tity of goods and services
demanded, , falls when
the price level, P, rises.
The short-run aggregate
supply (SRAS) curve is
horizontal, reﬂecting the
assumption that, in the
short run, prices are ﬁxed
and ﬁrms simply pro-
duce whatever quantity
is demanded. In the long
run, ﬁrms produce their
normal levels of output,
so the long-run aggre-
gate supply (LRAS)
curve is vertical at the
full-employment level of
output, . The econo-
my’s short-run equilibri-
um is at the point where
the AD and SRAS curves
intersect, and its long-
run equilibrium is where
the AD and LRAS curves
intersect. In this example,
the economy is in both
short-run and long-run
equilibrium at point E.

goods and services that people can afford to buy is not correct, because their
incomes, as well as prices, have gone up.
The AD curve relates the amount of output demanded to the price level, if we
hold other economic factors constant. However, for a specific price level, any
change in the economy that increases the aggregate quantity of goods and services
demanded will shift the AD curve to the right (and any change that decreases the
quantity of goods and services demanded will shift the AD curve to the left). For
example, a sharp rise in the stock market, by making consumers wealthier, would
likely increase households’ demand for goods and services, shifting the AD curve
to the right. Similarly, the development of more efﬁcient capital goods would
increase ﬁrms’ demand for new capital goods, again shifting the AD curve to the
right. Government policies also can affect the AD curve. For example, a decline in
government spending on military hardware reduces the aggregate quantity of
goods and services demanded and shifts the AD curve to the left.
An aggregate supply curve indicates the amount of output producers are will-
ing to supply at any particular price level. Two aggregate supply curves are shown
in Fig. 8.16—one that holds in the short run and one that holds in the long run. The
short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve, shown in Fig. 8.16, is a horizontal line. The
horizontal SRAS curve captures the ideas that in the short run the price level is
ﬁxed and that ﬁrms are willing to supply any amount of output at that price. If the
short run is a very short period of time, such as a day, this assumption is realistic.
For instance, an ice cream store posts the price of ice cream in the morning and sells
as much ice cream as is demanded at that price (up to its capacity to produce ice
cream). During a single day, the owner typically won’t raise the price of ice cream
if the quantity demanded is unusually high; nor does the owner lower the price of
ice cream if the quantity demanded is unusually low. The tendency of a producer
to set a price for some time and then supply whatever is demanded at that price is
represented by a horizontal SRAS curve.
However, suppose that the quantity of ice cream demanded remains high day
after day, to the point that the owner is straining to produce enough ice cream to
meet demand. In this case, the owner may raise her price to reduce the quantity of
ice cream demanded to a more manageable level. The owner will keep raising the
price of ice cream as long as the quantity demanded exceeds normal production
capacity . In the long run, the price of ice cream will be whatever it has to be to equate
the quantity demanded to the owner’s normal level of output. Similarly , in the long
run, all other ﬁrms in the economy will adjust their prices as necessary so as to be
able to produce their normal level of output. As discussed in Chapter 3, the normal
level of production for the economy as a whole is called the full-employment level
of output, denoted . In the long run, then, when prices fully adjust, the aggregate
quantity of output supplied will simply equal the full-employment level of output,
. Thus the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is vertical, as shown in Fig. 8.16,
at the point that output supplied, Y,equals .
Figure 8.16 represents an economy that is simultaneously in short-run and
long-run equilibrium. The short-run equilibrium is represented by the intersection
of the AD and SRAS curves, shown as point E. The long-run equilibrium is repre-
sented by the intersection of the AD and LRAS curves, also shown as point E.
However, when some change occurs in the economy, the short-run equilibrium can
differ from the long-run equilibrium.
Aggregate Demand Shocks. Recall that a theory of business cycles has to include
a description of the shocks hitting the economy. The AD–AS framework identiﬁes

shocks by their initial effects—on aggregate demand or aggregate supply. An
aggregate demand shock is a change in the economy that shifts the AD curve. For
example, a negative aggregate demand shock would occur if consumers became
more pessimistic about the future and thus reduced their current consumption
spending, shifting the AD curve to the left.
To analyze the effect of an aggregate demand shock, let’s suppose that the
economy initially is in both short-run and long-run equilibrium at point E in
Fig. 8.17. We assume that, because consumers become more pessimistic, the aggre-
gate demand curve shifts down and to the left from AD
1
to AD
2
. In this case, the
new short-run equilibrium (the intersection of AD
2
and SRAS) is at point F, where
output has fallen to Y
2
and the price level remains unchanged at P
1
. Thus the
decline in household consumption demand causes a recession, with output falling
below its normal level. However, the economy will not stay at point F forever,
because ﬁrms won’t be content to keep producing below their normal capacity.
Eventually ﬁrms will respond to lower demand by adjusting their prices—in this
case downward—until the economy reaches its new long-run equilibrium at point
H, the intersection of AD
2
and LRAS. At point H, output is at its original level, ,
but the price level has fallen to P
2
.
Our analysis shows that an adverse aggregate demand shock, which shifts the
AD curve down, will cause output to fall in the short run but not in the long run.
How long does it take for the economy to reach the long run? This question is cru-
cial to economic analysis and is one to which classical economists and Keynesian
economists have very different answers. Their answers help explain why classicals
and Keynesians have different views about the appropriate role of government
policy in ﬁghting recessions.
The classical answer is that prices adjust quite rapidly to imbalances in quan-
tities supplied and demanded so that the economy gets to its long-run equilibrium
quickly—in a few months or less. Thus a recession caused by a downward shift of
the AD curve is likely to end rather quickly, as the price level falls and the economy
reaches the original level of output . In the strictest versions of the classical model,
the economy is assumed to reach its long–run equilibrium essentially immediately,
implying that the short-run aggregate supply curve is irrelevant and that the econ-
omy always operates on the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve. Because the
adjustment takes place quickly, classical economists argue that little is gained by the
government actively trying to ﬁght recessions. Note that this conclusion is consis-
tent with the “invisible hand“ argument described in Chapter 1, according to which
the free market and unconstrained price adjustments are sufﬁcient to achieve good
economic results.
In contrast to the classical view, Keynesian economists argue that prices (and
wages, which are the price of labor) do not necessarily adjust quickly in response to
shocks. Hence the return of the economy to its long-run equilibrium may be slow,
taking perhaps years rather than months. In other words, although Keynesians
agree with classicals that the economy’s level of output will eventually return from
its recessionary level (represented by Y
2
in Fig. 8.17) to its full-employment level, ,
they believe that this process may be slow. Because they lack conﬁdence in the self-
correcting powers of the economy, Keynesians tend to see an important role for the
government in ﬁghting recessions. For example, Keynes himself originally argued
that government could ﬁght recessions by increasing spending. In terms of  Fig. 8. 17,
an increase in government spending could in principle shift the AD curve up and to
the right, from AD
2
back to AD
1
, restoring the economy to full employment.

ment causes the econo-
my to move to the new

point H, where output
returns to its full-

and the price level falls

cal view, the economy
moves almost immedi-
ately to point H, so the
adverse aggregate
demand shock essential-
ly has no effect on output
in both the short run and
the long run. Keynesians
argue that the adjust-
ment process takes
longer, so that the

demand shock may lead
to a sustained decline in
output.

Aggregate Supply Shocks. Because classical economists believe that aggregate
demand shocks don’t cause sustained ﬂuctuations in output, they generally view
aggregate supply shocks as the major force behind changes in output and
employment. An aggregate supply shock is a change in the economy that causes the
long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve to shift. The position of the LRAS curve
depends only on the full-employment level of output, , so aggregate supply
shocks can also be thought of as factors—such as changes in productivity or labor
supply, for example—that lead to changes in .
Figure 8.18 illustrates the effects of an adverse supply shock—that is, a shock that
reduces the full-employment level of output (an example would be a severe drought
that greatly reduces crop yields). Suppose that the economy is initially in long-run
equilibrium at point E in Fig. 8.18, where the initial long-run aggregate supply curve,
LRAS
1
, intersects the aggregate demand curve, AD. Now imagine that the adverse
supply shock hits, reducing full-employment output from 
1
to 
2
and causing the
long-run aggregate supply curve to shift to the left from LRAS
1
to LRAS
2
. The new long-
run equilibrium occurs at point F, where the level of output is lower than at point E.
According to the classical view, the economy moves quickly from point E to point F and
then remains at point F. The drop in output as the economy moves from point E to point
F is a recession. Note that the new price level, P
2
, is higher than the initial price level, P
1
,
so adverse supply shocks cause prices to rise during recessions. We return to this impli-
cation for the price level and discuss its relation to the business cycle facts in Chapter 10.
Although classical economists ﬁrst emphasized supply shocks, Keynesian econ-
omists also recognize the importance of supply shocks in accounting for business
cycle ﬂuctuations in output. Keynesians agree that an adverse supply shock will
reduce output and increase the price level in the long run. In Chapter 11, we discuss
the Keynesian view of the process by which the economy moves from the short run
to the long run in response to a supply shock.

306 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. A business cycle consists of a period of declining
aggregate economic activity (a contraction or reces-
sion) followed by a period of rising economic activity
(an expansion or a boom). The low point of the con-
traction is called the trough, and the high point of the
expansion is called the peak. Business cycles have
been observed in market economies since the begin-
ning of industrialization.
2. The tendency of many economic variables to move
together in regular and predictable ways over the
course of the cycle is called comovement. We refer
to the typical cyclical patterns of key macroeco-
nomic variables as the “business cycle facts.”
3. The ﬂuctuations in aggregate economic activity that
constitute business cycles are recurrent, having been
observed again and again in industrialized market
economies. However, they aren’t periodic, in that
they don’t occur at regular or predictable intervals.
Business cycle ﬂuctuations also are persistent, which
means that once a recession or expansion begins, it
usually lasts for a while.
4. Many economists believe that the U.S. economy
before 1929 had longer recessions and more cyclical
volatility than the post–World War II economy. How-
ever, data problems prevent precise measurements of
how much more cyclical the pre–1929 economy was.
The Great Depression that began in 1929 and didn’t
end until the onset of World War II was the most
severe cyclical decline in U.S. history. Moderation of
the business cycle after World War II led to premature
pronouncements that the cycle was “dead.” However,
the U.S. economy suffered severe recessions in
1973–1975 and 1981–1982. Between 1982 and the end
of the millennium the economy enjoyed a “long
boom,” with only one minor recession in 1990–1991.
5. The direction of a variable relative to the business
cycle can be procyclical, countercyclical, or acyclical.
A procyclical variable moves in the same direction as
aggregate economic activity, rising in booms and
falling in recessions. A countercyclical variable moves
in the opposite direction to aggregate economic activ-
ity, falling in booms and rising in recessions. An
acyclical variable has no clear cyclical pattern.
6. The timing of a variable relative to the business cycle
may be coincident, leading, or lagging. A coincident
variable’s peaks and troughs occur at about the same

time as peaks and troughs in aggregate economic
activity. Peaks and troughs in a leading variable come
before, and peaks and troughs in a lagging variable
come after, the corresponding peaks and troughs in
aggregate economic activity.
7. The cyclical direction and timing of major macro-
economic variables—the business cycle facts—are
described in Summary table 10, p. 290. In brief, pro-
duction, consumption, and investment are pro-
cyclical and coincident. Investment is much more
volatile over the business cycle than consumption
is. Employment is procyclical, but the unemploy-
ment rate is countercyclical. Average labor produc-
tivity and the real wage are procyclical, although
according to most studies the real wage is only
mildly so. Money and stock prices are procyclical
and lead the cycle. Inflation and nominal interest
rates are procyclical and lagging. The real interest
rate is acyclical.
8. A theory of business cycles consists of (1) a descrip-
tion of shocks that affect the economy and (2) a
model, such as the aggregate demand–aggregate
supply (AD–AS) model, that describes how the
economy responds to these shocks. In the AD–AS
model, shocks to the aggregate demand (AD) curve
cause output to change in the short run, but output
returns to its full-employment level, , in the long
run. Shocks to the aggregate supply curve can affect
output both in the long run and the short run.
9. Classical economists argue that the economy reaches
its long-run equilibrium quickly, because prices
adjust rapidly. This view implies that aggregate
demand shocks have only very short-lived effects on
real variables such as output; instead, classical econ-
omists emphasize aggregate supply shocks as the
source of business cycles. Classicals also see little role
for government policies to ﬁght recessions. Keyne-
sian economists, in contrast, believe that it takes a
long time for the economy to reach long-run equilib-
rium. They conclude, therefore, that aggregate
demand shocks can affect output for substantial peri-
ods of time. Furthermore, they believe that govern-
ment policies may be useful in speeding the
economy’s return to full employment.

WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. An economic variable is persistent if declines in the vari-
able tend to be followed by more declines, and increases
by more increases. This question asks you to study the
persistence of the civilian unemployment rate.
Using data since 1961, identify all quarters in which
the unemployment rate changed by at least 0.2 percent-
age points from the previous quarter (either up or down).
(Note: you may wish to use the data converter on the
Web site for this textbook at www.pearsonhighered.com/abel/
to help you calculate quarterly averages of the unem-
ployment rate, which is a monthly variable.) How many
of these changes by 0.2 percentage points or more were
followed in the subsequent quarter by (1) another change
in the same direction, (2) a change in the opposite
direction, or (3) no change? Based on your count, would
you say that the unemployment rate is a persistent
variable?
2. How does each of the following variables behave over
the business cycle? Develop graphs to show your
results and give economic explanations.
a. Real imports
b. Federal government receipts
c. Housing starts
d. Capacity utilization rate, manufacturing
e. Average weekly hours, manufacturing

For further discussion of these issues, see Christina D. Romer, “Remeasuring Business Cycles,”
Journal of Economic History, September 1994, pp. 573–609; and Randall E. Parker and Philip Rothman,
“Further Evidence on the Stabilization of Postwar Economic Fluctuations,” Journal of Macroeconomics,
Spring 1996, pp. 289–298. Romer was the ﬁrst to emphasize the potential importance of the change in
business cycle dating methodology.
ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. Figure 8.1 shows that business cycle peaks and
troughs are identified with peaks and troughs in the
level of aggregate economic activity, which is consistent
with current NBER methodology. However, for business
cycles before 1927, the NBER identified business cycle
peaks and troughs with peaks and troughs in detrended
aggregate economic activity (aggregate economic activ-
ity minus the “normal growth path” shown in Fig. 8.1).
Show that this alternative methodology implies that
peaks occur earlier and that troughs occur later than you
would find when using the current methodology.
Compared to the current methodology, does the alterna-
tive methodology increase or decrease the computed
length of contractions and expansions? How might this
change in measurement account for the differences in
the average measured lengths of expansions and con-
tractions since World War II compared to the period
before World War I?
17
2. Consumer expenditures on durable goods such as cars
and furniture, as well as purchases of new houses, fall
much more than expenditures on nondurable goods
and services during most recessions. Why do you
think that is?
3. Output, total hours worked, and average labor produc-
tivity all are procyclical.
a. Which variable, output or total hours worked,
increases by a larger percentage in expansions and
falls by a larger percentage in recessions? (Hint: Aver-
age labor productivity = output , total hours worked,
so that the percentage change in average labor pro-
ductivity equals the percentage change in output
minus the percentage change in total hours worked.)
b. How is the procyclical behavior of average labor
productivity related to Okun’s Law, discussed in
Chapter 3?
4. During the period 1973–1975, the United States expe-
rienced a deep recession with a simultaneous sharp
rise in the price level. Would you conclude that the
recession was the result of a supply shock or a
demand shock? Illustrate, using AD–AS analysis.
5. It is sometimes argued that economic growth that is
“too rapid” will be associated with inflation. Use
AD–AS analysis to show how this statement might be
true. When this claim is made, what type of shock is
implicitly assumed to be hitting the economy?

3. It has been argued that the stock market predicts
recessions. Using quarterly data since 1961, plot the
real value of the stock market index (the S&P 500
index in the last month of the quarter divided by the
GDP deﬂator). [Note that data on the S&P 500 index
may be found at ﬁnance.yahoo.com.] Draw in the busi-
ness cycle peaks and troughs. Do you ﬁnd the stock
market to be a good economic forecaster?
4. Graph the levels of real GDP for the United States,
Canada, and Germany (data can be found at 
www.oecd.org under Statistics and then under National
Accounts). Are U.S. and Canadian business cycles close-
ly related? U.S. and German business cycles?
5. In the FRED database, ﬁnd a variable that is available in
both a seasonally adjusted form and a not seasonally
adjusted form. Plot both over time and describe how
large the seasonal variation in the variable is.

CHAPTER 9
The IS–LM/AD –AS Model:
A General Framework for
Macroeconomic Analysis
The main goal of Chapter 8 was to describe business cycles by presenting the
business cycle facts. This and the following two chapters attempt to explain busi-
ness cycles and how policymakers should respond to them. First, we must devel-
op a macroeconomic model that we can use to analyze cyclical fluctuations and
the effects of policy changes on the economy. By examining the labor market in
Chapter 3, the goods market in Chapter 4, and the asset market in Chapter 7, we
already have identified the three components of a complete macroeconomic
model. Now we put these three components together into a single framework
that allows us to analyze them simultaneously. This chapter, then, consolidates
our previous analyses to provide the theoretical structure for the rest of the
book.
The basic macroeconomic model developed in this chapter is known as the
IS–LM model. (As we discuss later, this name originates in two of its basic equilibri-
um conditions: that investment, I, must equal saving, S, and that money demanded,
L, must equal money supplied, M.) The IS–LM model was developed in 1937 by
Nobel laureate Sir John Hicks,
1
who intended it as a graphical representation of the
ideas presented by Keynes in his famous 1936 book, The General Theory of Employ-
ment, Interest, and Money. Reﬂecting Keynes’s belief that wages and prices don’t
adjust quickly to clear markets (see Section 1.3), in his original IS–LM model Hicks
assumed that the price level was ﬁxed, at least temporarily . Since Hicks, several gen-
erations of economists have worked to reﬁne the IS–LM model, and it has been
widely applied in analyses of cyclical ﬂuctuations and macroeconomic policy, and
in forecasting.
Because of its origins, the IS–LM model is commonly identiﬁed with the Key-
nesian approach to business cycle analysis. Classical economists—who believe that
wages and prices move rapidly to clear markets—would reject Hicks’s IS–LM
model because of his assumption that the price level is ﬁxed. However, the conven-
tional IS–LM model may be easily adapted to allow for rapidly adjusting wages
1
Hicks outlined the IS–LM framework in an article entitled “Mr. Keynes and the Classics: A Suggested
Interpretation,” Econometrica, April 1937, pp. 137–159.
M09_ABEL4529_07_SE_C09.QXD  12/10/09  12:38 AM  Page 310
and prices. Thus the IS–LM framework, although originally developed by Keyne-
sians, also may be used to present and discuss the classical approach to business
cycle analysis. In addition, the IS–LM model is equivalent to the AD–AS model that
we previewed in Section 8.4. We show how the AD–AS model is derived from the
IS–LM model and illustrate how the AD–AS model can be used with either a clas-
sical or a Keynesian perspective.
Using the IS–LM model (and the equivalent AD–AS model) as a framework for
both classical and Keynesian analyses has several practical beneﬁts: First, it avoids
the need to learn two different models. Second, utilizing a single framework
emphasizes the large areas of agreement between the Keynesian and classical
approaches while showing clearly how the two approaches differ. Moreover,
because versions of the IS–LM model (and its concepts and terminology) are so often
applied in analyses of the economy and macroeconomic policy , studying this frame-
work will help you understand and participate more fully in current economic
debates.
We use a graphical approach to develop the IS–LM model. Appendix 9.B pre-
sents the identical analysis in algebraic form. If you have difﬁculty understanding
why the curves used in the graphical analysis have the slopes they do or why they
shift, you may ﬁnd the algebra in the appendix helpful.
To keep things as simple as possible, in this chapter we assume that the econ-
omy is closed. In Chapter 13 we show how to extend the analysis to allow for a
foreign sector.
9.1 The FE Line: Equilibrium in the Labor Market
In previous chapters, we discussed the three main markets of the economy: the
labor market, the goods market, and the asset market. We also identiﬁed some of
the links among these markets, but now we want to be more precise about how
they ﬁt into a complete macroeconomic system.
Let’s turn ﬁrst to the labor market and recall from Chapter 3 the concepts of the
full-employment level of employment and full-employment output. The full-
employment level of employment, , is the equilibrium level of employment reached
after wages and prices have fully adjusted. Full-employment output, is the amount
of output produced when employment is at its full-employment level, for the cur-
rent level of the capital stock and the production function. Algebraically, full-
employment output, equals where K is the capital stock, A is
productivity, and F is the production function (see Eq. 3.4).
Our ultimate goal is a diagram that has the real interest rate on the vertical axis
and output on the horizontal axis. In such a diagram equilibrium in the labor
market is represented by the full-employment line, or FE, in Fig. 9.1. The FE line
is vertical at because, when the labor market is in equilibrium, output equals
its full-employment level, regardless of the interest rate.

The real interest rate affects investment and thus the amount of capital that ﬁrms will have in the future,
but it doesn’t affect the current capital stock, and hence does not affect current full-employment output.

Factors That Shift the FE Line
The full-employment level of output is determined by the full-employment level of
employment and the current levels of capital and productivity . Any change that affects
the full-employment level of output, , will cause the FE line to shift. Recall that full-
employment output, , increases—and thus the FE line shifts to the right—when the
labor supply increases (which raises equilibrium employment ), when the capital
stock increases, or when there is a beneﬁcial supply shock. Similarly , a drop in the labor
supply or capital stock, or an adverse supply shock, lowers full-employment output, ,
and shifts the FE line to the left. Summary table 11 lists the factors that shift the FE line.

9.2 The IS Curve: Equilibrium in the Goods Market
The second of the three markets in our model is the goods market. Recall from
Chapter 4 that the goods market is in equilibrium when desired investment and
desired national saving are equal or, equivalently, when the aggregate quantity of
goods supplied equals the aggregate quantity of goods demanded. Recall that
adjustments in the real interest rate help bring about equilibrium in the goods
market.
In a diagram with the real interest rate on the vertical axis and real output on
the horizontal axis, equilibrium in the goods market is described by a curve called
the IS curve. For any level of output (or income), Y, the IS curve shows the real
interest rate, r, for which the goods market is in equilibrium. The IS curve is so
named because at all points on the curve desired investment, I
d
, equals desired
national saving, S
d
.
Figure 9.2 shows the derivation of the IS curve from the saving–investment dia-
gram introduced in Chapter 4 (see Key Diagram 3, p. 142). Figure 9.2(a) shows the
saving–investment diagram drawn for two randomly chosen levels of output, 4000
and 5000. Corresponding to each level is a saving curve, with the value of output
indicated in parentheses next to it. Each saving curve slopes upward because an
increase in the real interest rate causes households to increase their desired level of
saving. An increase in current output (income) leads to more desired saving at any
real interest rate, so the saving (S) curve for Y = 5000 lies to the right of the saving
(S) curve for Y = 4000.
Also shown in Fig. 9.2(a) is an investment curve. Recall from Chapter 4
that the investment curve slopes downward. It slopes downward because an
increase in the real interest rate increases the user cost of capital, which
reduces the desired capital stock and hence desired investment. Desired invest-
ment isn’t affected by current output, so the investment curve is the same
whether Y = 4000 or Y = 5000.
Each level of output implies a different market-clearing real interest rate. When
output is 4000, goods market equilibrium is at point D and the market-clearing real
interest rate is 7%. When output is 5000, goods market equilibrium occurs at point
F and the market-clearing real interest rate is 5%.
Figure 9.2(b) shows the IS curve for this economy, with output on the horizon-
tal axis and the real interest rate on the vertical axis. For any level of output, the IS
curve shows the real interest rate that clears the goods market. Thus Y = 4000 and
r = 7% at point D on the IS curve. (Note that point D in Fig. 9.2b corresponds to
point D in Fig. 9.2a.) Similarly, when output is 5000, the real interest rate that clears
the goods market is 5%. This combination of output and the real interest rate occurs
at point F on the IS curve in Fig. 9.2(b), which corresponds to point F in Fig. 9.2(a).
In general, because a rise in output increases desired national saving, thereby
reducing the real interest rate that clears the goods market, the IS curve slopes
downward.
The slope of the IS curve may also be interpreted in terms of the alternative
(but equivalent) version of the goods market equilibrium condition, which states
that in equilibrium the aggregate quantity of goods demanded must equal the
aggregate quantity of goods supplied. To illustrate, let’s suppose that the economy
is initially at point F in Fig. 9.2(b). The aggregate quantities of goods supplied and

We have just shown that desired national saving equals desired investment at point F, or S

Substituting the deﬁnition of desired national saving, Y - C

Figure 9.2
Deriving the IS curve
(a) The graph shows the goods market equilibrium for two different levels of output: 4000 and 5000 (the output correspond-
ing to each saving curve is indicated in parentheses next to the curve). Higher levels of output (income) increase desired
national saving and shift the saving curve to the right. When output is 4000, the real interest rate that clears the goods
market is 7% (point D). When output is 5000, the market-clearing real interest rate is 5% (point F).
(b) For each level of output the IS curve shows the corresponding real interest rate that clears the goods market. Thus each
point on the IS curve corresponds to an equilibrium point in the goods market. As in (a), when output is 4000, the real interest
rate that clears the goods market is 7% (point D); when output is 5000, the market-clearing real interest rate is 5% (point F).
Because higher output raises saving and leads to a lower market-clearing real interest rate, the IS curve slopes downward.

demanded are equal at point F because F lies on the IS curve, which means that the

Now suppose that for some reason the real interest rate r rises from 5% to 7%.
Recall from Chapter 4 that an increase in the real interest rate reduces both desired
consumption, C
d
(because people desire to save more when the real interest rate
rises), and desired investment, I
d
, thereby reducing the aggregate quantity of goods
demanded. If output, Y, remained at its initial level of 5000, the increase in the real
interest rate would imply that more goods were being supplied than demanded.
For the goods market to reach equilibrium at the higher real interest rate, the quan-
tity of goods supplied has to fall. At point D in Fig. 9.2(b), output has fallen enough

SUMMARY 12
(from 5000 to 4000) that the quantities of goods supplied and demanded are equal,
and the goods market has returned to equilibrium.
4
Again, higher real interest
rates are associated with less output in goods market equilibrium, so the IS curve
slopes downward.
Factors That Shift the IS Curve
For any level of output, the IS curve shows the real interest rate needed to clear the
goods market. With output held constant, any economic disturbance or policy change
that changes the value of the goods-market-clearing real interest rate will cause the
IS curve to shift. More speciﬁcally, for constant output, any change in the economy that
reduces desired national saving relative to desired investment will increase the real interest
rate that clears the goods market and thus shift the IS curve up and to the right. Similarly , for
constant output, changes that increase desired saving relative to desired investment,
thereby reducing the market-clearing real interest rate, shift the IS curve down and
to the left. Factors that shift the IS curve are described in Summary table 12.
4
Although a drop in output, Y, obviously reduces the quantity of goods supplied, it also reduces the
quantity of goods demanded. The reason is that a drop in output is also a drop in income, which
reduces desired consumption. However, although a drop in output of one dollar reduces the supply
of output by one dollar, a drop in income of one dollar reduces desired consumption, C
d
, by less than
one dollar (that is, the marginal propensity to consume, deﬁned in Chapter 4, is less than 1). Thus a
drop in output, Y, reduces goods supplied more than goods demanded and therefore reduces the
excess supply of goods.

316 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
We can use a change in current government purchases to illustrate IS curve
shifts in general. The effects of a temporary increase in government purchases on
the IS curve are shown in Fig. 9.3. Figure 9.3(a) shows the saving–investment dia-
gram, with an initial saving curve, S
1
, and an initial investment curve, I. The S
1
curve represents saving when output (income) is ﬁxed at Y = 4500. Figure 9.3(b)
shows the initial IS curve, IS
1
. The initial goods market equilibrium when output,
Y, equals 4500 is represented by point E in both (a) and (b). At E, the initial market-
clearing real interest rate is 6%.
Now suppose that the government increases its current purchases of goods, G.
Desired investment at any level of the real interest rate isn’t affected by the increase
in government purchases, so the investment curve doesn’t shift. However, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 4, a temporary increase in government purchases reduces
desired national saving, Y - C
d
- G (see Summary table 5, p. 118), so the saving
curve shifts to the left from S
1
to S
2
in Fig. 9.3(a). As a result of the reduction in
Figure 9.3
Effect on the IS curve of a temporary increase in government purchases
(a) The saving–investment diagram shows the effects of a temporary increase in government purchases, G, with output, Y,
constant at 4500. The increase in G reduces desired national saving and shifts the saving curve to the left, from S

to S
2
. The
goods market equilibrium point moves from point E to point F, and the real interest rate rises from 6% to 7%.
(b) The increase in G raises the real interest rate that clears the goods market for any level of output. Thus the IS curve shifts
up and to the right from IS
1
to IS
2
. In this example, with output held constant at 4500, an increase in government purchases
raises the real interest rate that clears the goods market from 6% (point E) to 7% (point F).

desired national saving, the real interest rate that clears the goods market when
output equals 4500 increases from 6% to 7% (point F in Fig. 9.3a).
The effect on the IS curve is shown in Fig. 9.3(b). With output constant at 4500,
the real interest rate that clears the goods market increases from 6% to 7%, as
shown by the shift from point E to point F. The new IS curve, IS
2
, passes through F
and lies above and to the right of the initial IS curve, IS
1
. Thus a temporary increase
in government purchases shifts the IS curve up and to the right.
So far our discussion of IS curve shifts has focused on the goods market equi-
librium condition that desired national saving must equal desired investment.
However, factors that shift the IS curve may also be described in terms of the alter-
native (but equivalent) goods market equilibrium condition—that the aggregate
quantities of goods demanded and supplied are equal. In particular, for a given
level of output, any change that increases the aggregate demand for goods shifts the IS
curve up and to the right.
This rule works because, for the initial level of output, an increase in the aggre-
gate demand for goods causes the quantity of goods demanded to exceed the
quantity supplied. Goods market equilibrium can be restored at the same level of
output by an increase in the real interest rate, which reduces desired consumption,
C
d
, and desired investment, I
d
. For any level of output, an increase in aggregate
demand for goods raises the real interest rate that clears the goods market, so we
conclude that an increase in the aggregate demand for goods shifts the IS curve up
and to the right.
To illustrate this alternative way of thinking about shifts in the IS curve, we
again use the example of a temporary increase in government purchases. Note
that an increase in government purchases, G, directly raises the demand for goods,
C
d
+ I
d
+ G, leading to an excess demand for goods at the initial level of output. The
excess demand for goods can be eliminated and goods market equilibrium at the
initial level of output restored by an increase in the real interest rate, which reduces
C
d
and I
d
. Because a higher real interest rate is required for goods market equilib-
rium when government purchases increase, an increase in G causes the IS curve to
shift up and to the right.
9.3 The LM Curve: Asset Market Equilibrium
The third and ﬁnal market in our macroeconomic model is the asset market, pre-
sented in Chapter 7. The asset market is in equilibrium when the quantities of
assets demanded by holders of wealth for their portfolios equal the supplies of
those assets in the economy. In reality, there are many different assets, both real
(houses, consumer durables, ofﬁce buildings) and ﬁnancial (checking accounts,
government bonds). Recall, however, that we aggregated all assets into two
categories—money and nonmonetary assets. We assumed that the nominal
supply of money is M and that money pays a fixed nominal interest rate, i
m
.
Similarly, we assumed that the nominal supply of nonmonetary assets is NM
and that these assets pay a nominal interest rate, i, and (given expected inﬂation,
π
e
) an expected real interest rate, r.
With this aggregation assumption, we showed that the asset market equilibrium
condition reduces to the requirement that the quantities of money supplied and
demanded be equal. In this section we show that asset market equilibrium can be

318 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
represented by the LM curve. However, to discuss how the asset market comes into
equilibrium—a task that we didn’t complete in Chapter 7—we ﬁrst introduce an
important relationship used every day by traders in ﬁnancial markets: the relation-
ship between the price of a nonmonetary asset and the interest rate on that asset.
The Interest Rate and the Price of a Nonmonetary Asset
The price of a nonmonetary asset, such as a government bond, is what a buyer has
to pay for it. Its price is closely related to the interest rate that it pays (sometimes
called its yield). To illustrate this relationship with an example, let’s consider a
bond that matures in one year. At maturity, we assume, the bondholder will
redeem it and receive $10,000; the bond doesn’t pay any interest before it matures.

Suppose that this bond can now be purchased for $9615. At this price, over the
coming year the bond will increase in value by $385 ($10,000 - $9615), or approxi-
mately 4% of its current price of $9615. Therefore the nominal interest rate on the
bond, or its yield, is 4% per year.
Now suppose that for some reason the current price of a $10,000 bond that
matures in one year drops to $9524. The increase in the bond’s value over the next
year will be $476 ($10,000 - $9524), or approximately 5% of the purchase price of
$9524. Therefore, when the current price of the bond falls to $9524, the nominal
interest rate on the bond increases to 5% per year. More generally, for the promised
schedule of repayments of a bond or other nonmonetary asset, the higher the price
of the asset, the lower the nominal interest rate that the asset pays. Thus a media
report that, in yesterday’s trading, the bond market “strengthened” (bond prices
rose), is equivalent to saying that nominal interest rates fell.
We have just indicated why the price of a nonmonetary asset and its nominal
interest rate are negatively related. For a given expected rate of inﬂation, π
e
, move-
ments in the nominal interest rate are matched by equal movements in the real
interest rate, so the price of a nonmonetary asset and its real interest rate are also
inversely related. This relationship is a key to deriving the LM curve and explain-
ing how the asset market comes into equilibrium.
The Equality of Money Demanded and Money Supplied
To derive the LM curve, which represents asset market equilibrium, we recall that
the asset market is in equilibrium only if the quantity of money demanded equals
the currently available money supply. We depict the equality of money supplied
and demanded using the money supply–money demand diagram, shown in Fig. 9.4(a).
The real interest rate is on the vertical axis and money, measured in real terms, is on
the horizontal axis.
6
The MS line shows the economy’s real money supply, M/P.
The nominal money supply, M, is set by the central bank. Thus, for a given price
level, P, the real money supply, M/P, is a ﬁxed number and the MS line is vertical.
For example, if M = 2000 and P = 2, the MS line is vertical at M/P = 1000.
5
A bond that doesn’t pay any interest before maturity is called a discount bond or a zero-coupon bond.
6
Asset market equilibrium may be expressed as either nominal money supplied equals nominal
money demanded, or as real money supplied equals real money demanded. As in Chapter 7, we
work with the condition expressed in real terms.

Figure 9.4
Deriving the LM curve
(a) The curves show real money demand and real money supply. Real money supply is ﬁxed at 1000. When output is 4000,
the real money demand curve is MD (Y = 4000); the real interest rate that clears the asset market is 3% (point A). When
output is 5000, more money is demanded at the same real interest rate, so the real money demand curve shifts to the right to
MD (Y = 5000). In this case the real interest rate that clears the asset market is 5% (point C).
(b) The graph shows the corresponding LM curve. For each level of output, the LM curve shows the real interest rate that clears
the asset market. Thus when output is 4000, the LM curve shows that the real interest rate that clears the asset market is 3%
(point A). When output is 5000, the LM curve shows a market-clearing real interest rate of 5% (point C). Because higher output
raises money demand, and thus raises the real interest rate that clears the asset market, the LM curve slopes upward.

Real money demand at two different levels of income, Y, is shown by the two
MD curves in Fig. 9.4(a). Recall from Chapter 7 that a higher real interest rate, r,
increases the relative attractiveness of nonmonetary assets and causes holders of
wealth to demand less money. Thus the money demand curves slope downward.
The money demand curve, MD, for Y = 4000 shows the real demand for money
when output is 4000; similarly, the MD curve for Y= 5000 shows the real demand
for money when output is 5000. Because an increase in income increases the
amount of money demanded at any real interest rate, the money demand curve for
Y= 5000 is farther to the right than the money demand curve for Y= 4000.
Graphically, asset market equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the money
supply and money demand curves, where the real quantities of money supplied
and demanded are equal. For example, when output is 4000, so that the money
demand curve is MD (Y = 4000), the money demand and money supply curves
intersect at point A in Fig. 9.4(a). The real interest rate at A is 3%. Thus when
output is 4000, the real interest rate that clears the asset market (equalizes the
M09_ABEL4529_07_SE_C09.QXD  12/10/09  12:39 AM  Page 319
320 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
quantities of money supplied and demanded) is 3%. At a real interest rate of 3%
and an output of 4000, the real quantity of money demanded by holders of wealth
is 1000, which equals the real money supply made available by the central bank.
What happens to the asset market equilibrium if output rises from 4000 to
5000? People need to conduct more transactions, so their real money demand
increases at any real interest rate. As a result, the money demand curve shifts to the
right, to MD (Y = 5000). If the real interest rate remained at 3%, the real quantity of
money demanded would exceed the real money supply. At point B in Fig. 9.4(a) the
real quantity of money demanded is 1200, which is greater than the real money
supply of 1000. To restore equality of money demanded and supplied and thus
bring the asset market back into equilibrium, the real interest rate must rise to 5%.
When the real interest rate is 5%, the real quantity of money demanded declines to
1000, which equals the ﬁxed real money supply (point C in Fig. 9.4a).
How does an increase in the real interest rate eliminate the excess demand for
money, and what causes this increase in the real interest rate? Recall that the prices
of nonmonetary assets and the interest rates they pay are negatively related. At the
initial real interest rate of 3%, the increase in output from 4000 to 5000 causes
people to demand more money (the MD curve shifts to the right in Fig. 9.4a). To
satisfy their desire to hold more money, people will try to sell some of their
nonmonetary assets for money. But when people rush to sell a portion of their
nonmonetary assets, the prices of these assets will fall, which will cause the real
interest rates on these assets to rise. Thus it is the public’s attempt to increase its
holdings of money by selling nonmonetary assets that causes the real interest
rate to rise.
Because the real supply of money in the economy is ﬁxed, the public as a
whole cannot increase the amount of money it holds. As long as people attempt to
do so by selling nonmonetary assets, the real interest rate will continue to rise. But
the increase in the real interest rate paid by nonmonetary assets makes those assets
more attractive relative to money, reducing the real quantity of money demanded
(here the movement is along the MD curve for Y = 5000, from point B to point C in
Fig. 9.4a). The real interest rate will rise until the real quantity of money demand-
ed again equals the ﬁxed supply of money and restores asset market equilibrium.
The new asset market equilibrium is at C, where the real interest rate has risen from
3% to 5%.
The preceding example shows that when output rises, increasing real money
demand, a higher real interest rate is needed to maintain equilibrium in the asset
market. In general, the relationship between output and the real interest rate that
clears the asset market is expressed graphically by the LM curve. For any level of
output, the LM curve shows the real interest rate for which the asset market is in
equilibrium, with equal quantities of money supplied and demanded. The term LM
comes from the asset market equilibrium condition that the real quantity of money
demanded, as determined by the real money demand function, L, must equal the
real money supply, M/P.
The LM curve corresponding to our numerical example is shown in Fig.
9.4(b), with the real interest rate, r, on the vertical axis and output, Y, on the hor-
izontal axis. Points A and C lie on the LM curve. At A, which corresponds to point
A in the money supply–money demand diagram of Fig. 9.4(a), output, Y, is 4000
and the real interest rate, r, is 3%. Because A lies on the LM curve, when output
is 4000 the real interest rate that clears the asset market is 3%. Similarly, because
C lies on the LM curve, when output is 5000 the real interest rate that equalizes
M09_ABEL4529_07_SE_C09.QXD  12/10/09  12:39 AM  Page 320
Chapter 9 The IS–LM/AD–AS Model 321
money supplied and demanded is 5%; this output–real interest rate combination
corresponds to the asset market equilibrium at point C in Fig. 9.4(a).
Figure 9.4(b) illustrates the general point that the LM curve always slopes
upward from left to right. It does so because increases in output, by raising money
demand, also raise the real interest rate on nonmonetary assets needed to clear the
asset market.
Factors That Shift the LM Curve
In deriving the LM curve we varied output but held constant other factors, such as
the price level, that affect the real interest rate that clears the asset market. Changes
in any of these other factors will cause the LM curve to shift. In particular, for con-
stant output, any change that reduces real money supply relative to real money demand
will increase the real interest rate that clears the asset market and cause the LM curve to
shift up and to the left. Similarly, for constant output, anything that raises real money
supply relative to real money demand will reduce the real interest rate that clears
the asset market and shift the LM curve down and to the right. Here we discuss in
general terms how changes in real money supply or demand affect the LM curve.
Summary table 13 describes the factors that shift the LM curve.
Changes in the Real Money Supply. An increase in the real money supply M/P
will reduce the real interest rate that clears the asset market and shift the LM
curve down and to the right. Figure 9.5 illustrates this point and extends our
previous numerical example.

suppose that the real money supply M/P is 1000 and output is 4000, so the money

demand curve is MD (Y = 4000). Then equilibrium in the asset market occurs at
point A with a market-clearing real interest rate of 3%. The LM curve correspond-
ing to the real money supply of 1000 is shown as LM (M/P= 1000) in Fig. 9.5(b). At
point A on this LM curve, as at point A in the money supply–money demand dia-
gram in Fig. 9.5(a), output is 4000 and the real interest rate is 3%. Because A lies on
the initial LM curve, when output is 4000 and the money supply is 1000, the real
interest rate that clears the asset market is 3%.
Now suppose that, with output constant at 4000, the real money supply rises
from 1000 to 1200. This increase in the real money supply causes the vertical money
supply curve to shift to the right, from MS
1
to MS
2
in Fig. 9.5(a). The asset market
equilibrium point is now point D, where, with output remaining at 4000, the
market-clearing real interest rate has fallen to 2%.
Why has the real interest rate that clears the asset market fallen? At the ini-
tial real interest rate of 3%, there is an excess supply of money—that is, holders
of wealth have more money in their portfolios than they want to hold and,

. For a constant level
of output, the real interest rate that clears the asset market falls. If output is ﬁxed at 4000, for example, the money demand
curve is MD (Y = 4000) and the real interest rate that clears the asset market falls from 3% (point A) to 2% (point D).
(b) The graph shows the effect of the increase in real money supply on the LM curve. For any level of output, the increase in
the real money supply causes the real interest rate that clears the asset market to fall. So, for example, when output is 4000,
the increase in the real money supply causes the real interest rate that clears the asset market to fall from 3% (point A) to 2%
(point D). Thus the LM curve shifts down and to the right, from LM (M/P = 1000) to LM (M/P = 1200).

consequently, they have a smaller share of their wealth than they would like in
nonmonetary assets. To eliminate this imbalance in their portfolios, holders of
wealth will want to use some of their money to buy nonmonetary assets. How-
ever, when holders of wealth as a group try to purchase nonmonetary assets, the
price of nonmonetary assets is bid up and hence the real interest rate paid on
these assets declines. As the real interest rate falls, nonmonetary assets become
less attractive relative to money. The real interest rate continues to fall until it
reaches 2% at point D in Fig. 9.5(a), where the excess supply of money and the
excess demand for nonmonetary assets are eliminated and the asset market is
back in equilibrium.
The effect of the increase in the real money supply on the LM curve is illustrated
in Fig. 9.5(b). With output constant at 4000, the increase in the real money supply
lowers the real interest rate that clears the asset market, from 3% to 2%. Thus point D,
where Y= 4000 and r= 2%, is now a point of asset market equilibrium, and point A no
longer is. More generally , for any level of output, an increase in the real money supply
lowers the real interest rate that clears the asset market. Therefore the entire LM curve
shifts down and to the right. The new LM curve, for M/P= 1200, passes through the
new equilibrium point D and lies below the old LM curve, for M/P= 1000.
Thus, with ﬁxed output, an increase in the real money supply lowers the real
interest rate that clears the asset market and causes the LM curve to shift down and
to the right. A similar analysis would show that a drop in the real money supply
causes the LM curve to shift up and to the left.
What might cause the real money supply to increase? In general, because the
real money supply equals M/P, it will increase whenever the nominal money
supply, M, which is controlled by the central bank, grows more quickly than the
price level, P.
Changes in Real Money Demand. A change in any variable that affects real
money demand, other than output or the real interest rate, will also shift the LM
curve. More speciﬁcally, with output constant, an increase in real money demand
raises the real interest rate that clears the asset market and thus shifts the LM
curve up and to the left. Analogously, with output constant, a drop in real money
demand shifts the LM curve down and to the right.
Figure 9.6 shows a graphical analysis of an increase in money demand similar
to that for a change in money supply shown in Fig. 9.5. As before, the money
supply–money demand diagram is shown on the left, Fig. 9.6(a). Output is constant
at 4000, and the real money supply again is 1000. The initial money demand curve
is MD
1
. The initial asset market equilibrium point is at A, where the money
demand curve, MD
1
, and the money supply curve, MS, intersect. At initial equilib-
rium, point A, the real interest rate that clears the asset market is 3%.
Now suppose that, for a fixed level of output, a change occurs in the econ-
omy that increases real money demand. For example, if banks decided to
increase the interest rate paid on money, i
m
, the public would want to hold
more money at the same levels of output and the real interest rate. Graphical-
ly, the increase in money demand shifts the money demand curve to the right,
from MD
1
to MD
2
in Fig. 9.6(a). At the initial real interest rate of 3%, the real
quantity of money demanded is 1300, which exceeds the available supply of
1000; so 3% is no longer the value of the real interest rate that clears the
asset market.

How will the real interest rate that clears the asset market change after the
increase in money demand? If holders of wealth want to hold more money, they
will exchange nonmonetary assets for money. Increased sales of nonmonetary
assets will drive down their price and thus raise the real interest rate that they pay.
The real interest rate will rise, reducing the attractiveness of holding money, until
the public is satisﬁed to hold the available real money supply (1000). The real
interest rate rises from its initial value of 3% at A to 6% at G.
Figure 9.6(b) shows the effect of the increase in money demand on the LM
curve. The initial LM curve, LM
1
, passes through point A, showing that when
output is 4000, the real interest rate that clears the asset market is 3%. (Point A in
Fig. 9.6b corresponds to point A in Fig. 9.6a.) Following the increase in money
demand, with output ﬁxed at 4000, the market-clearing real interest rate rises to 6%.
Thus the new LM curve must pass through point G (corresponding to point G in
Fig. 9.6a), where Y = 4000 and r = 6%. The new LM curve, LM
2
, is higher than LM
1
because the real interest rate that clears the asset market is now higher for any level
of output.

9.4 General Equilibrium in the Complete IS–LM Model
The next step is to put the labor market, the goods market, and the asset market
together and examine the equilibrium of the economy as a whole. A situation in
which all markets in an economy are simultaneously in equilibrium is called a
general equilibrium. Figure 9.7 shows the complete IS–LM model, illustrating
how the general equilibrium of the economy is determined. Shown are:
■ the full-employment, or FE, line, along which the labor market is in equilibrium;
■ the IS curve, along which the goods market is in equilibrium; and
■ the LM curve, along which the asset market is in equilibrium.
The three curves intersect at point E, indicating that all three markets are in
equilibrium at that point. Therefore E represents a general equilibrium and,
because it is the only point that lies on all three curves, the only general equilibri-
um for this economy.
Although point E obviously is a general equilibrium point, not so clear is
which forces, if any, act to bring the economy to that point. To put it another way,
although the IS curve and FE line must intersect somewhere, we haven’t explained
why the LM curve must pass through that same point. In Section 9.5 we discuss the
economic forces that lead the economy to general equilibrium. There we show that
(1) the general equilibrium of the economy always occurs at the intersection of the
IS curve and the FE line; and (2) adjustments of the price level cause the LM curve
to shift until it passes through the general equilibrium point deﬁned by the inter-
section of the IS curve and the FE line. Before discussing the details of this adjust-
ment process, however, let’s consider an example that illustrates the use of the
complete IS–LM model.
M09_ABEL4529_07_SE_C09.QXD  12/10/09  12:39 AM  Page 325
326 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
Applying the IS–LM Framework: A Temporary 
Adverse Supply Shock
An economic shock relevant to business cycle analysis is an adverse supply shock.
Speciﬁcally, suppose that (because of bad weather or a temporary increase in oil
prices) the productivity parameter, A, in the production function drops
temporarily.
7
We can use the IS–LM model to analyze the effects of this shock on
the general equilibrium of the economy and the general equilibrium values of eco-
nomic variables such as the real wage, employment, output, the real interest rate,
the price level, consumption, and investment.
Suppose that the economy is initially in general equilibrium at point E in
Fig. 9.8(a), where the initial FE line, FE
1
, IS curve, and LM curve, LM
1
, for this
economy intersect. To determine the effects of a temporary supply shock on the
general equilibrium of this economy, we must consider how the temporary drop
in productivity A affects the positions of the FE line and the IS and LM curves.
The FE line describes equilibrium in the labor market. Hence to ﬁnd the effect
of the supply shock on the FE line we must ﬁrst look at how the shock affects
labor supply and labor demand. In Chapter 3 we demonstrated that an adverse
supply shock reduces the marginal product of labor and thus shifts the labor
demand curve down (see Fig. 3.11). Because the supply shock is temporary, we
assume that it doesn’t affect workers’ wealth or expected future wages and so
doesn’t affect labor supply. As a result of the decline in labor demand, the equilib-
rium values of the real wage and employment, , fall.
The FE line shifts only to the degree that full-employment output, , changes.
Does change? Yes. Recall from Chapter 3 that an adverse supply shock reduces
full-employment output, , which equals , for two reasons: (1) as we just
mentioned, the supply shock reduces the equilibrium level of employment, ,
which lowers the amount of output that can be produced; and (2) the drop in pro-
ductivity A directly reduces the amount of output produced by any combination of
capital and labor. The reduction in is represented by a shift to the left of the FE
line, from FE
1
to FE
2
in Fig. 9.8(b).
Now consider the effects of the temporary adverse supply shock on the IS
curve. Recall that we derived the IS curve by changing the level of current output
in the saving–investment diagram (Fig. 9.2) and ﬁnding for each level of current
output the real interest rate for which desired saving equals desired investment. A
temporary adverse supply shock reduces current output but doesn’t change any
other factor affecting desired saving or investment (such as wealth, expected future
income, or the future marginal product of capital). Therefore a temporary supply
shock is just the sort of change in current output that we used to trace out the IS
curve. We conclude that a temporary adverse supply shock is a movement along the
IS curve, not a shift of the IS curve, leaving it unchanged.
8
Finally, we consider the LM curve. A temporary supply shock has no direct
effect on the demand or supply of money and thus doesn’t shift the LM curve.
We now look for the new general equilibrium of the economy. In Fig. 9.8(b),
there is no point at which FE
2
(the new FE line), IS, and LM
1
all intersect. As we

Recall that the production function, Eq. (3.1), is Y = AF(K, N), so a drop in A reduces the amount of
output that can be produced for any quantities of capital, K, and labor, N.

Analytical Problem 2 at the end of the chapter examines the effect of a permanent adverse supply
shock and identiﬁes factors that shift the IS curve in that case.

the LM curve don’t intersect at a common point, the LM curve shifts until it passes
through the intersection of the FE line and IS curve. This shift in the LM curve is
caused by changes in the price level, P, which change the real money supply, M/P,
and thus affect the equilibrium of the asset market. As Fig. 9.8(b) shows, to restore
general equilibrium at point F, the LM curve must shift up and to the left, from LM
1
to LM
2
. For it to do so, the real money supply M/P must fall (see Summary table 13,
p. 321) and thus the price level, P, must rise. We infer (although we haven’t yet
given an economic explanation) that an adverse supply shock will cause the price
level to rise.
What is the effect of a temporary supply shock on the inflation rate, as dis-
tinct from the price level? As the inflation rate is the growth rate of the price
level, during the period in which prices are rising to their new, higher level, a
burst of inflation will occur. However, after the price level stabilizes at its higher
value (and is no longer rising), inflation will subside. Thus a temporary supply
shock should cause a temporary, rather than a permanent, increase in the rate of
inflation.

Let’s pause and review our results.
1. As we had already shown in Chapter 3, a temporary adverse supply shock
lowers the equilibrium values of the real wage and employment.
2. Comparing the new general equilibrium, point F, to the old general equilibri-
um, point E, in Fig. 9.8(b), we see that the supply shock lowers output and
raises the real interest rate.
3. The supply shock raises the price level and causes a temporary burst of inﬂation.
4. Because in the new general equilibrium the real interest rate is higher and
output is lower, consumption must be lower than before the supply shock.
The higher real interest rate also implies that investment must be lower after
the shock.
In the Application “Oil Price Shocks Revisited,” we check out how well our
model explains the historical behavior of the economy. Note that economic models,
such as the IS–LM model, also are used extensively in forecasting economic condi-
tions (“In Touch with Data and Research: Econometric Models and Macroeconom-
ic Forecasts for Economic Policy Analysis”).
APPLICATION
Oil Price Shocks Revisited
In Chapter 3 we pointed out that an increase in the price of oil is an example of an
adverse supply shock, and we looked at the effects of the 1973–1974 and 1979–1980
oil price shocks on the U.S. economy (see the Application “Output, Employment,
and the Real Wage During Oil Price Shocks,” p. 85). The theory’s predictions—that
adverse supply shocks reduce output, employment, and the real wage—were con-
ﬁrmed for those two episodes. Our analysis using the complete IS–LM model is con-
sistent with that earlier discussion. However, it adds the predictions that, following
an oil price shock, consumption and investment decline, inﬂation increases, and the
real interest rate rises.
Figure 8.7 shows that consumption fell slightly and that investment fell sharply
immediately after these oil price shocks. From the beginning of the recession in the
fourth quarter of 1973 until the fourth quarter of 1974, real consumption fell by
1.8% and real investment fell by 11.1%. Following the onset of the recession in the
ﬁrst quarter of 1980, real consumption fell by 2.3% and real investment fell by
9.0% in just one quarter. Inﬂation also behaved as predicted by our analysis, surg-
ing temporarily in 1973–1974 and again in 1979–1980 (see Fig. 8.13).
Our analysis also predicted that an oil price shock will cause the real interest
rate to rise. However, this result depends somewhat on the assumption we made
that people expected the oil price shock to be temporary. In Analytical Problem 2 at
the end of the chapter, you will ﬁnd that, if the adverse supply shock is expected to
be permanent, the rise in the real interest rate will be less than when the adverse
supply shock is expected to be temporary (and the real interest rate may not rise).
However, we don’t really know what people’s expectations were about the dura-
tion of the two major oil price shocks. Therefore we can’t state with conﬁdence

Chapter 9 The IS–LM/AD–AS Model 329
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Econometric Models and Macroeconomic 
Forecasts for Monetary Policy Analysis
The IS–LM model developed in this chapter is a relatively simple example of a
macroeconomic model. Much more complicated models of the economy (many,
though not all of them, based on the IS–LM framework) are used in applied macro-
economic research and analysis.
A common use of macroeconomic models is to help economists forecast the
course of the economy. In general, using a macroeconomic model to obtain quanti-
tative economic forecasts involves three steps. First, numerical values for the para-
meters of the model (such as the income elasticity of money demand) must be
obtained. In econometric models, these values are estimated through statistical analy-
ses of the data. Second, projections must be made of the likely behavior of relevant
exogenous variables, or variables whose values are not determined within the model.
Examples of exogenous variables include policy variables (such as government
spending and the money supply), oil prices, and changes in productivity. Third,
based on the expected path of the exogenous variables and the model parameters,
the model can be solved (usually on a computer) to give forecasts of variables deter-
mined within the model (such as output, employment, and interest rates). Vari-
ables determined within the model are endogenous variables.
Although a relatively simple model like the IS–LM model developed in this
chapter could be used to create real forecasts, the results probably would not be
very good. Because real-world economies are complex, macroeconomic models
actually used in forecasting tend to be much more detailed than the IS–LM model
presented here. For example, the Federal Reserve Board has long had such a model
in place for analyzing the economy and for developing forecasts for use in mone-
tary policy.
In 1996, the Federal Reserve Board produced a new model for policy analysis
and forecasting, known as the FRB/US model, and has been continually upgrading
the model since then. FRB/US was based on a previous model known as the MPS
model, which was developed closely from the theoretical IS–LM model but with
hundreds of equations representing different industries and sectors of the economy.
The new FRB/US model differed from the old MPS model in a number of ways: It
featured a much better ability to handle people’s expectations about the future values
of inﬂation and other variables, improved modeling of people’s and ﬁrms’ reactions
to economic shocks, and used newer statistical techniques to estimate the model.
what the effect of such a shock on the real interest rate should have been. Actually,
the real interest rate rose during the 1979–1980 shock but not during the 1973–1974
shock (see Fig. 2.3). On the basis of these data only, our model suggests that people
expected the 1973–1974 oil shock to be permanent and the 1979–1980 shock to be
temporary. Interestingly, those expectations were essentially correct: Figure 3.12
shows that the oil price increase of 1979–1980 was reversed rather quickly but that
the price increase of 1973–1974 was not.

9.5 Price Adjustment and the Attainment of General Equilibrium
We now explain the economic forces that lead prices to change and shift the LM
curve until it passes through the intersection of the IS curve and the FE line. In dis-
cussing the role of price adjustments in bringing the economy back to general
equilibrium, we also show the basic difference between the two main approaches
to business cycle analysis, classical and Keynesian.
To illustrate the adjustment process, let’s use the complete IS–LM model to con-
sider what happens to the economy if the nominal money supply increases. This
analysis allows us to discuss monetary policy (the control of the money supply)
and to introduce some ongoing controversies about the effects of monetary policy
on the economy.
The staff economists at the Federal Reserve Board now use the model as a
workhorse for policy analysis. They apply results from the model to analyze alter-
native monetary policy scenarios—for example, what would happen to the econo-
my over the next two years if the Fed raised the Federal funds interest rate to 5%,
compared with a scenario in which the rate were set at a lower level, such as 2%.
This analysis gives policymakers an idea of how policy affects the economy and
what are the likely outcomes of policy choices.
The model contains three main sectors of the economy, just as the IS–LM
model does: households, ﬁrms, and ﬁnancial markets. Households supply labor,
as we discussed in Section 3.3, and decide how much to consume and save, as we
saw in Section 4.1 and Appendix 4.A. Firms maximize their profits, choosing
appropriate levels of investment, as we discussed in Section 4.2, and demand
labor, as we saw in Section 3.2. Firms’ and households’ demand and supply of
ﬁnancial assets determine equilibrium in the ﬁnancial markets, as we discussed in
Chapter 7. The model is solved with general equilibrium concepts, as we showed
in Sections 3.4 for labor markets, 4.3 for goods markets, and 7.4 for asset markets.
Overall economic growth is governed by the principles discussed in Chapter 6.
Other assumptions of the model are based on new Keynesian theory, as we will
discuss in Chapter 11.
Although the model is quite detailed, no macro model is able to provide accu-
rate forecasts without some human judgment. So, to produce the forecasts that the
Fed uses internally in its Greenbook publication, the FRB/US model forecasts are
analyzed by the staff at the Federal Reserve Board and are often modiﬁed some-
what before being presented to monetary policymakers. The judgment of the staff
economists who are experts in various sectors of the economy is an important
input into the Greenbook forecasts. Evidently, this method of producing forecasts
works well, as the Greenbook forecasts have been found to be superior to private
sector forecasts.*

Chapter 9 The IS–LM/AD–AS Model 331
The Effects of a Monetary Expansion
Suppose that the central bank decides to raise the nominal money supply, M, by
10%. For now we hold the price level, P, constant so that the real money supply,
M/P, also increases by 10%. What effects will this monetary expansion have on the
economy? Figure 9.9 helps us answer this question with the complete IS–LM
model.
The three parts of Fig. 9.9 show the sequence of events involved in the analy-
sis. For simplicity, suppose that the economy initially is in general equilibrium so
that in Fig. 9.9(a) the IS curve, the FE line, and the initial LM curve, LM
1
, all pass
through the general equilibrium point, E. At E output equals its full-employment
value of 1000, and the real interest rate is 5%. Both the IS and LM curves pass
through E, so we know that 5% is the market-clearing real interest rate in both the
goods and asset markets. For the moment the price level, P, is ﬁxed at its initial
level of 100.
The 10% increase in the real supply of money, M/P, doesn’t shift the IS curve
or the FE line because, with output and the real interest rate held constant, a change
in M/P doesn’t affect desired national saving, desired investment, labor demand,
labor supply, or productivity. However, Fig. 9.5 showed that an increase in the real
money supply does shift the LM curve down and to the right, which we show here
as a shift of the LM curve from LM
1
to LM
2
, in Fig. 9.9(b). The LM curve shifts down
and to the right because, at any level of output, an increase in the money supply
lowers the real interest rate needed to clear the asset market.
Note that, after the LM curve has shifted down to LM
2
, there is no point in 
Fig. 9.9(b) at which all three curves intersect. In other words, the goods market, the
labor market, and the asset market no longer are simultaneously in equilibrium.
Figure 9.9
Effects of a monetary expansion
(a) The economy is in general equilibrium at point E.
Output equals the full-employment level of 1000, the real
interest rate is 5%, and the price level is 100.
(b) With the price level ﬁxed, a 10% increase in the nomi-
nal money supply, M, raises the real money supply, M/P,
and shifts the LM curve down and to the right from LM
1
to LM
2
. At point F, the intersection of the IS curve and the
new LM curve, LM
2
, the real interest rate has fallen to
3%, which raises the aggregate demand for goods.
If ﬁrms produce extra output to meet the increase in
aggregate demand, output rises to 1200 (higher than 
full-employment output of 1000).
(c) Because aggregate demand exceeds full-employment
output at point F, ﬁrms raise prices. A 10% rise in P, from
100 to 110, restores the real money supply to its original
level and shifts the LM curve back to its original position
at LM
1
. This returns the economy to point E, where
output again is at its full-employment level of 1000, but
the price level has risen 10% from 100 to 110.

332 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
We now must make some assumptions about how the economy behaves when it
isn’t in general equilibrium.
Of the three markets in the IS–LM model, the asset market (represented by the
LM curve) undoubtedly adjusts the most quickly, because ﬁnancial markets can
respond within minutes to changes in economic conditions. The labor market (the
FE line) is probably the slowest to adjust, because the process of matching workers
and jobs takes time and wages may be renegotiated only periodically. The adjust-
ment speed of the goods market (IS curve) probably is somewhere in the middle.
We assume that, when the economy isn’t in general equilibrium, the asset market
and the goods market are in equilibrium so that output and the real interest rate are
given by the intersection of the IS and LM curves. Note that, when the economy isn’t in
general equilibrium, the IS–LM intersection doesn’t lie on the FE line, so the labor
market isn’t in equilibrium.
Immediately after the increase in the nominal money supply, therefore, the
economy is out of general equilibrium with the level of output and the real inter-
est rate represented by point F in Fig. 9.9(b), where the new LM curve, LM
2
, inter-
sects the IS curve. At F, output (1200) is higher and the real interest rate (3%) is
lower than at the original general equilibrium, point E. We refer to F, the point at
which the economy comes to rest before any adjustment occurs in the price level,
as the short-run equilibrium point. (Although we refer to F as a short-run equilibri-
um point, keep in mind that only the asset and goods markets are in equilibrium
there—the labor market isn’t.)
In economic terms, why does the increase in the money supply shift the econo-
my to point F? The sequence of events can be described as follows: After the increase
in the money supply, holders of wealth are holding more money in their portfolios
than they desire at the initial values of output and the real interest rate. To bring

their portfolios back into balance, they will try to use their excess money to buy non-
monetary assets. However, as holders of wealth bid for nonmonetary assets, they
put upward pressure on the prices of those assets, which reduces their interest rate.
Thus, after an increase in the money supply, wealth-holders’ attempts to achieve
their desired mix of money and nonmonetary assets cause the interest rate to fall.
The drop in the real interest rate isn’t the end of the story, however. Because the
lower real interest rate increases the demand by households for consumption, C
d
,
and the demand by ﬁrms for investment, I
d
, the aggregate demand for goods rises.
Here we make a fundamental assumption, to which we return shortly: When
demanders increase their spending on goods, ﬁrms are willing (at least temporar-
ily) to produce enough to meet the extra demand for their output. After the decline
in the real interest rate raises the aggregate demand for goods, therefore, we
assume that ﬁrms respond by increasing production, leading to higher output at
the short-run equilibrium point, F.
To summarize, with the price level constant, an increase in the nominal money
supply takes the economy to the short-run equilibrium point, F, in Fig. 9.9(b), at
which the real interest rate is lower and output is higher than at the initial general
equilibrium point, E. We made two assumptions: (1) when the economy isn’t in
general equilibrium, the economy’s short-run equilibrium occurs at the intersection
of the IS and LM curves; and (2) when the aggregate demand for goods rises, ﬁrms
are willing (at least temporarily) to produce enough extra output to meet the
expanded demand.
The Adjustment of the Price Level. So far we have simply taken the price level,
P, as ﬁxed. In reality, prices respond to conditions of supply and demand in the
economy. The price level, P, refers to the price of output (goods), so to think about
how prices are likely to adjust in this example, let’s reconsider the effects of the
increase in the money supply on the goods market.
In Fig. 9.9(b), the short-run equilibrium point, F, lies on the IS curve, implying
that the goods market is in equilibrium at that point with equal aggregate quanti-
ties of goods supplied and demanded. Recall our assumption that ﬁrms are willing
to meet any increases in aggregate demand by producing more. In that sense, then,
the aggregate quantity of goods supplied equals the aggregate quantity of goods
demanded. However, in another sense the goods market is not in equilibrium at
point F. The problem is that, to meet the aggregate demand for goods at F, ﬁrms
have to produce more output than their full-employment level of output, . Full-
employment output, , is the level of output that maximizes ﬁrms’ proﬁts because
that level of output corresponds to the proﬁt-maximizing level of employment
(Chapter 3). Therefore, in meeting the higher level of aggregate demand, ﬁrms are
producing more output than they would like. In the sense that, at point F, the pro-
duction of goods by ﬁrms is not the level of output that maximizes their proﬁts, the
goods market isn’t truly in equilibrium.
At point F the aggregate demand for goods exceeds ﬁrms’ desired supply of
output, , so we can expect ﬁrms to begin raising their prices, causing the price
level, P, to rise. With the nominal money supply, M, set by the central bank, an
increase in the price level, P, lowers the real money supply, M/P, which in turn
causes the LM curve to shift up and to the left. Indeed, as long as the aggregate
quantity of goods demanded exceeds what ﬁrms want to supply, prices will keep
rising. Thus the LM curve will keep shifting up and to the left until the aggregate
quantity of goods demanded equals full-employment output. Aggregate demand

equals full-employment output only when the LM curve has returned to its initial
position, LM
1
in Fig. 9.9(c), where it passes through the original general equilibri-
um point, E. At E all three markets of the economy again are in equilibrium, with
output at its full-employment level.
Compare Fig. 9.9(c) to the initial situation in Fig. 9.9(a) and note that after the
adjustment of the price level the 10% increase in the nominal money supply has
had no effect on output or the real interest rate. Employment also is unchanged
from its initial value, as the economy has returned to its original level of output.
However, as a result of the 10% increase in the nominal money supply, the price
level is 10% higher (so that P = 110). How do we know that the price level changes
by exactly 10%? To return the LM curve to its original position, the increase in the
price level had to return the real money supply, M/P, to its original value. Because
the nominal money supply, M, was raised by 10%, to return M/P to its original
value, the price level, P, had to rise by 10% as well. Thus the change in the nominal
money supply causes the price level to change proportionally. This result is the
same result obtained in Chapter 7 (see Eq. 7.10), where we assumed that all markets
are in equilibrium.
Note that, because in general equilibrium the price level has risen by 10% but
real economic variables are unaffected, all nominal economic variables must also
rise by 10%. In particular, for the real wage to have the same value after prices have
risen by 10% as it did before, the nominal wage must rise by 10%. Thus the return
of the economy to general equilibrium requires adjustment of the nominal wage
(the price of labor) as well as the price of goods.
Trend Money Growth and Inflation. In Fig 9.9 we analyzed the effects of a one-
time 10% increase in the nominal money supply, followed by a one-time 10%
adjustment in the price level. In reality, in most countries the money supply and
the price level grow continuously. Our framework easily handles this situation.
Suppose that in some country both the nominal money supply, M, and the price
level, P, are growing steadily at 7% per year, which implies that the real money
supply, M/P, is constant. The LM curve depends on the real money supply, M/P,
so in this situation the LM curve won’t shift, even though the nominal money
supply and prices are rising.
Now suppose that for one year the money supply of this country is increased
an additional 3%—for a total of 10%—while prices rise 7%. Then the real money
supply, M/P, grows by 3% (10% minus 7%), and the LM curve shifts down and to
the right. Similarly, if for one year the nominal money supply increased by only 4%,
with inﬂation still at 7% per year, the LM curve would shift up and to the left,
reﬂecting the 3% drop (-3% = 4% - 7%) in the real money supply.
This example illustrates that changes in M or P relative to the expected or trend rate
of growth of money and inﬂation (7% in this example) shift the LM curve. Thus, when
we analyze the effects of “an increase in the money supply,” we have in mind an
increase in the money supply relative to the expected, or trend, rate of money
growth (for example, a rise from 7% to 10% growth for one year); by a “decrease in
the money supply,” we mean a drop relative to a trend rate (such as a decline from
7% to 4% growth in money). Similarly , if we say something like “the price level falls
to restore general equilibrium,” we don’t necessarily mean that the price level liter-
ally falls but only that it rises by less than its trend or expected rate of growth
would suggest.

Chapter 9 The IS–LM/AD–AS Model 335
9
The proposition that a free-market economy with ﬂexible prices is automatically self-correcting is
consistent with Adam Smith’s invisible-hand idea, discussed in Chapter 1.
Classical Versus Keynesian Versions of the IS–LM Model
Our diagrammatic analysis of the effects of a change in the money supply high-
lights two questions that are central to the debate between the classical and Keyne-
sian approaches to macroeconomics: (1) How rapidly does the economy reach
general equilibrium? and (2) What are the effects of monetary policy on the econ-
omy? We previewed the ﬁrst of these questions in Section 8.4, using the AD–AS
model. Now we examine both questions, using the IS–LM model.
Price Adjustment and the Self-Correcting Economy. In our analysis of the effects of a
monetary expansion, we showed that the economy is brought into general equilibrium
by adjustment of the price level. In graphical terms, if the intersection of the IS and
LM curves lies to the right of the FE line—so that the aggregate quantity of goods
demanded exceeds full-employment output, as in Fig. 9.9(b)—the price level will
rise. The increase in P shifts the LM curve up and to the left, reducing the quantity
of goods demanded, until all three curves intersect at the general equilibrium
point, as in Fig. 9.9(c). Similarly, if the IS–LM intersection lies to the left of the full-
employment line—so that desired spending on goods is below ﬁrms’ proﬁt-
maximizing level of output—ﬁrms will cut prices. A decrease in the price level
raises the real money supply and shifts the LM curve down and to the right, until
all three curves again intersect, returning the economy to general equilibrium.
There is little disagreement about the idea that, after some sort of economic dis-
turbance, price level adjustments will eventually restore the economy to general
equilibrium. However, as discussed in Section 8.4, the speed at which this process
takes place is a controversial issue in macroeconomics. Under the classical assump-
tion that prices are ﬂexible, the adjustment process is rapid. When prices are ﬂexible,
the economy is effectively self-correcting, automatically returning to full employment
after a shock moves it away from general equilibrium.
9
Indeed, if ﬁrms respond to
increased demand by raising prices rather than by temporarily producing more (as
we earlier assumed), the adjustment process would be almost immediate.
According to the opposing Keynesian view, however, sluggish adjustment of
prices (and of wages, the price of labor) might prevent general equilibrium from being
attained for a much longer period, perhaps even several years. While the economy is
not in general equilibrium, Keynesians argue, output is determined by the level of
aggregate demand, represented by the intersection of the IS and LM curves; the econ-
omy is not on the FE line, and the labor market is not in equilibrium. This assumption
of sluggish price adjustment, and the consequent disequilibrium in the labor market,
distinguishes the Keynesian version of the IS–LM model from the classical version.
Monetary Neutrality. Closely related to the issue of how fast the economy
reaches general equilibrium is the question of how a change in the nominal
money supply affects the economy. We showed that, after the economy reaches its
general equilibrium, an increase in the nominal money supply has no effect on
real variables such as output, employment, or the real interest rate but raises the
price level. Economists say that there is monetary neutrality, or simply that
M09_ABEL4529_07_SE_C09.QXD  12/10/09  12:39 AM  Page 335
336 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
money is neutral, if a change in the nominal money supply changes the price level
proportionally but has no effect on real variables. Our analysis shows that, after
the complete adjustment of prices, money is neutral in the IS–LM model.
The practical relevance of monetary neutrality is much debated by classicals
and Keynesians. The basic issue again is the speed of price adjustment. In the clas-
sical view a monetary expansion is rapidly transmitted into prices and has, at
most, a transitory effect on real variables; that is, the economy moves quickly from
the situation shown in Fig. 9.9(a) to the situation shown in Fig. 9.9(c), spending little
time in the position shown in Fig. 9.9(b). Keynesians agree that money is neutral
after prices fully adjust but believe that, because of slow price adjustment, the
economy may spend a long time in disequilibrium. During this period the
increased money supply causes output and employment to rise and the real inter-
est rate to fall (compare Fig. 9.9b with Fig. 9.9a).
In brief, Keynesians believe in monetary neutrality in the long run (after prices
adjust) but not in the short run. Classicals are more accepting of the view that
money is neutral even in the relatively short run. We return to the issue of mone-
tary neutrality when we develop the classical and Keynesian models of the busi-
ness cycle in more detail in Chapters 10 and 11.
9.6 Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
The IS–LM model introduced in this chapter is a complete model representing the gen-
eral equilibrium of the economy. In this section we use the IS–LM model to develop
the aggregate demand–aggregate supply (AD–AS) model, which we previewed in
Chapter 8. The AD–AS model appears to be different from the IS–LM model, but in
fact the two models are equivalent. They are based on the same assumptions about
economic behavior and price adjustment, and they give the same answers when used
to analyze the effects of various shocks on the economy. Why then do we bother to
present both models? The reason is that, depending on the issue being addressed, one
way of representing the economy may be more convenient than the other. The IS–LM
model relates the real interest rate to output, and the AD–AS model relates the price
level to output. Thus the IS–LM model is more useful for examining the effect of var-
ious shocks on the real interest rate and on variables, such as saving and investment,
that depend on the real interest rate. In Chapter 13, for example, when we discuss
international borrowing and lending in open economies, the behavior of the real
interest rate is crucial; therefore, in that chapter we emphasize the IS–LM approach.
However, for issues related to the price level, or inﬂation, use of the AD–AS model is
more convenient. For example, we rely on the AD–AS framework in Chapter 12 when
we describe the relationship between inﬂation and unemployment. Keep in mind,
though, that the choice of the IS–LM framework or the AD–AS framework is a matter
of convenience; the two models express the same basic macroeconomic theory.
The Aggregate Demand Curve
The aggregate demand curve shows the relation between the aggregate quantity of
goods demanded, C
d
+ I
d
+ G, and the price level, P. The aggregate demand curve
slopes downward, as does the demand curve for a single product (apples, for
example). Despite the superﬁcial similarity between the AD curve and the demand
M09_ABEL4529_07_SE_C09.QXD  12/10/09  12:39 AM  Page 336
Chapter 9 The IS–LM/AD–AS Model 337
curve for a speciﬁc good, however, there is an important difference between these
two types of curves. The demand curve for apples relates the demand for apples to
the price of apples relative to the prices of other goods. In contrast, the AD curve
relates the aggregate quantity of output demanded to the general price level. If the
prices of all goods increase by 10%, the price level, P, also increases by 10%, even
though all relative prices of goods remain unchanged. Nevertheless, the increase in
the price level reduces the aggregate quantity of goods demanded.
The reason that an increase in the price level, P, reduces the aggregate quanti-
ty of output demanded is illustrated in Fig. 9.10. Recall that, for a given price level,
the aggregate quantity of output that households, firms, and the government
choose to demand is where the IS curve and the LM curve intersect. Suppose that
the nominal money supply is M and that the initial price level is P
1
. Then the real
money supply is M/P
1
, and the initial LM curve is LM
1
in Fig. 9.10(a). The IS and
LM
1
curves intersect at point E, where the amount of output that households,
ﬁrms, and the government want to buy is Y
1
. Thus we conclude that, when the
price level is P
1
, the aggregate amount of output demanded is Y
1
.
Now suppose that the price level increases to P
2
. With a nominal money supply of
M, this increase in the price level reduces the real money supply from M/P
1
to M/P
2
.
Recall (Summary table 13, p. 321) that a decrease in the real money supply shifts the LM
curve up and to the left, to LM
2
. The IS and LM
2
curves intersect at point F, where the
aggregate quantity of output demanded is Y
2
. Thus the increase in the price level from
P
1
to P
2
reduces the aggregate quantity of output demanded from Y
1
to Y
2
.
This negative relation between the price level and the aggregate quantity of
output demanded is shown as the downward-sloping AD curve in Fig. 9.10(b).
Points E and F in Fig. 9.10(b) correspond to points E and F in Fig. 9.10(a), respec-
tively. The AD curve slopes downward because an increase in the price level
reduces the real money supply, which shifts the LM curve up and to the left; the
reduction in the real money supply increases the real interest rate, which reduces
the demand for goods by households and ﬁrms.
Factors That Shift the AD Curve. The AD curve relates the aggregate quantity of
output demanded to the price level. For a constant price level, any factor that
changes the aggregate demand for output will cause the AD curve to shift, with
increases in aggregate demand shifting the AD curve up and to the right and
decreases in aggregate demand shifting it down and to the left. Aggregate
demand is determined by the intersection of the IS and LM curves, so we can also
say that, holding the price level constant, any factor that causes the intersection of
the IS curve and the LM curve to shift to the right raises aggregate demand and
shifts the AD curve up and to the right. Similarly, for a constant price level, any
factor that causes the intersection of the IS and LM curves to shift to the left shifts
the AD curve down and to the left.
An example of a factor that shifts the AD curve up and to the right, which we
have considered before, is a temporary increase in government purchases. The effect
of the increase in government purchases on the AD curve is illustrated in Fig. 9.11.
The initial IS curve, IS
1
, intersects the LM curve at point E in Fig. 9.11(a) so that the
initial aggregate quantity of output demanded is Y
1
. As we have shown, a tempo-
rary increase in government purchases shifts the IS curve up and to the right to IS
2
.
With the price level held constant at its initial value of P
1
, the intersection of the IS
and LM curves moves to point F so that the aggregate quantity of output demand-
ed increases from Y
1
to Y
2
.

338 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
The shift of the AD curve resulting from the increase in government purchases
is shown in Fig. 9.11(b). The increase in the aggregate quantity of output demanded
at price level P
1
is shown by the movement from point E to point F. Because the
increase in government purchases raises the aggregate quantity of output demand-
ed at any price level, the entire AD curve shifts up and to the right, from AD
1
to AD
2
.
Other factors that shift the AD curve are listed in Summary table 14, p. 340, and an
algebraic derivation of the AD curve is presented in Appendix 9.B.

For a given price level,
the aggregate quantity of

sponding to point E in
both (a) and (b). To
derive the aggregate

ine what happens to the
quantity of output
demanded when the
price level changes.
(a) An increase in the

The Aggregate Supply Curve
The aggregate supply curve shows the relationship between the price level and the
aggregate amount of output that ﬁrms supply. Recall from the preview in Chapter 8
and our discussion of the IS–LM model that ﬁrms are assumed to behave differently
in the short run than in the long run. The assumption is that prices remain ﬁxed in the
short run and that ﬁrms supply the quantity of output demanded at this ﬁxed price

SUMMARY 14
Factors That Shift the AD Curve
For a constant price level, any factor that shifts the intersection of the IS and LM curves to the right increases
aggregate output demanded and shifts the AD curve up and to the right.
Factors that shift the IS curve up and to the right, and thus shift the AD curve up and to the right (see
Summary table 12, p. 315) include
■ an increase in expected future output;
■ an increase in wealth;
■ an increase in government purchases, G;
■ a reduction in taxes, T (assuming no Ricardian equivalence so that consumers respond by raising 
desired consumption);
■ an increase in the expected future MPK; and
■ a reduction in the effective tax rate on capital.
Factors that shift the LM curve down and to the right, and thus shift the AD curve up and to the right (see
Summary table 13, p. 321) include
■ an increase in the nominal money supply, M;
■ a rise in expected inflation, π
e
;
■ a decrease in the nominal interest rate on money, i
m
; and
■ any other change that reduces the real demand for money.

level. Thus the short-run aggregate supply curve, or SRAS, is a horizontal line, as
shown in Fig. 9.12.
In the long run, prices and wages adjust to clear all markets in the economy. In
particular, the labor market clears so that employment equals , which is the level
of employment that maximizes ﬁrms’ proﬁts. When employment equals , the
aggregate amount of output supplied is the full-employment level, , which equals Y

In the short run, ﬁrms
supply the amount of
output demanded at the
ﬁxed price, so the short-
run aggregate supply
(SRAS) curve is a horizon-
tal line. In the long run,
when the labor market
clears, ﬁrms supply the
full-employment level of
output, , regardless of
the price level. Thus the
long-run aggregate
supply (LRAS) curve is a
vertical line at . Y = Y

, regardless of the price level. In the long run, ﬁrms supply at any price
level, so the long-run aggregate supply curve, or LRAS, is a vertical line at ,
as shown in Fig. 9.12.
Factors That Shift the Aggregate Supply Curves. Any factor that increases the
full-employment level of output, , shifts the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS)
curve to the right, and any factor that reduces shifts the LRAS curve to the left.
Thus any change that shifts the FE line to the right in the IS–LM diagram also
shifts the LRAS curve to the right. For instance, an increase in the labor force
raises the full-employment levels of employment and output, shifting the LRAS
curve to the right.
The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts whenever firms change their
prices in the short run. Any factor, such as an increase in costs, that leads firms
to increase prices in the short run will shift the SRAS curve up, and any
factor that leads firms to decrease prices in the short run will shift the SRAS
curve down.
Equilibrium in the AD–AS Model
When we previewed the AD–AS model in Section 8.4, we introduced the distinc-
tion between short-run equilibrium (equilibrium when prices are ﬁxed) and long-
run equilibrium (equilibrium when prices have fully adjusted). Short-run
equilibrium is represented by the intersection of the AD and SRAS curves, as at
point E in Fig. 9.13. Long-run equilibrium is represented by the intersection of the
AD and LRAS curves, which is also at point E in Fig. 9.13. Thus point E represents
both the short-run and long-run equilibria of the economy. When the economy is in

Short-run equilibrium is
represented by the inter-
section of the AD and
SRAS curves at point E.
At short-run equilibrium,
prices are ﬁxed and ﬁrms
meet demand at those
prices. Long-run equilib-
rium, which occurs after
prices have fully adjust-
ed, is represented by the
intersection of the AD
and LRAS curves, also at
point E. Long-run equi-
librium is the same as
general equilibrium,
because in long-run equi-
librium all markets
clear.
M09_ABEL4529_07_SE_C09.QXD  12/10/09  12:39 AM  Page 341
342 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
long-run equilibrium, output equals its full-employment level, . Long-run equilib-
rium is the same as general equilibrium, because in long-run equilibrium all mar-
kets clear.
When the economy reaches general, or long-run, equilibrium, all three
curves—AD, SRAS, and LRAS—intersect at a common point, as in Fig. 9.13.
This condition isn’t a coincidence. As with the IS curve, the LM curve, and the FE
line, strong economic forces lead the economy to arrive eventually at a common
point of intersection of the three curves. Indeed, the forces leading the AD,
SRAS, and LRAS curves to intersect at a common point are the same as the
forces leading the IS curve, the LM curve, and FE line to intersect at a common
point. To illustrate, we use the AD–AS framework to examine the effects on the
economy of an increase in the money supply, which we previously analyzed
with the IS–LM model.
Monetary Neutrality in the AD–AS Model
Suppose that the economy is initially in equilibrium at point E in Fig. 9.14, where
the level of output is and the price level is P
1
, and that the money supply then
increases by 10%. In the IS–LM model an increase in the money supply shifts the
LM curve down and to the right, raising the aggregate quantity of output demand-
ed at any particular price level. Thus an increase in the money supply also shifts the
AD curve up and to the right, from AD
1
to AD
2
.
Moreover, when the money supply rises by 10%, points on the new AD curve are
those for which the price level is 10% higher at each level of output demanded. To see
why, compare points E and H. Because H lies on AD
2
and E lies on AD
1
, the
nominal money supply, M, is 10% higher at H than at E. However, the aggregate
quantity of output demanded is the same ( ) at H and E. The aggregate quanti-
ty of output demanded can be the same at H and E only if the real money supply,
M/P, which determines the position of the LM curve and hence the aggregate
quantity of output demanded, is the same at H and E. With the nominal money
supply 10% higher at H, for the real money supply to be the same at the two
points the price level at H must be 10% higher than at E. Therefore P
2
is 10%
higher than P
1
. Indeed, for every level of output, the price level is 10% higher on
AD
2
than on AD
1
.
In the short run, the price level remains ﬁxed, and the increase in the nominal
money supply shifts the aggregate demand curve from AD
1
to AD
2
. Thus the short-
run equilibrium moves from point E to point F (which corresponds to movement
from point E to point F in the IS–LM diagram in Fig. 9.9b). Thus in the short run the
increase in the nominal money supply increases output from to Y
2
, causing an
economic boom.
However, the economy won’t remain at point F indefinitely. Because the
amount of output, Y
2
, is higher than the proﬁt-maximizing level of output, ,
firms will eventually increase their prices. Rising prices cause the short-run
aggregate supply curve to shift up from SRAS
1
. Firms will increase their prices
until the quantity of output demanded falls to the profit-maximizing level of
output, . The new long-run equilibrium is represented by point H, where the
AD curve, the LRAS curve, and the new short-run aggregate supply curve, or
SRAS
2
, all intersect. In the new long-run equilibrium, the price level has increased
by 10%, which is the same amount that the nominal money supply has increased.

Figure 9.14
Monetary neutrality in
the AD–AS framework
If we start from general
equilibrium at point E, a
10% increase in the nom-
inal money supply shifts
the AD curve up and to
the right from AD
1
to
AD
2
. The points on the
new AD curve are those
for which the price level
is 10% higher at each
level of output demand-
ed, because a 10%
increase in the price level
is needed to keep the real
money supply, and thus
the aggregate quantity of
output demanded,
unchanged. In the new
short-run equilibrium at
point F, the price level is
unchanged, and output
is higher than its full-
employment level. In the
new long-run equilibri-
um at point H, output is
unchanged at , and the
price level P
2
is 10%
higher than the initial
price level P
1
. Thus
money is neutral in the
long run.
Y
Output is the same in the new long-run equilibrium at point H as at point E. Thus
we conclude that money is neutral in the long run, as we did when using the
IS–LM model.
Our analysis highlights the distinction between the short-run and long-run
effects of an increase in the money supply, but it leaves open the crucial question
of how long it takes the economy to reach long-run equilibrium. As we have
emphasized in both Chapter 8 and this chapter, classical and Keynesian econo-
mists have very different answers to this question. Classical economists argue
that the economy reaches its long-run equilibrium quickly. Indeed, in its strictest
form, the classical view is that the economy reaches long-run equilibrium almost
immediately, so that the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is the only
aggregate supply curve that matters [the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)
curve is irrelevant]. However, Keynesians argue that the economy may take years
to reach long-run equilibrium and that in the meantime output will differ from its
full-employment level. We elaborate on these points of view in Chapter 10, which
is devoted to the classical model, and in Chapter 11, which is devoted to the
Keynesian model.
CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. The IS–LM model represents the three main markets
of the economy—the labor market, the goods market,
and the asset market—simultaneously, in a diagram
that has the real interest rate on the vertical axis and
output on the horizontal axis. Although the IS–LM
model was originally developed by Keynesians, it
may be used to illustrate both classical and Keynesian
analyses of the economy.
2. In the IS–LM model, equilibrium in the labor market
is represented graphically by the full-employment,
or FE, line, which is vertical at full-employment
output. Factors that raise full-employment output

shift the FE line to the right, and factors that reduce
full-employment output shift the FE line to the left.
3. For any level of output, the IS curve shows the value
of the real interest rate that clears the goods market.
The IS curve slopes downward because higher
output leads to more desired saving and thus a lower
goods-market-clearing real interest rate. For constant
output, any change that reduces desired national
saving relative to desired investment increases the
real interest rate that clears the goods market and
shifts the IS curve up and to the right. Equivalently,
for constant output, any change that increases the
aggregate demand for goods increases the real inter-
est rate that clears the goods market and shifts the IS
curve up and to the right.
4. For any level of output, the LM curve identiﬁes the
real interest rate that equates the quantities of money
supplied and demanded and thus clears the asset
market. The LM curve slopes upward because an
increase in output raises money demand, implying
that a higher real interest rate is needed to clear the
asset market. With output fixed, any change that
reduces the money supply relative to money demand
increases the real interest rate that clears the asset
market and causes the LM curve to shift up and to
the left.
5. General equilibrium in the macroeconomy occurs
when all markets are in equilibrium. Graphically,
the general equilibrium point is where the IS curve,
the FE line, and the LM curve intersect. Price level
adjustments push the economy toward general
equilibrium. Specifically, changes in the price level,
P, change the real money supply, M/P, which
causes the LM curve to shift until it passes through
the point at which the FE line and the IS curve
intersect.
6. A temporary adverse supply shock causes the gener-
al equilibrium levels of the real wage, employment,
output, consumption, and investment to fall, and the
general equilibrium levels of the real interest rate and
price level to increase.
7. A change in the money supply is neutral if it leads to
a proportional change in the price level but doesn’t
affect real variables. In the IS–LM model, money is
neutral after prices have adjusted and the economy
has returned to general equilibrium.
8. The aggregate demand–aggregate supply (AD–AS)
model is based on the IS–LM model and in fact is
equivalent to it. However, the two models allow us to
focus on the behavior of different macroeconomic
variables: The IS–LM model is most useful for study-
ing the relationship between the real interest rate and
the level of output, whereas the AD–AS model
focuses on the relationship between the price level
and the level of output.
9. The aggregate demand (AD) curve relates the aggre-
gate quantity of output demanded—the level of
output at the intersection of the IS and LM curves—
to the price level. An increase in the price level
reduces the real money supply and shifts the LM
curve up and to the left, thereby reducing the aggre-
gate quantity of output demanded. Because an
increase in the price level reduces the aggregate
quantity of goods demanded, the aggregate demand
curve slopes downward. Factors that increase the
aggregate quantity of output demanded at a given
price level, such as increases in government purchas-
es or the money supply, shift the AD curve up and to
the right.
10. The aggregate supply curve relates the quantity of
output supplied to the price level. In the short run,
the price level is fixed and firms supply whatever
level of output is demanded, so the short-run
aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is horizontal. In the
long run, after prices and wages have fully adjust-
ed and all markets are in equilibrium, firms pro-
duce the profit-maximizing level of output. Hence,
in the long run, aggregate output, Y, equals its full-
employment level, . In the long run, firms supply
regardless of the price level, so the long-run
aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is a vertical line
at .
11. Classical macroeconomists argue that prices and
wages adjust rapidly in response to changes in
supply or demand. This argument implies that, fol-
lowing shocks or changes in policy, the economy
quickly reaches its general equilibrium, represent-
ed by the IS–LM–FE intersection or, equivalently,
by the intersection of the AD and LRAS curves. In
contrast, Keynesian macroeconomists argue that
prices and wages adjust slowly enough that the
economy can remain away from its general equilib-
rium (long-run equilibrium) for a prolonged
period of time. Keynesians agree with classicals,
however, that eventually prices and wages fully
adjust so that the economy reaches its general
equilibrium.
12. Classicals and Keynesians agree that money is neutral
in the long run, after the economy has reached its gen-
eral equilibrium. Because classicals believe that long-
run equilibrium is reached quickly, they dismiss the
short-run equilibrium in which money is not neutral
as essentially irrelevant. Keynesians, who believe that
it may take several years for the economy to reach
general equilibrium, ascribe much more importance
to the short-run period in which money is not neutral.

The IS–LM model
The IS–LM model shows
general equilibrium in
the goods, asset, and
labor markets. It can be
used to analyze the
effects of economic
shocks on output, the
real interest rate, the
price level, and other
macroeconomic vari-
ables.
Diagram Elements
■ The real interest rate, r, is on the vertical axis, and
output, Y, is on the horizontal axis.
■ The full-employment line, FE, is vertical at full-
employment output. Full-employment output, , is
the level of output that ﬁrms supply when wages and
prices have fully adjusted, so employment is at its
full-employment level, . Full-employment output is
determined by the equation .
■ For any level of output, Y, the IS curve gives the real
interest rate, r, that clears the goods market—or, in
other words, the rate that equalizes desired national
saving, S
d
, and desired investment, I
d
. Because higher
output raises desired saving and lowers the real inter-
est rate that clears the goods market, the IS curve
slopes downward. Equivalently, the IS curve gives
combinations of output, Y, and the real interest rate, r,
that equalize the aggregate quantities of goods sup-
plied and demanded, Y = C
d
+ I
d
+ G.
■ For given values of the price level and output, the LM
curve gives the real interest rate that clears the asset
market, making the real money supply, M/P, and the
real quantity of money demanded, L(Y, r + π
e
), equal.
Because an increase in income raises real money
demand, which raises the real interest rate that clears
the asset market, the LM curve slopes upward.
Y = AF(K, N)

Y
Factors That Shift the Curves
■ Any factor that raises full-employment output shifts
the FE line to the right. See Summary table 11, p. 312.
■ For constant output, any change that reduces desired
national saving relative to desired investment increases
the real interest rate that clears the goods market and
shifts the IS curve up and to the right. Equivalently , any
change that increases the aggregate demand for goods
at a speciﬁc level of income raises the real interest rate
that clears the goods market and shifts the IS curve up
and to the right. See Summary table 12, p. 315.
■ For constant output, any change that reduces real
money supply relative to real money demand increas-
es the real interest rate that clears the asset market
and shifts the LM curve up and to the left. See Sum-
mary table 13, p. 321.
Analysis
■ If we assume that the LM curve is LM
1
, the economy
is in general equilibrium at point E, which lies on all
three curves. At E the labor market (FE line), the
goods market (IS curve), and the asset market (LM
curve) are all in equilibrium. At E output equals full-
employment output, ; and the real interest rate, r
1
,
clears both the goods and asset markets.

The aggregate
demand–aggregate
supply model
The AD–AS model
shows the determination
of the price level and
output. In the short run,
before prices adjust,
equilibrium occurs at the
intersection of the AD
and SRAS curves. In the
long run, equilibrium
occurs at the intersection
of the AD and LRAS
curves.
■ If we assume that the LM curve is LM
2
, the FE line
and IS and LM curves don’t all intersect, and the
economy is out of general equilibrium. We assume
that, when the economy is out of general equilibri-
um, the short-run equilibrium of the economy occurs
at the intersection of the IS and LM curves (point F),
where the goods and asset markets are in equilibrium
but the labor market isn’t. If we assume that (at least
temporarily) ﬁrms produce enough output to meet
the increased aggregate demand at F, in short-run
equilibrium the economy’s output is Y
2
.
■ At the short-run equilibrium point, F, output, Y
2
, is
greater than ﬁrms’ proﬁt-maximizing level of output,
. Because aggregate demand at F exceeds what ﬁrms
want to produce, they raise prices. An increase in the
price level, P, lowers the real money supply, M/P, and
Y
shifts the LM curve up and to the left, to LM
1
, and
general equilibrium is reached at E. At E output again
equals full-employment output, . Similarly, if the
short-run equilibrium had been to the left of the FE
line, declines in the price level, P, would have shifted
the LM curve down and to the right and restored gen-
eral equilibrium at E.
■ According to classical economists, the price adjust-
ment process quickly restores the economy to gener-
al equilibrium at point E, so the economy spends little
or no time at point F, away from full employment.
Keynesians argue that prices and wages are slow to
adjust, so the economy may remain at the short-run
equilibrium point, F, with output different from , for
an extended period of time.

Diagram Elements
■ The price level, P, is on the vertical axis, and the level
of output, Y, is on the horizontal axis.
■ The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the aggregate
quantity of output demanded at each price level.
The aggregate amount of output demanded is deter-
mined by the intersection of the IS and LM curves (see
Fig. 9.10, p. 338). An increase in the price level, P, reduces
the real money supply, shifting the LM curve up and to
the left, and reduces the aggregate quantity of output
demanded. Thus the AD curve slopes downward.
■ The aggregate supply curves show the relationship
between the price level and the aggregate quantity of
output supplied in the short run and in the long run.
In the short run, the price level is ﬁxed, and ﬁrms
supply whatever level of output is demanded. Thus
the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is hori-
zontal. In the long run, ﬁrms produce the amount of
output that maximizes their proﬁts, which is the full-
employment level of output, . Because aggregate
output in the long run equals regardless of the price
level, P, the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve
is a vertical line at . Y = Y

Chapter 9 The IS–LM/AD–AS Model 347
Factors That Shift the Curves
■ The aggregate quantity of output demanded is deter-
mined by the intersection of the IS and the LM curves.
At a constant price level, any factor that shifts the
IS–LM intersection to the right increases the aggre-
gate quantity of goods demanded and thus also shifts
the AD curve up and to the right. Factors that shift the
AD curve are listed in Summary table 14, p. 340.
■ Any factor, such as an increase in the costs of produc-
tion, that leads ﬁrms to increase prices in the short-run
will shift the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve
up. Any factor that increases the full-employment level
of output, , shifts the long-run aggregate supply
(LRAS) curve to the right. Factors that increase are
listed in Summary table 11, p. 312. 
Analysis
■ The economy’s short-run equilibrium is represented
by the intersection of the AD and SRAS curves, as at
Y
Y
point E. The long-run equilibrium of the economy is
represented by the intersection of the AD curve and
LRAS curve, also at point E. In the long run, output
equals its full-employment level, .
■ The short-run equilibrium can temporarily differ
from the long-run equilibrium as a result of shocks
or policy changes that affect the economy. For
instance, an increase in the nominal money supply
shifts the aggregate demand curve up and to the
right from AD
1
to AD
2
. The new short-run equilibri-
um is represented by point F, where output is higher
than its full-employment level, . At point F, ﬁrms
produce an amount of output that is greater than the
proﬁt-maximizing level, and they begin to increase
prices. In the new long-run equilibrium at point H,
output is at its full-employment level and the price
level is higher than its initial value, P
1
. Because the
new price level is P
2
, the short-run aggregate supply
curve shifts up to SRAS
2
, which is a horizontal line
at P = P

ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. Use the IS–LM model to determine the effects of each
of the following on the general equilibrium values of
the real wage, employment, output, real interest rate,
consumption, investment, and price level.
a. A reduction in the effective tax rate on capital
increases desired investment.
b. The expected rate of inﬂation rises.
c. An influx of working-age immigrants increases
labor supply (ignore any other possible effects of
increased population).
d. Increased usage of automatic teller machines
reduces the demand for money.
2. Use the IS–LM model to analyze the general equilibri-
um effects of a permanent increase in the price of oil (a
permanent adverse supply shock) on current output,
employment, the real wage, national saving, con-
sumption, investment, the real interest rate, and the
price level. Assume that, besides reducing the current
productivity of capital and labor, the permanent
supply shock lowers both the expected future MPK
and households’ expected future incomes. (Assume
that the rightward shift in labor supply is smaller than
the leftward shift in labor demand.) Show that, if the
real interest rate rises at all, it will rise less than in the
case of a temporary supply shock that has an equal
effect on current output.
3. Suppose that the price level is ﬁxed in the short run so
that the economy doesn’t reach general equilibrium
immediately after a change in the economy. For each of
the following changes, what are the short-run effects on
the real interest rate and output? Assume that, when the
economy is in disequilibrium, only the labor market is
out of equilibrium; assume also that for a short period
ﬁrms are willing to produce enough output to meet the
aggregate demand for output.
a. A decrease in the expected rate of inﬂation.
b. An increase in consumer optimism that increases
desired consumption at each level of income and
the real interest rate.
c. A temporary increase in government purchases.
d. An increase in lump-sum taxes, with no change in
government purchases (consider both the case in
M09_ABEL4529_07_SE_C09.QXD  12/10/09  12:39 AM  Page 349

which Ricardian equivalence holds and the case in
which it doesn’t).
e. A scientiﬁc breakthrough that increases the expect-
ed future MPK.
4. (Appendix 9.B) In some macroeconomic models,
desired investment depends on both the current level
of output and the real interest rate. One possible
reason that desired investment may depend on output
is that, when current production and sales are high,
ﬁrms may expect continued strong demand for their
products in the future, which leads them to want to
expand capacity.
Algebraically, we can allow for a link between
desired investment and current output by replacing Eq.

5. (Appendix 9.B) Recall from Chapter 7 that an increase in

demand for money. To capture that effect, let’s replace

Worked-Out Numerical Exercise 
for Solving the IS–LM/AD–AS Model
To help you work through the algebra needed for numerical problems in this chapter,
here is a worked-out numerical exercise as an example for solving the IS–LM model:
Consider an economy that is described by the following equations:
In the short run, the price level is ﬁxed at P
sr
. Find the short-run and long-run
equilibrium values of Y, P , r, C, I, and i.
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
Step 1: Find the equation for the IS curve by using the goods market equilibri-
um condition, Y= C
d
+ I
d
+ G. Substitute the equation for T into the equation for C
d
from above. Then substitute the resulting equation and the equation for I
d
from
above, along with the value of G, into Y = C
d
+ I
d
+ G to obtain: Y = {300 + 0.75[Y -
(100 + 0.2Y)] - 300r} + [200 - 200r] + 600. Rearrange this equation as an equation for
r in terms of Y: Y = [300 + 0.75Y - 75 - 0.15Y - 300r] + [200 - 200r] + 600, so 0.4Y =
[300 - 75 + 200 + 600] - (300 + 200)r, so 500r= 1025 - 0.4Y. Therefore, r = 1025/500 -
(0.4/500)Y, so r = 2.05 - 0.0008Y. This is the IS curve.
Step 2: Find the equation for the LM curve by using the asset market equilib-
rium condition.
a. First, find the equation for the LM curve with an unspecified value of the
price level. The asset market equilibrium condition equates real money supply
to real money demand. Real money demand is given by L = 0.5Y - 500i = 0.5Y -
500 (r + π
e
) = 0.5Y - 500(r + 0.05), and real money supply is M/P = 133,200/P. In
asset market equilibrium, 133,200/P = 0.5Y - 500(r + 0.05), so 500r = 0.5Y - 25 –
133,200/P. Therefore, r = (0.5/500)Y - (25/500) - (133,200/500)/P = 0.001Y - 0.05
- 266.4/P. This is the equation of the LM curve for an unspecified value of P.
b. Then ﬁnd the equation for the LM curve when P= P
sr
. Set P= P
sr
= 120 in the
LM curve to obtain r = 0.001Y - 0.05 - 266.4/120, so r = 0.001Y - 0.05 - 2.22. There-
fore, r = 0.001Y - 2.27. This is the equation of the LM curve when P = P
sr
.
Step 3: Find the short-run equilibrium.
a. Find the intersection of the IS and LM curves to ﬁnd the short-run equilibrium
values of Y and r. We have written the equations of the IS and LM curves so that the
left side of each equation is simply r. Setting the right side of the IS curve equal to the
right side of the LM curve yields 2.05 - 0.0008Y = 0.001Y - 2.27, so 4.32 = 0.0018Y.
Therefore, Y = 4.32/0.0018 = 2400. Now use the value of Y in either the IS or the LM
Y = 2500; G = 600; M = 133,200; p

= 0.05; P

= 120.

curve. In the IS curve, r= 2.05 - 0.0008Y= 2.05 - (0.0008 × 2400) = 2.05 - 1.92 = 0.13. In
the LM curve, r = 0.001Y - 2.27 = (0.001 × 2400) - 2.27 = 2.40 - 2.27 = 0.13.
b. Plug these equilibrium values of Y and r into other equations to ﬁnd equilib-
rium values for T, C, I, and i.
Step 4: Find the long-run equilibrium.
a. Use the fact that in long-run equilibrium, . Plug the equilibrium level
of output into the IS equation to find the equilibrium real interest rate. Use
and the IS equation, r= 2.05 - 0.0008Y, to obtain r= 2.05 - (0.0008 × 2500) =
2.05 - 2.00 = 0.05.
b. Plug the equilibrium values of Y and r into other equations to ﬁnd equilib-
rium values for T, C, I, and i.
c. Plug the equilibrium values of Y and i into the money demand equation to
obtain the value of real money demand L. Then ﬁnd the value of P that equates real
money supply, M/P, with real money demand, L. The money demand curve is L =
0.5Y- 500i= (0.5 × 2500) - (500 × 0.10) = 1250 - 50 = 1200. Setting real money supply
equal to real money demand gives 133,200/P = 1200, so P = 133,200/1200 = 111.
Step 5: Find the equation for the AD curve by using the IS and LM curves. Use
the form of the LM curve for an unspeciﬁed value of P.
The IS and LM curves are both written so that r appears alone on the left side,
so the right sides of both can be equated to obtain:
Dividing this equation through by 0.0018 yields Y = 2.10/0.0018 + (266.4/
0.0018)/P, so Y = 1166 + 148,000/P. This is the AD curve.
Step 6: Illustrate the use of the AD curve and short-run and long-run aggregate
supply curves. In the short run, the SRAS curve is P = P
sr
= 120, which means it is
a horizontal line. The short-run equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the AD and
SRAS curves. Plug P = 120 into the AD curve to obtain Y = 1166 + 148,000/120 =
1166 +1233 . Therefore Y = 2400, the same result we found in Step 3.
In the long run, output equals its full-employment level, so the LRAS curve is
which means it is a vertical line. The long-run equilibrium occurs at
the intersection of the AD and LRAS curves. Plug into the AD curve
to obtain 2500 = Y = 1166 + 148,000/P, so 1333 = 148,000/P, which implies P =
148,000/1333 = 111, the same result we found in Step 4.

= 300 + 1365 - 39 = 1626.
C = 300 + 0.75(Y -T) - 300r = 300 + [0.75(2400 - 580)] - (300 * 0.13)
T = 100 + 0.2Y = 100 + (0.2 * 2400), so T = 580.

Algebraic Versions of the 
IS–LM and AD–AS Models
In this appendix we present algebraic versions of the IS–LM and AD–AS models.
For each of the three markets—labor, goods, and assets—we ﬁrst present equations
that describe demand and supply in that market, then ﬁnd the market equilibrium.
After considering each market separately, we solve for the general equilibrium of
the complete IS–LM model. We use the IS–LM model to derive the aggregate
demand (AD) curve and then introduce the short-run and long-run aggregate
supply curves to derive the short-run and long-run equilibria.
The Labor Market
The demand for labor is based on the marginal product of labor, as determined by
the production function. Recall from Chapter 3 (Eq. 3.1) that the production func-
tion can be written as Y = AF(K, N), where Y is output, K is the capital stock, N is
labor input, and A is productivity. Holding the capital stock K ﬁxed, we can write
the production function with output Y as a function only of labor input N and pro-
ductivity A. A useful speciﬁc production function is
(9.B.1)
where f
1
and f
2
are positive numbers.
The marginal product of labor, MPN, is the slope of the production function.
The slope of the production function in Eq. (9.B.1) at any level of employment N
equals
10
A( f
1
- f
2
N), so the marginal product of labor is
(9.B.2)
Firms hire labor to the point at which the marginal product of labor equals the
real wage. Thus the relation between the real wage, w, and the amount of labor
demanded, ND, is
(9.B.3)
The supply of labor is an increasing function of the current, after-tax real wage.
If t is the tax rate on wage income (we assume that 0 ≤ t < 1) so that (1 - t)w is the
after-tax real wage, a simple form of the labor supply curve is

where NS is the amount of labor supplied, and n
w
is a positive number. Factors
other than the after-tax real wage that affect labor supply, such as wealth or the
working-age population, are captured by the constant term n
0
in Eq. (9.B.4).
Equilibrium in the Labor Market
In equilibrium, the amounts of labor demanded, ND, and supplied, NS, are equal;
their common value is the full-employment level of employment, . If we substi-
tute for NS and ND in Eqs. (9.B.3) and (9.B.4), we have two linear equations in
the two variables and w. Solving these equations for wand yields
11
(9.B.5)
and
(9.B.6)
Using the full-employment level of employment, , in Eq. (9.B.6), we obtain
the full-employment level of output, , by substituting into the production func-
tion (9.B.1):
(9.B.7)
The value of full-employment output in Eq. (9.B.7) is the horizontal intercept of the
FE line.
We use these equations to analyze the effects on the labor market of changes
in productivity and labor supply. First consider an increase in productivity A.
Equation (9.B.5) shows that an increase in A leads to an increase in the equilibrium
real wage (an increase in A raises the ratio A/[1 + (1 - t)Af
2
n
w
]). Although not
directly evident from Eq. (9.B.6), an increase in A also increases .
12
To see why,
note ﬁrst that an increase in A doesn’t affect the labor supply curve, Eq. (9.B.4).
Second, an increase in A raises the real wage. Hence the implication is that an
increase in A raises the equilibrium amount of labor supplied and thus also the
full-employment level of employment, . Because an increase in Araises , it
must also raise full-employment output, (see Eq. 9.B.7), and shift the FE line to
the right.
Now consider an increase in the amount of labor supplied at each level of the
after-tax real wage, represented algebraically as an increase in n
0
in Eq. (9.B.4).
Equations (9.B.5) and (9.B.6) show that an increase in n
0
reduces the equilibrium
real wage and increases employment, . Because an increase in labor supply
raises , it also raises full-employment output, , and shifts the FE line to the
right.

Chapter 9 The IS–LM/AD–AS Model 355
The Goods Market
To ﬁnd equilibrium in the goods market, we start with equations describing desired
consumption and desired investment. Desired consumption is
(9.B.8)
where Y- T is disposable income (income Y minus taxes T), r is the real interest rate,
and c
0
, c
Y
, and c
r
are positive numbers. The number c
Y
in Eq. (9.B.8) is the marginal
propensity to consume, as deﬁned in Chapter 4; because people consume only part
of an increase in disposable income, saving the rest, a reasonable assumption is
that 0 < c
Y
< 1. According to Eq. (9.B.8), an increase in disposable income causes
desired consumption to increase, and an increase in the real interest rate
causes desired consumption to fall (and desired saving to rise). Other factors that
affect desired consumption, such as wealth or expected future income, are included
in the constant term c
0
.
13
Taxes in Eq. (9.B.8) are
(9.B.9)
where t is the tax rate on income (the same tax rate that is levied on wages) and t
0
is a lump-sum tax. As mentioned earlier, 0   t  1, so an increase in income, Y,
increases total taxes, T, and also increases disposable income, Y - T.
Desired investment is
(9.B.10)
where i
0
and i
r
are positive numbers. Equation (9.B.10) indicates that desired invest-
ment falls when the real interest rate rises. Other factors affecting desired invest-
ment, such as the expected future marginal product of capital, are included in the
constant term i
0
.
Equilibrium in the Goods Market
The goods market equilibrium condition in a closed economy is given by Eq. (4.7),
which we repeat here:
(9.B.11)
Equation (9.B.11) is equivalent to the goods market equilibrium condition, S
d
= I
d
,
which could be used equally well here.
If we substitute the equations for desired consumption (Eq. 9.B.8, with taxes T
as given by Eq. 9.B.9) and desired investment (Eq. 9.B.10) into the goods market
equilibrium condition (Eq. 9.B.11), we get

Because an increase in taxes, T, reduces desired consumption in Eq. (9.B.8), this formulation of
desired consumption appears, at ﬁrst glance, to be inconsistent with the Ricardian equivalence propo-
sition discussed in Chapter 4. However, essential to the idea of Ricardian equivalence is that con-
sumers expect an increase in current taxes, T, to be accompanied by lower taxes in the future. This
decrease in expected future taxes would increase desired consumption, which would be captured in
Eq. (9.B.8) as an increase in c
0
. According to the Ricardian equivalence proposition, after an increase
in T with no change in current or planned government purchases, an increase in c
0
would exactly
offset the reduction in c
Y
(Y - T) so that desired consumption would be unchanged.

Collecting the terms that multiply Y on the left side yields
(9.B.13)
Equation (9.B.13) relates output, Y, to the real interest rate, r, that clears the
goods market. This relationship between Y and r defines the IS curve. Because
the IS curve is graphed with r on the vertical axis and Y on the horizontal axis,
we rewrite Eq. (9.B.13) with r on the left side and Y on the right side. Solving 
Eq. (9.B.13) for r gives
(9.B.14)
In Eq. (9.B.14), are positive numbers deﬁned as
(9.B.15)
and
(9.B.16)
Equation (9.B.14) yields the graph of the IS curve. In Eq. (9.B.14), the coefﬁ-
cient of Y, or , is the slope of the IS curve; because this slope is negative, the
IS curve slopes downward. Changes in the constant term in Eq. (9.B.14), which
is deﬁned in Eq. (9.B.15), shift the IS curve. Anything that increases —such as
(1) an increase in consumer optimism that increases desired consumption by
increasing c
0
; (2) an increase in the expected future marginal product of capital,
MPK
f
, that raises desired investment by raising i
0
; or (3) an increase in government
purchases, G—shifts the IS curve up and to the right. Similarly, anything that
decreases shifts the IS curve down and to the left.
The Asset Market
In general, the real demand for money depends on real income, Y, and the nominal
interest rate on nonmonetary assets, i, which in turn equals the expected real inter-
est rate, r, plus the expected rate of inﬂation, π
e
. We assume that the money demand
function takes the form
(9.B.17)
where M
d
is the nominal demand for money, P is the price level, and 
Y
and 
r
are positive numbers. The constant term 
0
includes factors other than
output and the interest rate that affect money demand, such as the liquidity of
alternative assets. The real supply of money equals the nominal supply of
money, M, which is determined by the central bank, divided by the price
level, P.
Equilibrium in the Asset Market
As we showed in Chapter 7, if we assume that there are only two types of assets
(money and nonmonetary assets), the asset market is in equilibrium when the real
quantity of money demanded equals the real money supply, M/P. Using the

money demand function in Eq. (9.B.17), we write the asset market equilibrium
condition as
(9.B.18)
For ﬁxed levels of the nominal money supply, M, price level, P, and expected rate
of inﬂation, π
e
, Eq. (9.B.18) relates output, Y, and the real interest rate, r, that clears
the asset market. Thus Eq. (9.B.18) deﬁnes the LM curve. To get Eq. (9.B.18) into a
form that is easier to interpret graphically, we rewrite the equation with r alone on
the left side:
(9.B.19)
where
(9.B.20)
and
(9.B.21)
The graph of Eq. (9.B.19) is the LM curve. In Eq. (9.B.19), the coefﬁcient of Y, or β
LM
, is
the slope of the LM curve; because this coefﬁcient is positive, the LM curve slopes
upward. Variables that change the intercept of the equation in Eq. (9.B.19), α
LM
- (1/
r
)
(M/P), shift the LM curve. An increase in the real money supply , M/P, reduces this inter-
cept and thus shifts the LM curve down and to the right. An increase in the expected
rate of inﬂation π
e
reduces α
LM
and shifts the LM curve down and to the right. An
increase in real money demand arising from (for example) reduced liquidity of alterna-
tive assets raises 
0
, which raises α
LM
and shifts the LM curve up and to the left.
General Equilibrium in the IS–LM Model
From the supply and demand relationships and equilibrium conditions in each
market, we can calculate the general equilibrium values for the most important
macroeconomic variables. We have already solved for the general equilibrium
levels of the real wage, employment, and output in the labor market: The real
wage is given by Eq. (9.B.5); employment equals its full-employment level, ,
given by Eq. (9.B.6); and, in general equilibrium, output equals its full-employment
level, , as given by Eq. (9.B.7).
Turning to the goods market, we obtain the general equilibrium real interest
rate by substituting for Y in Eq. (9.B.14):
(9.B.22)
Having output, Y, and the real interest rate, r (determined by Eq. 9.B.22), we use
Eqs. (9.B.9), (9.B.8), and (9.B.10) to ﬁnd the general equilibrium values of taxes, T,
consumption, C, and investment, I, respectively.
The ﬁnal important macroeconomic variable whose equilibrium value needs
to be determined is the price level, P. To ﬁnd the equilibrium price level, we work

with the asset market equilibrium condition, Eq. (9.B.18). In Eq. (9.B.18), we sub-
stitute full-employment output, , for Y and use Eq. (9.B.22) to substitute the
equilibrium value of the real interest rate for r. Solving Eq. (9.B.18) for the price
level gives
(9.B.23)
Equation (9.B.23) conﬁrms that the equilibrium price level, P, is proportional to the
nominal money supply, M.
We can use these equations to analyze the effects of an adverse productiv-
ity shock on the general equilibrium, as in the text. We have already shown
that an increase in the productivity parameter, A, increases the equilibrium real
wage, the full-employment level of employment, and the full-employment
level of output. Thus an adverse productivity shock (a reduction in A) reduces
the general equilibrium levels of the real wage, employment, and output.
Equation (9.B.22) indicates that an adverse productivity shock, because it
reduces , must increase the equilibrium real interest rate. Lower output and
a higher real interest rate imply that both consumption and investment must
decline (Eqs. 9.B.8 and 9.B.10). Finally, the decrease in resulting from an
adverse productivity shock reduces the denominator of the right side of Eq.
(9.B.23), so the price level, P, must rise. All these results are the same as those
found by graphical analysis.
The AD–AS Model
Building on the algebraic version of the IS–LM model just derived, we now derive
an algebraic version of the AD–AS model presented in this chapter. We present
algebraic versions of the aggregate demand (AD) curve, the short-run aggregate
supply (SRAS) curve, and the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve and then
solve for short-run and long-run equilibria.
The Aggregate Demand Curve
Aggregate output demanded at any price level, P, is the amount of output corre-
sponding to the intersection of the IS and LM curves. We ﬁnd the value of Y at the
intersection of the IS and LM curves by setting the right sides of Eqs. (9.B.14) and
(9.B.19) equal and solving for Y:
(9.B.24)
Equation (9.B.24) is the aggregate demand curve. For constant nominal money
supply, M, Eq. (9.B.24) shows that the aggregate quantity of goods demanded, Y, is
a decreasing function of the price level, P, so that the AD curve slopes downward.
Note that the numerator of the right side of Eq. (9.B.24) is the intercept of the IS
curve minus the intercept of the LM curve. Thus, for a constant price level, any
change that shifts the IS curve up and to the right (such as an increase in the gov-
ernment purchases) or shifts the LM curve down and to the right (such as an
increase in the nominal money supply) increases aggregate output demanded and
shifts the AD curve up and to the right.

The Aggregate Supply Curve
In the short run, ﬁrms supply the output demanded at the ﬁxed price level, which
we denote P
sr
. Thus the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is a horizontal
line:
(9.B.25)
The long-run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line at the full-employment
level of output, , or
(9.B.26)
Short-Run and Long-Run Equilibrium
The short-run equilibrium of the economy is represented by the intersection of
the aggregate demand (AD) curve and the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)
curve. We ﬁnd the quantity of output in short-run equilibrium simply by substi-
tuting the equation of the SRAS curve (Eq. 9.B.25) into the equation of the AD
curve (Eq. 9.B.24) to obtain
(9.B.27)
The long-run equilibrium of the economy, which is reached when the labor,
goods, and asset markets are all in equilibrium, is represented by the intersection
of the aggregate demand curve and the long-run aggregate supply curve. Thus
in long-run equilibrium, from the LRAS curve in Eq. (9.B.26). We ﬁnd the
price level in long-run equilibrium by setting the right sides of the equation of the
AD curve (Eq. 9.B.24) and the equation of the LRAS curve (Eq. 9.B.26) equal and
solving for P to obtain
(9.B.28)
The long-run equilibrium price level in Eq. (9.B.28) is the same as that at the
IS–LM–FE intersection in Eq. (9.B.23). You can verify that the price level is the same
in both equations by substituting the deﬁnitions of α
LM
and β

from Eqs. (9.B.20)
and (9.B.21), respectively, into Eq. (9.B.28).

CHAPTER 10
Classical Business Cycle
Analysis: Market-Clearing
Macroeconomics
Economists generally agree about the basic business cycle facts outlined in Chapter 8.
They know that economic growth isn’t necessarily smooth and that occasionally there
are periods of recession in which output declines and unemployment rises. They
know that recessions typically are followed by periods of recovery in which the econ-
omy grows more strongly than normal. And they also know a great deal about how
other macroeconomic variables—such as productivity, interest rates, and inﬂation—
behave during recessions.
Recall that recessions and booms in the economy raise two basic questions:
(1) What are the underlying economic causes of these business cycles? and
(2) What, if anything, should government policymakers do about them? Unfortu-
nately, economists agree less about the answers to these two questions than about
the basic business cycle facts.
The main disagreements about the causes and cures of recessions are between
two broad groups of macroeconomists, the classicals and the Keynesians. As dis-
cussed ﬁrst in Chapter 1 and again in Chapters 8 and 9, classicals and Keyne-
sians—although agreeing on many points—differ primarily in their views on how
rapidly prices and wages adjust to restore general equilibrium after an economic
shock. Classical macroeconomists assume that prices and wages adjust quickly to
equate quantities supplied and demanded in each market; as a result, they argue,
a market economy is largely “self-correcting,” with a strong tendency to return to
general equilibrium on its own when it is disturbed by an economic shock or a
change in public policy. Keynesians usually agree that prices and wages eventually
change as needed to clear markets; however, they believe that in the short run price
and wage adjustment is likely to be incomplete. That is, in the short run, quantities
supplied and demanded need not be equal and the economy may remain out of
general equilibrium. Although this difference in views may seem purely theoreti-
cal, it has a practical implication: Because Keynesians are skeptical about the econ-
omy’s ability to reach equilibrium rapidly on its own, they are much more inclined
than are classicals to recommend that government act to raise output and employ-
ment during recessions and to moderate economic growth during booms.
In this chapter and Chapter 11 we develop and compare the classical and
Keynesian theories of the business cycle and the policy recommendations of the
M10_ABEL4529_07_SE_C10.QXD  12/10/09  12:44 AM  Page 360
Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 361
two groups, beginning with the classical perspective in this chapter. Conveniently,
both the classical and Keynesian analyses can be expressed in terms of a common
analytical framework, the IS–LM/AD–AS model. In this chapter we use the classi-
cal (or market-clearing) version of the IS–LM/AD–AS model, composed of the
IS–LM/AD–AS model and the assumption that prices and wages adjust rapidly.
The assumption that prices and wages adjust rapidly implies that the economy
always is in or near general equilibrium and therefore that variables such as output
and employment always are close to their general equilibrium levels.
In comparing the principal competing theories of the business cycle, we are
particularly interested in how well the various theories explain the business cycle
facts. The classical theory is consistent with many of the most important facts
about the cycle. However, one business cycle fact that challenges the classical
theory is the observation that changes in the money stock lead the cycle. Recall the
implication of the classical assumption that wages and prices adjust quickly to
clear markets, so that the economy reaches long-run equilibrium quickly. Money is
neutral, which means that changes in the money supply do not affect output and
other real variables. However, most economists interpret the fact that money leads
the cycle as evidence that money is not neutral in all situations. If money isn’t
neutral, we must either modify the basic classical model to account for monetary
nonneutrality or abandon the classical model in favor of alternative theories (such
as the Keynesian approach) that are consistent with nonneutrality. In Section 10.3
we extend the classical model to allow for nonneutrality of money. We then exam-
ine the implications of this extended classical approach for macroeconomic policy.
10.1 Business Cycles in the Classical Model
We have identiﬁed two basic questions of business cycle analysis: What causes
business cycles? and What can (or should) be done about them? Let’s examine the
classical answers to these questions, beginning with what causes business cycles.
The Real Business Cycle Theory
Recall from Section 8.4 that a complete theory of the business cycle must have two
components. The first is a description of the types of shocks or disturbances
believed to affect the economy the most. Examples of economic disturbances
emphasized by various theories of the business cycle include supply shocks,
changes in monetary or ﬁscal policy, and changes in consumer spending. The
second component is a model that describes how key macroeconomic variables,
such as output, employment, and prices, respond to economic shocks. Classical
economists prefer to build their models from microeconomic foundations, describ-
ing how people maximize their utility and how ﬁrms maximize proﬁts. Thus their
preferred models are quite complex and we cannot represent them easily in this
textbook. However, the main results of their detailed models are similar to those
from the market-clearing version of the IS–LM model, so in this textbook we will
use that model to represent the views of classical macroeconomists. In addition, the
issue of which shocks are crucial in driving cyclical ﬂuctuations remains.

developed a theory that takes a strong stand on the sources of shocks that cause
cyclical ﬂuctuations. This theory, the real business cycle theory (or RBC theory),
argues that real shocks to the economy are the primary cause of business cycles.
1
Real shocks are disturbances to the “real side” of the economy, such as shocks that
affect the production function, the size of the labor force, the real quantity of gov-
ernment purchases, and the spending and saving decisions of consumers. Econo-
mists contrast real shocks with nominal shocks, or shocks to money supply or
money demand. In terms of the IS–LM model, real shocks directly affect the IS
curve or the FE line, whereas nominal shocks directly affect only the LM curve.
Although many types of real shocks could contribute to the business cycle,
RBC economists give the largest role to production function shocks—what we’ve
called supply shocks and what the RBC economists usually refer to as productivity
shocks. Productivity shocks include the development of new products or produc-
tion methods, the introduction of new management techniques, changes in the
quality of capital or labor, changes in the availability of raw materials or energy,
unusually good or unusually bad weather, changes in government regulations
affecting production, and any other factor affecting productivity. According to RBC
economists, most economic booms result from beneﬁcial productivity shocks, and
most recessions are caused by adverse productivity shocks.
The Recessionary Impact of an Adverse Productivity Shock. Does the RBC
economists’ idea that adverse productivity shocks lead to recessions (and,
similarly, that beneﬁcial productivity shocks lead to booms) make sense? We
examined the theoretical effects on the economy of a temporary adverse
productivity shock in Chapters 3, 8, and 9.
2
In Chapter 3 we showed that an
adverse productivity shock (or supply shock), such as an increase in the price of
oil, reduces the marginal product of labor (MPN) and the demand for labor at any
real wage. As a result, the equilibrium values of the real wage and employment
both fall (see Fig. 3.11). The equilibrium level of output (the full-employment level
of output ) also falls, both because equilibrium employment declines and
because the adverse productivity shock reduces the amount of output that can be
produced by any amount of capital and labor.
We later used the complete IS–LM model (Fig. 9.8) to explore the general equi-
librium effects of a temporary adverse productivity shock. We conﬁrmed our ear-
lier conclusion that an adverse productivity shock lowers the general equilibrium
levels of the real wage, employment, and output. In addition, we showed that an
adverse productivity shock raises the real interest rate, depresses consumption
and investment, and raises the price level.
Broadly , then, our earlier analyses of the effects of an adverse productivity shock
support the RBC economists’ claim that such shocks are recessionary, in that they
lead to declines in output. Similar analyses show that a beneﬁcial productivity shock
leads to a rise in output (a boom). Note that, in the RBC approach, output declines in

RBC economists analyze permanent as well as temporary productivity shocks; we focus on tempo-
rary shocks because it is the slightly easier case.

recessions and rises in booms because the general equilibrium (or full-employment)
level of output has changed and because rapid price adjustment ensures that actual
output always equals full-employment output. As classical economists, RBC econo-
mists would reject the Keynesian view (discussed in Chapter 11) that recessions and
booms are periods of disequilibrium, during which actual output is below or above
its general equilibrium level for a protracted period of time.
Real Business Cycle Theory and the Business Cycle Facts. Although the RBC
theory—which combines the classical, or market-clearing, version of the IS–LM
model with the assumption that productivity shocks are the dominant form of
economic disturbance—is relatively simple, it is consistent with many of the basic
business cycle facts. First, under the assumption that the economy is being
continuously buffeted by productivity shocks, the RBC approach predicts recurrent
ﬂuctuations in aggregate output, which actually occur. Second, the RBC theory
correctly predicts that employment will move procyclically—that is, in the same
direction as output. Third, the RBC theory predicts that real wages will be higher
during booms than during recessions (procyclical real wages), as also occurs.
A fourth business cycle fact explained by the RBC theory is that average labor
productivity is procyclical; that is, output per worker is higher during booms than
during recessions. This fact is consistent with the RBC economists’ assumption
that booms are periods of beneﬁcial productivity shocks, which tend to raise labor
productivity, whereas recessions are the results of adverse productivity shocks,
which tend to reduce labor productivity. The RBC economists point out that with-
out productivity shocks—allowing the production function to remain stable over
time—average labor productivity wouldn’t be procyclical. With no productivity
shocks, the expansion of employment that occurs during booms would tend to
reduce average labor productivity because of the principle of diminishing margin-
al productivity of labor. Similarly, without productivity shocks, recessions would be
periods of relatively higher labor productivity, instead of lower productivity as
observed. Thus RBC economists regard the procyclical nature of average labor
productivity as strong evidence supporting their approach.
A business cycle fact that does not seem to be consistent with the simple RBC
theory is that inﬂation tends to slow during or immediately after a recession. The
theory predicts that an adverse productivity shock will both cause a recession and
increase the general price level. Thus, according to the RBC approach, periods of
recession should also be periods of inﬂation, contrary to the business cycle fact.
Some RBC economists have responded by taking issue with the conventional
view that inﬂation is procyclical. For example, in a study of the period 1954–1989,
RBC proponents Kydland and Prescott
3
showed that the ﬁnding of procyclical inﬂa-
tion is somewhat sensitive to the statistical methods used to calculate the trends in
inﬂation and output. Using a different method of calculating these trends, Kydland
and Prescott found evidence that, when aggregate output has been above its long-
run trend, the price level has tended to be below its long-run trend, a result more
nearly consistent with the RBC prediction about the cyclical behavior of prices.
Kydland and Prescott suggested that standard views about the procyclicality of
prices and inﬂation are based mostly on the experience of the economy between the
two world wars (1918–1941), when the economy had a different structure and was

subject to different types of shocks than the more recent economy. For example,
many economists believe that the Great Depression—the most important macro-
economic event between the two world wars—resulted from a sequence of large,
adverse aggregate demand shocks. As we illustrated in Fig. 8.17, an adverse aggre-
gate demand shock shifts the AD curve down and to the left, leading ﬁrst to a
decline in output and then to a decline in prices; this pattern is consistent with the
conventional business cycle fact that inﬂation is procyclical and lagging. Kydland
and Prescott argue, however, that since World War II large adverse supply shocks
have caused the price level to rise while output fell. Most notably, inﬂation surged
during the recessions that followed the oil price shocks of 1973–1974 and 1979–1980.
The issue of the cyclical behavior of prices remains controversial, however.
APPLICATION
Calibrating the Business Cycle
If we put aside the debate about price level behavior, the RBC theory can account for
some of the business cycle facts, including the procyclical behavior of employment,
productivity , and real wages. However, real business cycle economists argue that an
adequate theory of the business cycle should be quantitative as well as qualitative. In
other words, in addition to predicting generally how key macroeconomic variables
move throughout the business cycle, the theory should predict numerically the size
of economic ﬂuctuations and the strength of relationships among the variables.
To examine the quantitative implications of their theories, RBC economists
developed a method called calibration. The idea is to work out a detailed numerical
example of a more general theory. The results are then compared to macroeco-
nomic data to see whether model and reality broadly agree.
The ﬁrst step in calibration is to write down a model of the economy—such as
the classical version of the IS–LM model—except that speciﬁc functions replace
general functions. For example, instead of representing the production function in
general terms as
the person doing the calibration uses a speciﬁc algebraic form for the production
function, such as
4
where a is a number between 0 and 1. Similarly, speciﬁc functions are used to
describe the behavior of consumers and workers.
Next, the speciﬁc functions chosen are made even more speciﬁc by expressing
them in numerical terms. For example, for a = 0.3, the production function becomes
In the same way, speciﬁc numbers are assigned to the functions describing the
behavior of consumers and workers. Where do these numbers come from? Gener-
ally , they are not estimated from macroeconomic data but are based on other sources.

This production function is the Cobb–Douglas production function (Chapter 3). As we noted,
although it is relatively simple, it ﬁts U.S. data quite well.
M10_ABEL4529_07_SE_C10.QXD  12/10/09  12:44 AM  Page 364
For example, the numbers assigned to the functions in the model may come
from previous studies of the production function or of the saving behavior of indi-
viduals and families.
The third step, which must be carried out on a computer, is to ﬁnd out how the
numerically speciﬁed model behaves when it is hit by random shocks, such as
productivity shocks. The shocks are created on the computer with a random
number generator, with the size and persistence of the shocks (unlike the numbers
assigned to the speciﬁc functions) being chosen to ﬁt the actual macroeconomic
data. For these shocks, the computer tracks the behavior of the model over many
periods and reports the implied behavior of key macroeconomic variables such as
output, employment, consumption, and investment. The results from these simu-
lations are then compared to the behavior of the actual economy to determine how
well the model ﬁts reality.
Edward Prescott

performed an early and inﬂuential calibration exercise. He
used a model similar to the RBC model we present here, the main difference being
that our version of the RBC model is essentially a two-period model (the present
and the future), and Prescott’s model allowed for many periods. The results of his
computer simulations are shown in Figs. 10.1 and 10.2.

variables, as calculated from post–World War II U.S. data, with the volatilities pre-
dicted by Prescott’s calibrated RBC model.

Prescott set the size of the random pro-
ductivity shocks in his simulations so that the volatility of GNP in his model would
match the actual volatility in U.S. GNP.
7
That choice explains why the actual and
simulated volatilities of GNP are equal in Fig. 10.1. But he did nothing to guaran-
tee that the simulation would match the actual volatilities of the other ﬁve vari-
ables. Note, however, that the simulated and actual volatilities for the other
variables in most cases are quite close.
Figure 10.2 compares the actual economy with Prescott’s calibrated model in
another respect: how closely important macroeconomic variables move with GNP
over the business cycle. The statistical measure of how closely variables move
together is called correlation. If a variable’s correlation with GNP is positive, the
variable tends to move in the same direction as GNP over the business cycle (that
is, the variable is procyclical). A correlation with GNP of 1.0 indicates that the vari-
able’s movements track the movements of GNP perfectly (thus the correlation of
GNP with itself is 1.0), and a correlation with GNP of 0 indicates no relationship to

Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 367
Are Productivity Shocks the Only Source of Recessions? Although RBC
economists agree in principle that many types of real shocks buffet the
economy, in practice much of their work rests on the assumption that
productivity shocks are the dominant, or even the only, source of recessions.
Many economists, including both classicals and Keynesians, have criticized
this assumption as being unrealistic. For example, some economists challenged
the RBC economists to identify the specific productivity shocks that they
believe caused each of the recessions since World War II. The critics argue that,
except for the oil price shocks of 1973, 1979, and 1990, and the tech revolution
of the late 1990s, historical examples of economywide productivity shocks are
virtually nonexistent.
An interesting RBC response to that argument is that, in principle, economy-
wide ﬂuctuations could also be caused by the cumulative effects of a series of
small productivity shocks. To illustrate the point that small shocks can cause large
ﬂuctuations, Fig. 10.3 shows the results of a computer simulation of productivity
shocks and the associated behavior of output for a simpliﬁed RBC model. In this
simple RBC model, the change in output from one month to the next has two
parts: (1) a ﬁxed part that arises from normal technical progress or from a normal
increase in population and employment; and (2) an unpredictable part that reﬂects
a random shock to productivity during the current month.
8
The random, com-
puter-generated productivity shocks are shown at the bottom of Fig. 10.3, and the
implied behavior of output is displayed above them. Although none of the indi-
vidual shocks is large, the cumulative effect of the shocks causes large ﬂuctuations
in output that look something like business cycles. Hence business cycles may be
the result of productivity shocks, even though identifying speciﬁc, large shocks is
difﬁcult.
Does the Solow Residual Measure Technology Shocks? Because productivity
shocks are the primary source of business cycle ﬂuctuations in RBC models, RBC
economists have attempted to measure the size of these shocks. The most
common measure of productivity shocks is known as the Solow residual, which
GNP. Correlations with GNP between 0 and 1.0 reﬂect relationships with GNP of
intermediate strength. Figure 10.2 shows that Prescott’s model generally accounts
well for the strength of the relationships between some of the variables and GNP,
although the correlation of productivity and GNP predicted by Prescott’s model is
noticeably larger than the actual correlation.
The degree to which relatively simple calibrated RBC models can match the
actual data is impressive. In addition, the results of calibration exercises help guide
further development of the model. For example, the version of the RBC model
discussed here has been modiﬁed to improve the match between the actual and
predicted correlations of productivity with GNP .

SIMULATED PRODUCTIVITY SHOCKS
is an empirical measure of total factor productivity, A. The Solow residual is
named after the originator of modern growth theory, Robert Solow,
9
who used
this measure in the 1950s.
Recall from Chapter 3 that, to measure total factor productivity A, we need
data on output, Y, and the inputs of capital, K, and labor, N. In addition, we need
to use a speciﬁc algebraic form for the production function. Then we have,
(10.1)
The Solow residual is called a “residual” because it is the part of output that cannot
be directly explained by measured capital and labor inputs.
When the Solow residual is computed from actual U.S. data, using Eq. (10.1), it
turns out to be strongly procyclical, rising in economic expansions and falling in
recessions. This procyclical behavior is consistent with the premise of RBC theory
that cyclical ﬂuctuations in aggregate output are driven largely by productivity
shocks.
However, some economists have questioned whether the Solow residual
should be interpreted solely as a measure of technology, as early RBC proponents
tended to do. If changes in the Solow residual reﬂect only changes in the technolo-
gies available to an economy, its value should be unrelated to factors such as gov-
ernment purchases or monetary policy that don’t directly affect scientific and
technological progress (at least in the short run). However, statistical studies reveal

that the Solow residual is in fact correlated with factors such as government expen-
ditures, suggesting that movements in the Solow residual may also reﬂect the
impacts of other factors.
10
To understand why measured productivity can vary, even if the actual tech-
nology used in production doesn’t change, we need to recognize that capital and
labor sometimes are used more intensively than at other times and that more inten-
sive use of inputs leads to higher output. For instance, a printing press used full-
time contributes more to production than an otherwise identical printing press
used half-time. Similarly, workers working rapidly (for example, restaurant work-
ers during a busy lunch hour) will produce more output and revenue than the
same number of workers working more slowly (the same restaurant workers
during the afternoon lull). To capture the idea that capital and labor resources can
be used more or less intensively at different times, we deﬁne the utilization rate of
capital, , and the utilization rate of labor, u
N
. The utilization rate of a factor mea-
sures the intensity at which it is being used. For example, the utilization rate of cap-
ital for the printing press run full-time would be twice as high as for the printing
press used half-time; similarly, the utilization rate of labor is higher in the restau-
rant during lunch hour. The actual usage of the capital stock in production, which
we call capital services, equals the utilization rate of capital times the stock of capi-
tal, or u
K
K. Capital services are a more accurate measure of the contribution of the
capital stock to output than is the level of capital itself, because the deﬁnition of
capital services adjusts for the intensity at which capital is used. Similarly, we
deﬁne labor services to be the utilization rate of labor times the number of workers
(or hours) employed by the ﬁrm, or u
N
N. Thus the labor services received by an
employer are higher when the same number of workers are working rapidly than
when they are working slowly (that is, the utilization of labor is higher).
Recognizing that capital services and labor services go into the production of
output, we rewrite the production function as
(10.2)
where we have replaced the capital stock, K, with capital services, u
K
K, and labor,
N, with labor services, u
N
N. Now we can use the production function in Eq. (10.2)
to substitute for Y in Eq. (10.1) to obtain an expression for the Solow residual that
incorporates utilization rates for capital and labor:
(10.3)
Equation (10.3) shows that the Solow residual, as conventionally measured,
includes not only parameter A (which reﬂects technology and perhaps other factors
affecting productivity) but also utilization rates of capital and labor, u
K
and u
N
.
Thus, even if technology were unchanging, the calculated Solow residual would be
procyclical if the utilization rates of capital and labor were procyclical.
There is evidence that utilization is procyclical (so that capital and labor are
worked harder in boom periods than in economic slumps). For example, Craig

Changes in technology might well be correlated with changes in government spending on research
and development (R&D). However, the Solow residual is also highly correlated with non-R&D gov-
ernment spending and with lags too short to be accounted for by the effects of spending on the rate of
invention.

Burnside of Duke University, Martin Eichenbaum of Northwestern University, and
Sergio Rebelo
11
of Northwestern University studied the cyclical behavior of capital
utilization by using data on the amount of electricity used by producers. Their
rationale for using data on electricity is that additional electricity is needed to
increase capital utilization, whether the increased utilization is achieved by oper-
ating capital for an increased number of hours per day or by increasing the speed
at which the capital is operated. This study revealed that electricity used per unit
of capital rises in economic upturns, leading the authors to conclude that capital
utilization is strongly procyclical. In addition, this study showed that a measure of
technology, analogous to the term A in Eq. (10.2), is much less procyclical than is the
Solow residual.
Measuring the cyclical behavior of labor utilization is more difﬁcult, but vari-
ous studies have found evidence that the utilization rate of labor is also procyclical.
For example, Jon Fay and James Medoff
12
of Harvard University sent question-
naires to large manufacturing enterprises, asking about employment and produc-
tion during the most recent downturn experienced at each plant. Fay and Medoff
found that during a downturn the average plant surveyed cut production by 31%
and cut its total use of blue-collar hours to 23% below the normal level. Plant man-
agers estimated that total hours could have been reduced by an additional 6% of
the normal level without further reducing output. Of this 6% of normal hours,
about half (3% of normal hours) were typically assigned to various types of useful
work, including equipment maintenance and overhaul, painting, cleaning, rework-
ing output, and training. The remaining 3% of normal hours were assigned to
“make-work” and other unproductive activities. These numbers suggest that ﬁrms
utilize labor less intensively during recessions.
The tendency to use workers less intensively in recessions than in expansions
has been referred to as labor hoarding. Labor hoarding occurs when, because of the
costs of ﬁring and hiring workers, ﬁrms retain some workers in a recession that
they would otherwise lay off. Firms keep these workers on the payroll to avoid the
costs of laying off workers and then rehiring them or hiring and training new
workers when the economy revives. Hoarded labor either works less hard during
the recession (there is less to do) or is put to work doing tasks, such as maintaining
equipment, that aren’t measured as part of the ﬁrm’s output. When the economy
revives, the hoarded labor goes back to working in the normal way. In much the
same way, it may not pay the restaurant owner to send her workers home between
the lunch and dinner rush hours, with the result that restaurant workers are less
productive during the slow afternoon period. This lower rate of productivity
during recessions (or during the afternoon slow period, in the restaurant) doesn’t
reﬂect changes in the available technology, but only changes in the rate at which
ﬁrms utilize capital and labor. Hence you should be cautious about interpreting
cyclical changes in the Solow residual (equivalently, total factor productivity, A) as
solely reﬂecting changes in technology.
Although changes in technology or the utilization rates of capital and labor
might cause aggregate cyclical ﬂuctuations, history suggests that shocks other than

Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 371
productivity shocks also affect the economy; wars and the corresponding military
buildups are but one obvious example. Thus many classical economists favor a
broader deﬁnition of classical business cycle theory that allows for both produc-
tivity and other types of shocks to have an impact on the economy. Because the
models they use allow for shocks other than “real” productivity shocks, the models
are not called RBC models but rather dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium
(DSGE) models, as they model behavior over time (dynamic), allow for shocks to
the economy (stochastic), and are based on general equilibrium concepts.
The macroeconomic effects of shocks other than productivity shocks can be
analyzed with the classical IS–LM model. Let’s use it to examine the effects of a
ﬁscal policy shock.
Fiscal Policy Shocks in the Classical Model
Another type of shock that can be a source of business cycles in the classical model
is a change in ﬁscal policy, such as an increase or decrease in real government pur-
chases of goods and services.
13
Examples of shocks to government purchases
include military buildups and the initiation of large road-building or other public
works programs. Because government purchases are procyclical—and in particu-
lar, because national output tends to be above normal during wars and at other
times when military spending is high—we need to explore how shocks to govern-
ment purchases affect aggregate output and employment.
Let’s consider what happens when the government purchases more goods, as
it would, for example, when the country is at war. (Think of the increase in gov-
ernment purchases as temporary. Analytical Problem 2 at the end of the chapter
asks you to work out what happens if the increase in government purchases is per-
manent.)
Figure 10.4 illustrates the effects of an increase in government purchases in the
classical IS–LM model. Before the ﬁscal policy change, the economy’s general equi-
librium is represented by point E in both (a) and (b). To follow what happens after
purchases rise, we start with the labor market in Fig. 10.4(a). The change in ﬁscal
policy doesn’t affect the production function or the marginal product of labor (the
MPN curve), so the labor demand curve doesn’t shift.
However, classical economists argue that an increase in government purchas-
es will affect labor supply by reducing workers’ wealth. People are made less
wealthy because, if the government increases the amount of the nation’s output
that it takes for military purposes, less output will be left for private consumption
and investment. This negative impact of increased government purchases on pri-
vate wealth is most obvious if the government pays for its increased military
spending by raising current taxes.
14
However, even if the government doesn’t raise
current taxes to pay for the extra military spending and borrows the funds it needs,
13
Another important example of a change in ﬁscal policy is a change in the structure of the tax code.
Classical economists argue that the greatest effects of tax changes are those that affect people’s incen-
tives to work, save, and invest, and thus affect full-employment output. However, because most clas-
sical economists accept the Ricardian equivalence proposition, they wouldn’t expect lump-sum
changes in taxes without accompanying changes in government purchases to have much effect on the
economy.
14
For simplicity, we assume that the tax increase is a lump sum. A tax increase that isn’t a lump sum—
for example, one that changes the effective tax rate on capital—has complicating effects.

Figure 10.4
Effects of a temporary increase in government purchases
Initial equilibrium is at point E in both (a) and (b).
(a) A temporary increase in government purchases raises workers’ current or future taxes. Because workers feel poorer,
they supply more labor and the labor supply curve shifts to the right, from NS
1
to NS
2
. The shift in the labor supply curve
reduces the real wage and increases employment, as indicated by point F.
(b) The increase in employment raises full-employment output and shifts the FE line to the right, from FE
1
to FE
2
. The
increase in government purchases also reduces desired national saving and shifts the IS curve up and to the right, from IS
1
to IS
2
. Because the intersection of IS
2
and LM
1
is to the right of FE
2
, the aggregate quantity of output demanded is higher
than the full-employment level of output, 
2
, so the price level rises. The rise in the price level reduces the real money
supply and shifts the LM curve up and to the left, from LM
1
to LM
2
, until the new general equilibrium is reached at point F.
The effect of the increase in government purchases is to increase output, the real interest rate, and the price level.

taxes will still have to be raised in the future to pay the principal and interest on
this extra government borrowing. So, whether or not taxes are currently raised,
under the classical assumption that output is always at its full-employment level,
an increase in government military spending effectively makes people poorer.
In Chapter 3 we showed that a decrease in wealth increases labor supply
because someone who is poorer can afford less leisure. Thus, according to the clas-
sical analysis, an increase in government purchases—which makes people ﬁnan-
cially worse off—should lead to an increase in aggregate labor supply.

The
15
In theory, the effect on labor supply of an increase in government purchases should be the strongest
for spending, such as military spending, that extracts resources without providing any direct beneﬁts to
the private sector. Government purchases that effectively replace private consumption expenditures—
for example, purchases of medical services, roads, or playgrounds—should in principle have a smaller
negative impact on people’s economic well-being and thus a smaller positive effect on labor supply.

increase in government purchases causes the labor supply curve to shift to the
right, from NS
1
to NS
2
in Fig. 10.4(a). Following the shift of the labor supply curve,
the equilibrium in the labor market shifts from point E to point F, with employment
increasing and the real wage decreasing.
16
The effects of the increase in government purchases in the classical IS–LM
framework are shown in Fig. 10.4(b). First, note that, because equilibrium employ-
ment increases, full-employment output, , also increases. Thus the FE line shifts
to the right, from FE
1
to FE
2
.
In addition to shifting the FE line to the right, the ﬁscal policy change shifts the
IS curve. Recall that, at any level of output, a temporary increase in government
purchases reduces desired national saving and raises the real interest rate that
clears the goods market. Thus the IS curve shifts up and to the right, from IS
1
to IS
2
.
(See also Summary table 12, p. 315.) The LM curve isn’t directly affected by the
change in ﬁscal policy.
The new IS curve, IS
2
, the initial LM curve, LM
1
, and the new FE line, FE
2
, have
no common point of intersection. For general equilibrium to be restored, prices
must adjust, shifting the LM curve until it passes through the intersection of IS
2
and
FE
2
(point F). Will prices rise or fall? The answer to this question is ambiguous
because the ﬁscal policy change has increased both the aggregate demand for
goods (by reducing desired saving and shifting the IS curve up and to the right)
and the full-employment level of output (by increasing labor supply and shifting
the FE line to the right). If we assume that the effect on labor supply and full-
employment output of the increase in government purchases isn’t too large (prob-
ably a reasonable assumption), after the ﬁscal policy change the aggregate quantity
of goods demanded is likely to exceed full-employment output. In Fig. 10.4(b) the
aggregate quantity of goods demanded (point H at the intersection of IS
2
and LM
1
)
exceeds full-employment output, 
2
. Thus the price level must rise, shifting the LM
curve up and to the left and causing the economy to return to general equilibrium
at F. At F both output and the real interest rate are higher than at the initial equi-
librium point, E.
Therefore the increase in government purchases increases output, employ-
ment, the real interest rate, and the price level. Because the increase in employment
is the result of an increase in labor supply rather than an increase in labor demand,
real wages fall when government purchases rise. Because of diminishing margin-
al productivity of labor, the increase in employment also implies a decline in aver-
age labor productivity when government purchases rise.
That ﬁscal shocks play some role in business cycles seems reasonable, which is
itself justiﬁcation for including them in the model. However, including ﬁscal shocks
along with productivity shocks in the RBC model has the additional advantage of
improving the match between model and data. We previously noted that govern-
ment purchases are procyclical, which is consistent with the preceding analysis.
Another advantage of adding ﬁscal shocks to a model that also contains produc-
tivity shocks is that it improves the model’s ability to explain the behavior of labor
productivity.
Refer back to Fig. 10.2 to recall a weakness of the RBC model with only pro-
ductivity shocks: It predicts that average labor productivity and GNP are highly

16
Note that this labor supply effect was omitted from our discussion of the impact of increased gov-
ernment purchases in Chapter 4, as illustrated in Fig. 4.9.

374 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
correlated. In fact, RBC theory predicts a correlation that is more than twice the
actual correlation. However, as we have just shown, a classical business cycle
model with shocks to government purchases predicts a negative correlation
between labor productivity and GNP because a positive shock to government pur-
chases raises output but lowers average productivity. A classical business cycle
model that includes both shocks to productivity and shocks to government pur-
chases can match the empirically observed correlation of productivity and GNP
well, without reducing the ﬁt of the model in other respects.
17
Thus adding ﬁscal
shocks to the real business cycle model seems to improve its ability to explain the
actual behavior of the economy.
Should Fiscal Policy Be Used to Dampen the Cycle? Our analysis shows that
changes in government purchases can have real effects on the economy. Changes
in the tax laws can also have real effects on the economy in the classical model,
although these effects are more complicated and depend mainly on the nature of
the tax, the type of income or revenue that is taxed, and so on. Potentially, then,
changes in ﬁscal policy could be used to offset cyclical ﬂuctuations and stabilize
output and employment; for example, the government could increase its
purchases during recessions. This observation leads to the second of the two
questions posed in the introduction to the chapter: Should policymakers use ﬁscal
policy to smooth business cycle ﬂuctuations?
Recall that classical economists generally oppose active attempts to dampen
cyclical ﬂuctuations because of Adam Smith’s invisible-hand argument that free
markets produce efﬁcient outcomes without government intervention. The classi-
cal view holds that prices and wages adjust fairly rapidly to bring the economy into
general equilibrium, allowing little scope for the government to improve the
macroeconomy’s response to economic disturbances. Therefore, although in prin-
ciple ﬁscal policy could be used to ﬁght recessions and reduce output ﬂuctuations,
classical economists advise against using this approach. Instead, classicals argue
that not interfering in the economy’s adjustment to disturbances is better.
This skepticism about the value of active antirecessionary policies does not
mean that classical economists don’t regard recessions as a serious problem. If an
adverse productivity shock causes a recession, for example, real wages, employ-
ment, and output all fall, which means that many people experience economic
hardship. But would offsetting the recession by, for example, increasing govern-
ment purchases help? In the classical analysis, a rise in government purchases
increases output by raising the amount of labor supplied, and the amount of labor
supplied is increased by making workers poorer (as a result of higher current or
future taxes). Thus, under the classical assumption that the economy is always in
general equilibrium, increasing government purchases for the sole purpose of
increasing output and employment makes people worse off rather than better off.
Classical economists conclude that government purchases should be increased
only if the beneﬁts of the expanded government program—in terms of improved
military security or public services, for example—exceed the costs to taxpayers.

sis of this paper is technically complex but it gives a ﬂavor of research in classical business cycle
analysis.

Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 375
Classicals apply this criterion for useful government spending—that the beneﬁts
should exceed the costs—whether or not the economy is currently in recession.
So far we have assumed that, because ﬁscal policy affects the equilibrium
levels of employment and output, the government is capable of using ﬁscal policy
to achieve the levels of employment and output it chooses. In fact, the legislative
process can lead to lengthy delays, or lags, between the time that a ﬁscal policy
change is proposed and the time that it is enacted. Additional lags occur in imple-
menting the new policies and in the response of the economy to the policy changes.
Because of these lags, ﬁscal policy changes contemplated today should be based on
where the economy will be several quarters in the future; unfortunately, forecasting
the future of the economy is an inexact art at best. Beyond the problems of fore-
casting, policymakers also face uncertainties about how and by how much to
modify their policies to get the desired output and employment effects. Classical
economists cite these practical difﬁculties as another reason for not using ﬁscal
policy to ﬁght recessions.
Unemployment in the Classical Model
A major weakness of the classical model is that it doesn’t explain why unemploy-
ment rises during business downturns. Indeed, in the simple classical, or supply–
and–demand, model of the labor market, unemployment is literally zero: Anyone
who wants to work at the market-clearing wage can ﬁnd a job. Of course, in reali-
ty unemployment is never zero. Furthermore, the sharp increases in unemploy-
ment that occur during recessions are a principal reason that policymakers and the
public are so concerned about economic downturns.
Classical economists are perfectly aware of this issue, and they have developed
more sophisticated versions of the classical business cycle model to account for
unemployment. The main modification they make to the simple
supply–and–demand model of the labor market is to drop the model’s implicit
assumption that all workers and jobs are the same. Rather than all being the same,
workers in the real world have different abilities, skills, and interests, among other
things; jobs entail different skill requirements, work environments, locations, and
other characteristics. Because workers and jobs both vary in so many ways, match-
ing workers to jobs isn’t instantaneous and free, but time-consuming and costly.
The fact that someone who has lost a job or has just entered the labor force must
spend time and effort to ﬁnd a new job helps explain why there always are some
unemployed people.
Some classical economists suggest that differences among workers and among
jobs explain not only why the unemployment rate is always greater than zero, but
also why unemployment rises so sharply in recessions. They argue that produc-
tivity shocks and other macroeconomic disturbances that cause recessions also
often increase the degree of mismatch between workers and ﬁrms.
18
Thus a major
adverse productivity shock might affect the various industries and regions within
the country differently, with jobs being destroyed in some sectors but new oppor-
tunities emerging in others. An oil price shock, for example, would eliminate jobs
18
This idea was proposed in David Lilien, “Sectoral Shifts and Cyclical Unemployment,” Journal of
Political Economy, August 1982, pp. 777–793.
M10_ABEL4529_07_SE_C10.QXD  12/10/09  12:44 AM  Page 375
376 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
in energy-intensive industries but create new opportunities in industries that
supply energy or are light energy users.
Following such a shock, workers in industries and regions where labor
demand has fallen will be induced to search elsewhere for jobs, which raises the
frictional component of unemployment. Some of these workers will ﬁnd that their
skills don’t match the requirements of industries with growing labor demand;
these workers may become chronically unemployed, raising structural unemploy-
ment.
19
With many unemployed workers looking for jobs, and because creating
new jobs takes a while, the time necessary to ﬁnd a new job is likely to increase. For
all these reasons, an adverse productivity shock may raise unemployment as well
as reduce output and employment. Note that this predicted rise in frictional and
structural unemployment during recessions is the same as an increase in the nat-
ural rate of unemployment (the sum of frictional and structural unemployment
rates).
What is the evidence of worker–job mismatch and unemployment? The process
of job creation and job destruction in U.S. manufacturing has been studied in some
detail by Steven Davis of the University of Chicago and John Haltiwanger
20
of the
University of Maryland. Using data for 160,000 manufacturing plants, the authors
showed that, during the 1973–1986 period, about 11% of all existing manufacturing
jobs disappeared, on average, each year, reﬂecting plant closings and cutbacks. During
a typical year, about 81% of these lost jobs were replaced by newly created jobs else-
where in the manufacturing sector (so that, overall, employment in manufacturing
shrank over the period). Thus Davis and Haltiwanger conﬁrmed that a great deal of
“churning” of jobs and workers occurs in the economy. They also showed that much
of this churning reﬂected closing of old plants and opening of new ones within the same
industries, rather than a general decline in some industries and growth in others. Thus
reallocation of workers within industries seems to be as important as movement of
workers between industries as a source of unemployment.
Figure 10.5 shows the rates of job creation and destruction in U.S. nonfarm pri-
vate businesses for the years 1977–2005.
21
You can see that in recession years, such
as 1981–1982, 1990–1991, and 2001, many more jobs were destroyed than created—
although a signiﬁcant number of new jobs were created even in recession years,
reﬂecting shifts of workers among ﬁrms and industries.
It seems clear that increased mismatches between workers and jobs can’t
account for all the increase in unemployment that occurs during recessions. Much of
that increase is in the form of temporary layoffs; rather than search for new jobs,
many workers who are temporarily laid off simply wait until they are called back by
their old ﬁrm. Moreover, if recessions were times of increased mismatch in the labor
market, more postings of vacancies and help-wanted ads during recessions would

The data shown in Fig. 10.5 are published by the Census Bureau, based on the methods developed
by Davis and Haltiwanger in the paper cited in footnote 20. Job creation and destruction data are
based on data collected from business ﬁrms; job creation is net new jobs from expanding establish-
ments and job destruction is the net loss of jobs from contracting establishments. By comparison, the
data in Figs. 8.10 and 8.11 on the job ﬁnding rate and the job loss rate are based on data on individu-
als and show the probability that a given worker found or lost a job in a given month. Thus, there
may be substantial differences between job creation and job ﬁnding, as well as between job destruc-
tion and job loss.

be expected; in fact, both vacancies and new job openings fall in recessions.
22
Despite these objections, however, economists generally agree that the dynamic
reallocation of workers from shrinking to growing sectors is an important source of
unemployment.
Modifying the classical model to allow for unemployment doesn’t change the
classical view that ﬁscal policy should not be actively used to combat recessions.
Classical economists point out that raising the aggregate demand for goods (by
increasing government purchases, for example) doesn’t directly address the prob-
lem of unemployment arising from the mismatch that exists at the microeconomic
level between workers and jobs. A better approach, in the classical view, is to elim-
inate barriers to labor market adjustment, such as high legal minimum wages that
price low-skilled workers out of the labor market or burdensome regulations that
raise businesses’ costs of employing additional workers.
Household Production
In recent years, researchers have found that the RBC model can better match the
U.S. data on business cycles if the model explicitly accounts for household pro-
duction, which is output produced at home instead of in a market. Household

gate Disturbances?” Journal of Political Economy, June 1986, pp. 507–522.

378 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
production includes such goods and services as cooking, child care, sewing, and
food grown in a home garden.
The U.S. national income accounts described in Chapter 2 count mainly the
output of businesses, not households. But people clearly switch between the two.
For example, when times are good and a person is employed, she may hire some-
one else to mow her lawn. Because those lawn-mowing services are paid for in a
market, they count in GDP . But if times are bad, someone losing her job may mow
the lawn herself; such services are not counted in GDP but nonetheless represent
output.
When household production is incorporated into an RBC model, the match
between the model and the data improves, as shown by Jeremy Greenwood of the
University of Pennsylvania, Richard Rogerson of Arizona State University, and
Randall Wright of the University of Wisconsin.
23
A household-production model
has a higher standard deviation of (market) output than a standard RBC model and
more closely matches the U.S. data.
Models with household production may also be used to improve our under-
standing of foreign economies, especially those not as well developed as the United
States. In less-developed countries, a greater proportion of output is produced at
home, such as home-sewn clothes and food grown in a home garden. In their
study of development, Stephen L. Parente of the University of Illinois, Richard
Rogerson, and Randall Wright
24
show that once household production is account-
ed for, income differences across countries are not as big as the GDP data suggest.
So, modeling household production is vital in understanding differences in the
well-being of people in different countries.
10.2 Money in the Classical Model
So far we have focused on real shocks to the economy, such as productivity shocks
and changes in government purchases. However, many macroeconomists believe
that nominal shocks—shocks to money supply and money demand—also affect the
business cycle. In the rest of the chapter we discuss the role of money and monetary
policy in the classical approach to the business cycle.
Monetary Policy and the Economy
Monetary policy refers to the central bank’s decisions about how much money to
supply to the economy (Chapter 7). Recall that the central bank (the Federal
Reserve in the United States) can control the money supply through open market
operations, in which it sells government bonds to the public in exchange for money
(to reduce the money supply) or uses newly created money to buy bonds from the
public (to increase the money supply).
In Chapter 9 we examined the effects of changes in the money supply, using the
IS–LM model (Fig. 9.9) and the AD–AS model (Fig. 9.14). With both models we

Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 379
found that, after prices fully adjust, changes in the money supply are neutral: A
change in the nominal money supply, M, causes the price level, P, to change pro-
portionally, but a change in the money supply has no effect on real variables, such
as output, employment, or the real interest rate. Our analysis left open the possi-
bility that a change in the money supply would affect real variables, such as output,
in the short run before prices had a chance to adjust. However, because classical
economists believe that the price adjustment process is rapid, they view the period
of time during which the price level is ﬁxed—and money is not neutral—to be too
short to matter. That is, for practical purposes, they view money as neutral for any
relevant time horizon.
Monetary Nonneutrality and Reverse Causation
The prediction that money is neutral is a striking result of the classical model, but
it seems inconsistent with the business cycle fact that money is a leading, pro-
cyclical variable. If an expansion of the money supply has no effect, why are
expansions of the money supply typically followed by increased rates of eco-
nomic activity? And, similarly, why are reductions in the money supply often
followed by recessions?
Some classical economists have responded to these questions by pointing out
that, although increases in the money supply tend to precede expansions in output,
this fact doesn’t necessarily prove that economic expansions are caused by those
increases. After all, just because people put storm windows on their houses before
winter begins doesn’t mean that winter is caused by putting on storm windows.
Rather, people put storm windows on their houses because they know that winter
is coming.
Many classical economists, including RBC economists in particular, argue that
the link between money growth and economic expansion is like the link between
putting on storm windows and the onset of winter, a relationship they call reverse
causation. Speciﬁcally, reverse causation means that expected future increases in
output cause increases in the current money supply and that expected future
decreases in output cause decreases in the current money supply, rather than the
other way around. Reverse causation explains how money could be a procyclical
and leading variable even if the classical model is correct and changes in the money
supply are neutral and have no real effects.
25
Reverse causation might arise in one of several ways. One possibility (which
you are asked to explore in more detail in Analytical Problem 4 at the end of the
chapter) is based on the idea that money demand depends on both expected future
output and current output. Suppose that a ﬁrm’s managers expect business to pick
up considerably in the next few quarters. To prepare for this expected increase in
output, the ﬁrm may need to increase its current transactions (for example, to pur-
chase raw materials, hire workers, and so on) and thus it will demand more money
now. If many ﬁrms do so, the aggregate demand for money may rise in advance of
the actual increase in output.
25
Robert King and Charles Plosser, “Money, Credit, and Prices in a Real Business Cycle,” American
Economic Review, June 1984, pp. 363–380, explain reverse causation and present supporting evidence
for the idea.
M10_ABEL4529_07_SE_C10.QXD  12/10/09  12:44 AM  Page 379
380 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
Now suppose that the Fed observes this increase in the demand for money. If
the Fed does nothing, leaving the money supply unchanged, the increase in money
demand will cause the equilibrium value of the price level to fall. As one of the
Fed’s objectives is stable prices, it won’t like this outcome; to keep prices stable,
instead of doing nothing, the Fed should provide enough extra money to the econ-
omy to meet the higher money demand. But if the Fed does so, the money supply
will rise in advance of the increase in output, consistent with the business cycle
fact—even though money is neutral.
Undoubtedly, reverse causation explains at least some of the tendency of
money to lead output. However, this explanation doesn’t rule out the possibility
that changes in the money supply also sometimes cause changes in output so that
money is nonneutral. That is, a combination of reverse causation and monetary
nonneutrality could account for the procyclical behavior of money.
The Nonneutrality of Money: Additional Evidence
Because of reverse causation, the leading and procyclical behavior of money can’t
by itself establish that money is nonneutral. To settle the issue of whether money is
neutral, we need additional evidence. One useful source is a historical analysis of
monetary policy. The classic study is Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz’s, A
Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960.
26
Using a variety of sources, includ-
ing Federal Reserve policy statements and the journals and correspondence of
monetary policymakers, Friedman and Schwartz carefully described and analyzed
the causes of money supply ﬂuctuations and the interrelation of money and other
economic variables. They concluded (p. 676):
Throughout the near-century examined in detail we have found that:
1. Changes in the behavior of the money stock have been closely associated with
changes in economic activity, [nominal] income, and prices.
2. The interrelation between monetary and economic change has been highly stable.
3. Monetary changes have often had an independent origin; they have not been
simply a reﬂection of changes in economic activity.
The ﬁrst two conclusions restate the basic business cycle fact that money is pro-
cyclical. The third conclusion states that reverse causation can’t explain the entire
relationship between money and real income or output. Friedman and Schwartz
focused on historical episodes in which changes in the supply of money were not
(they argued) responses to macroeconomic conditions but instead resulted from
other factors such as gold discoveries (which affected money supplies under the
gold standard), changes in monetary institutions, or changes in the leadership of
the Federal Reserve. In the majority of these cases “independent” changes in
money growth were followed by changes in the same direction in real output. This
evidence suggests that money isn’t neutral.

generally agreed with the conclusion that money isn’t neutral. In particular, they
argued that since 1960 half a dozen additional episodes of monetary nonneutrali-
ty have occurred. Probably the most famous one occurred in 1979, when Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker announced that money supply procedures would
change and that the money growth rate would be reduced to ﬁght inﬂation. A
minor recession in 1980 and a severe downturn in 1981–1982 followed Volcker’s
change in monetary policy. An economic boom followed relaxation of the Fed’s
anti-inﬂationary monetary policy in 1982.
Because of the Friedman-Schwartz evidence and episodes such as the
1979–1982 Volcker policy (and a similar experience in Great Britain at the same
time), most economists now believe that money is not neutral. If we accept that evi-
dence, contrary to the prediction of the classical model, we are left with two choic-
es: Either we must adopt a different framework for macroeconomic analysis, or we
must modify the classical model. In Section 10.3 we take the second approach and
consider how monetary nonneutrality can be explained in a classical model.
10.3 The Misperceptions Theory and the Nonneutrality of Money
According to the classical model, prices do not remain ﬁxed for any substantial
period of time, so the horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve developed in
Chapter 9 is irrelevant. The only relevant aggregate supply curve is the long-run
aggregate supply curve, which is vertical. As we showed in Fig. 9.14, changes in the
money supply cause the AD curve to shift; because the aggregate supply curve is
vertical, however, the effect of the AD shift is simply to change prices without
changing the level of output. Thus money is neutral in the classical model.
For money to be nonneutral, the relevant aggregate supply curve must not be
vertical. In this section, we extend the classical model to incorporate the assump-
tion that producers have imperfect information about the general price level and
thus sometimes misinterpret changes in the general price level as changes in the rel-
ative prices of the goods that they produce. We demonstrate that the assumption
that producers may misperceive the aggregate price level—the misperceptions
theory—implies a short-run aggregate supply curve that isn’t vertical. Unlike the
short-run aggregate supply curve developed in Chapter 9, however, the short-run
aggregate supply curve based on the misperceptions theory doesn’t require the
assumption that prices are slow to adjust. Even though prices may adjust instan-
taneously, the short-run aggregate supply curve slopes upward, so money is non-
neutral in the short run.
The misperceptions theory was originally proposed by Nobel laureate Milton
Friedman and then was rigorously formulated by another Nobel laureate, Robert E.
Lucas, Jr., of the University of Chicago.
28
According to the misperceptions theory,
the aggregate quantity of output supplied rises above the full-employment level, , when the
aggregate price level, P, is higher than expected. Thus for any expected price level, the
aggregate supply curve relating the price level and the aggregate quantity of output
supplied slopes upward.

382 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
If you took a course in the principles of economics, you learned that supply
curves generally slope upward, with higher prices leading to increased production.
However, just as the demand curves for individual goods differ from the aggregate
demand curve, the supply curves for individual goods differ from the aggregate
supply curve. An ordinary supply curve relates the supply of some good to the
price of that good relative to other prices. In contrast, the aggregate supply curve
relates the aggregate amount of output produced to the general price level. Changes
in the general price level can occur while the relative prices of individual goods
remain unchanged.
To understand the misperceptions theory and why it implies an upward-sloping
aggregate supply curve, let’s think about an individual producer of a particular
good, say bread. For simplicity, consider a bakery owned and operated by one
person, a baker. The baker devotes all his labor to making bread and earns all his
income from selling bread. Thus the price of bread is effectively the baker’s nominal
wage, and the price of bread relative to the general price level is the baker’s real
wage. When the relative price of bread increases, the baker responds to this increase
in his current real wage by working more and producing more bread. Similarly,
when the price of bread falls relative to the other prices in the economy, the baker’s
current real wage falls and he decreases the amount of bread he produces.
But how does an individual baker know whether the relative price of bread has
changed? To calculate the relative price of bread, the baker needs to know both the
nominal price of bread and the general price level. The baker knows the nominal
price of bread because he sells bread every day and observes the price directly.
However, the baker probably is not as well informed about the general price level,
because he observes the prices of the many goods and services he might want to
buy less frequently than he observes the price of bread. Thus, in calculating the rel-
ative price of bread, the baker can’t use the actual current price level. The best he
can do is to use his previously formed expectation of the current price level to esti-
mate the actual price level.
Suppose that before he observes the current market price of bread, the baker
expected an overall inﬂation rate of 5%. How will he react if he then observes that
the price of bread increases by 5%? The baker reasons as follows: I expected the
overall rate of inﬂation to be 5%, and now I know that the price of bread has
increased by 5%. This 5% increase in the price of bread is consistent with what I
had expected. My best estimate is that all prices increased by 5%, and thus I think
that the relative price of bread is unchanged. There is no reason to change my
output.
The baker’s logic applies equally to suppliers of output in the aggregate. Sup-
pose that all suppliers expected the nominal price level to increase by 5% and that
in fact all prices do increase by 5%. Then each supplier will estimate that its relative
price hasn’t changed and won’t change its output. Hence, if expected inﬂation is
5%, an actual increase in prices of 5% won’t affect aggregate output.
For a change in the nominal price of bread to affect the quantity of bread
produced, the increase in the nominal price of bread must differ from the
expected increase in the general price level. For example, suppose that the baker
expected the general price level to increase by 5% but then observes that the
price of bread rises by 8%. The baker then estimates that the relative price of
bread has increased so that the real wage he or she earns from baking is higher.
In response to the perceived increase in the relative price, he or she increases the
production of bread.

Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 383
Again, the same logic applies to the economy in the aggregate. Suppose that
everyone expects the general price level to increase by 5%, but instead it actually
increases by 8%, with the prices of all goods increasing by 8%. Now all producers
will estimate that the relative prices of the goods they make have increased, and
hence the production of all goods will increase. Thus a greater than expected
increase of the price level will tend to raise output. Similarly, if the price level actu-
ally increases by only 2% when all producers expected a 5% increase, producers
will think that the relative prices of their own goods have declined; in response, all
suppliers reduce their output.
Thus, according to the misperceptions theory, the amount of output that pro-
ducers choose to supply depends on the actual general price level compared to the
expected general price level. When the price level exceeds what was expected, pro-
ducers are fooled into thinking that the relative prices of their own goods have
risen, and they increase their output. Similarly, when the price level is lower than
expected, producers believe that the relative prices of their goods have fallen, and
they reduce their output. This relation between output and prices is captured by the
equation
(10.4)
where b is a positive number that describes how strongly output responds
when the actual price level exceeds the expected price level. Equation (10.4)
summarizes the misperceptions theory by showing that output, Y, exceeds
full-employment output, , when the price level, P, exceeds the expected price
level, P
e
.
To obtain an aggregate supply curve from the misperceptions theory, we
graph Eq. (10.4) in Fig. 10.6. Given full-employment output, , and the expect-
ed price level, P
e
, the aggregate supply curve slopes upward, illustrating the
relation between the amount of output supplied, Y, and the actual price level,
P. Because an increase in the price level of ¢P increases the amount of the
output supplied by ¢Y = b¢P, the slope of the aggregate supply curve is ¢P/¢Y
= 1/b. Thus the aggregate supply curve is steep if b is small and is relatively
flat if b is large.
Point E helps us locate the aggregate supply curve. At E the price level, P,
equals the expected price level, P
e
, so that (from Eq. 10.4) the amount of output
supplied equals full-employment output, . When the actual price level is higher
than expected (P> P
e
), the aggregate supply curve shows that the amount of output
supplied is greater than ; when the price level is lower than expected (P < P
e
),
output is less than .
The aggregate supply curve in Fig. 10.6 is called the short-run aggregate supply
(SRAS) curve because it applies only to the short period of time that P
e
remains
unchanged. When P
e
rises, the SRAS curve shifts up because a higher value of P is
needed to satisfy Eq. (10.4) for given values of Yand . When P
e
falls, the SRAS
curve shifts down. In the long run, people learn what is actually happening to
prices, and the expected price level adjusts to the actual price level (P= P
e
). When
the actual price level equals the expected price level, no misperceptions remain and
producers supply the full-employment level of output. In terms of Eq. (10.4), in the
long run P equals P
e
, and output, Y, equals full-employment output, . In the long
run, then, the supply of output doesn’t depend on the price level. Thus, as in
Chapters 8 and 9, the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is vertical at the
point where output equals . Y

384 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
Monetary Policy and the Misperceptions Theory
Let’s now reexamine the neutrality of money in the extended version of the classi-
cal model based on the misperceptions theory. This framework highlights an
important distinction between anticipated and unanticipated changes in the money
supply: Unanticipated changes in the nominal money supply have real effects, but
anticipated changes are neutral and have no real effects.
Unanticipated Changes in the Money Supply. Suppose that the economy is
initially in general equilibrium at point E in Fig. 10.7, where AD
1
intersects SRAS
1
.
Here, output equals the full-employment level, , and the price level and the
expected price level both equal P
1
. Suppose that everyone expects the money
supply and the price level to remain constant but that the Fed unexpectedly and
without publicity increases the money supply by 10%. A 10% increase in the
money supply shifts the AD curve up and to the right, from AD
1
to AD
2
, such that
for a given Y, the price level on AD
2
is 10% higher than the price level on AD
1
.
With the expected price level equal to P
1
, the SRAS curve remains unchanged, still
passing through point E.
The increase in aggregate demand bids up the price level to the new equilibrium
level, P
2
, where AD
2
intersects SRAS
1
(point F). In the new short-run equilibrium at
F, the actual price level exceeds the expected price level and output exceeds .
Because the increase in the money supply leads to a rise in output, money isn’t
neutral in this analysis.
The reason money isn’t neutral is that producers are fooled. Each producer mis-
perceives the higher nominal price of her output as an increase in its relative price,
rather than as an increase in the general price level. Although output increases in
the short run, producers aren’t better off. They end up producing more than they
would have if they had known the true relative prices.

The misperceptions
theory holds that, for a
given value of the
expected price level, P

,
an increase in the actual
price level, P, fools pro-
ducers into increasing
output. This relationship
between output and the
price level is shown by
the short-run aggregate
supply (SRAS) curve.
Along the SRAS curve,
output equals when
prices equal their expect-
ed level (P = P

, at point
E), output exceeds 
when the price level is
higher than expected 
(P 7 P
e
), and output is
less than when the
price level is lower than
expected (P 6 P

). In the
long run, the expected
price level equals the
actual price level so that
output equals . Thus

An unanticipated
increase in the money
supply
If we start from the ini-
tial equilibrium at point
E, an unanticipated 10%
increase in the money
supply shifts the AD
curve up and to the right,
from AD
1
to AD
2
, such
that for a given Y, the
price level on AD
2
is 10%
higher than the price
level on AD
1
. The short-
run equilibrium is locat-
ed at point F, the
intersection of AD
2
and
the short-run aggregate
supply curve SRAS
1
,
where prices and output
are both higher than at
point E. Thus an unan-
ticipated change in the
money supply isn’t neu-
tral in the short run. In
the long run, people
learn the true price level
and the equilibrium
shifts to point H, the
intersection of AD
2
and
the long-run aggregate
supply curve LRAS. In
the long-run equilibrium
at H, the price level has
risen by 10% but output
returns to its full-
employment level, , so
that money is neutral in
the long run. As expecta-
tions of the price level
rise from P
1
to P
3
, the
SRAS curve also shifts
up until it passes
through H.

The economy can’t stay long at the equilibrium represented by point F because
at F the actual price level, P
2
, is higher than the expected price level, P
1
. Over time,
people obtain information about the true level of prices and adjust their expecta-
tions accordingly. The only equilibrium that can be sustained in the long run is one
in which people do not permanently underestimate or overestimate the price level
so that the expected price level and the actual price level are equal. Graphically,
when people learn the true price level, the relevant aggregate supply curve is the
long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve, along which P always equals P
e
. In Fig.
10.7 the long-run equilibrium is point H, the intersection of AD
2
and LRAS. At H
output equals its full-employment level, , and the price level, P
3
, is 10% higher
than the initial price level, P
1
. Because everyone now expects the price level to be
P
3
, a new SRAS curve with P
e
= P
3
, SRAS
2
, passes through H.
Thus, according to the misperceptions theory, an unanticipated increase in the
money supply raises output and isn’t neutral in the short run. However, an unan-
ticipated increase in the money supply is neutral in the long run, after people have
learned the true price level.
Anticipated Changes in the Money Supply. In the extended classical model based
on the misperceptions theory , the effects of an anticipated money supply increase are
different from the effects of a surprise money supply increase. Figure 10.8 illustrates
the effects of an anticipated money supply increase. Again, the initial general
equilibrium point is at E, where output equals its full-employment level and the
actual and expected price levels both equal P
1
, just as in Fig. 10.7. Suppose that the
Federal Reserve announces that it is going to increase the money supply by 10% and
that the public believes this announcement.
As we have shown, a 10% increase in the money supply shifts the AD curve, from
AD
1
to AD
2
, where for each output level Y, the price level P on AD
2
is 10% higher than
on AD
1
. However, in this case the SRAS curve also shifts up. The reason is that the

An anticipated
increase in the money
supply
The economy is in initial
equilibrium at point E
when the Fed publicly
announces a 10%
increase in the money
supply. When the money
supply increases, the AD
curve shifts up by 10%,
from AD
1
to AD
2
. In
addition, because the
increase in the money
supply is anticipated by
the public, the expected
price level increases by
10%, from P
1
to P

. Thus
the short-run aggregate
supply curve shifts up
from SRAS
1
to SRAS
2
.
The new short-run equi-
librium, which is the
same as the long-run
equilibrium, is at point
H. At H output is
unchanged at and the
price level is 10% higher
than in the initial equilib-
rium at E. Thus an antici-
pated increase in the

in the short run as well
as in the long run.

public’s expected price level rises as soon as people learn of the increase in the money

10% so that P
e
rises by 10%, from P
1
to P
3
. Then the new SRAS curve, SRAS
2
, passes
through point H in Fig. 10.8, where Y equals and both the actual and expected price
levels equal P
3
. The new equilibrium also is at H, where AD
2
and SRAS
2
intersect. At
the new equilibrium, output equals its full-employment level, and prices are 10%
higher than they were initially. The anticipated increase in the money supply hasn’t
affected output but has raised prices proportionally. Similarly, an anticipated drop in
the money supply would lower prices but not affect output or other real variables. Thus
anticipated changes in the money supply are neutral in the short run as well as in the long run.
The reason is that, if producers know that increases in the nominal prices of their prod-
ucts are the result of an increase in the money supply and do not reﬂect a change in rel-
ative prices, they won’t be fooled into increasing production when prices rise.
Rational Expectations and the Role of Monetary Policy
In the extended classical model based on the misperceptions theory, unanticipated
changes in the money supply affect output, but anticipated changes in the money supply
are neutral. Thus, if the Federal Reserve wanted to use monetary policy to affect output,
it seemingly should use only unanticipated changes in the money supply . So, for exam-
ple, when the economy is in recession, the Fed would try to use surprise increases in the
money supply to raise output; when the economy is booming, the Fed would try to use
surprise decreases in the money supply to slow the economy.
A serious problem for this strategy is the presence of private economic fore-
casters and “Fed watchers” in ﬁnancial markets. These people spend a good deal of
time and effort trying to forecast macroeconomic variables such as the money
supply and the price level, and their forecasts are well publicized. If the Fed began
a pattern of raising the money supply in recessions and reducing it in booms,
forecasters and Fed watchers would quickly understand and report this fact. As a
Y
M10_ABEL4529_07_SE_C10.QXD  12/10/09  12:44 AM  Page 386
Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 387
result, the Fed’s manipulations of the money supply would no longer be unantici-
pated, and the changes in the money supply would have no effect other than pos-
sibly causing instability in the price level. More generally, according to the
misperceptions theory, to achieve any systematic change in the behavior of output,
the Fed must conduct monetary policy in a way that systematically fools the public.
But there are strong incentives in the ﬁnancial markets and elsewhere for people to
try to ﬁgure out what the Fed is doing. Thus most economists believe that attempts
by the Fed to surprise the public in a systematic way cannot be successful.
The idea that the Federal Reserve cannot systematically surprise the public is part
of a larger hypothesis that the public has rational expectations. The hypothesis of
rational expectations states that the public’s forecasts of various economic variables,
including the money supply, the price level, and GDP, are based on reasoned and
intelligent examination of available economic data.
29
(The evidence for rational
expectations is discussed in “In Touch with Data and Research: Are Price Forecasts
Rational?”, p. 388.) If the public has rational expectations, it will eventually understand
the Federal Reserve’s general pattern of behavior. If expectations are rational, purely
random changes in the money supply may be unanticipated and thus nonneutral.
However, because the Fed won’t be able to surprise the public systematically, it can’t
use monetary policy to stabilize output. Thus, even if smoothing business cycles were
desirable, according to the combination of the misperceptions theory and rational
expectations, the Fed can’t systematically use monetary policy to do so.
Propagating the Effects of Unanticipated Changes in the Money Supply. The
misperceptions theory implies that unanticipated changes in the money supply
are nonneutral because individual producers are temporarily fooled about the
price level. However, money supply data are available weekly and price level
data are reported monthly, suggesting that any misperceptions about monetary
policy or the price level—and thus any real effects of money supply changes—
should be quickly eliminated.
To explain how changes in the money supply can have real effects that last
more than a few weeks, classical economists stress the role of propagation mecha-
nisms. A propagation mechanism is an aspect of the economy that allows short-
lived shocks to have relatively long-term effects on the economy.
An important example of a propagation mechanism is the behavior of inven-
tories. Consider a manufacturing ﬁrm that has both a normal level of monthly
sales and a normal amount of ﬁnished goods in inventory that it tries to maintain.
Suppose that an unanticipated rise in the money supply increases aggregate
demand and raises prices above their expected level. Because increasing produc-
tion sharply in a short period of time is costly, the ﬁrm will respond to the increase
in demand partly by producing more goods and partly by selling some ﬁnished
goods from inventory, thus depleting its inventory stocks below their normal level.
Next month suppose that everyone learns the true price level and that the ﬁrm’s
rate of sales returns to its normal level. Despite the fact that the monetary shock has
passed, the ﬁrm may continue to produce for a while at a higher than normal rate.
The reason for the continued high level of production is that besides meeting its
normal demand, the ﬁrm wants to replenish its inventory stock. The need to rebuild
inventories illustrates a propagation mechanism that allows a short-lived shock (a
monetary shock, in this case) to have a longer-term effect on the economy.
29
The idea of rational expectations was ﬁrst discussed by John F. Muth in his classic 1961 paper, “Ratio-
nal Expectations and the Theory of Price Movements,” Econometrica, July 1961, pp. 315–335. However,
this idea wasn’t widely used in macroeconomics until the new classical “revolution” of the early 1970s.

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
Are Price Forecasts Rational?
Most classical economists assume that people have rational expectations about
economic variables; that is, people make intelligent use of available information in
forecasting variables that affect their economic decisions. The rational expectations
assumption has important implications. For example, as we have demonstrated, if
monetary nonneutrality is the result of temporary misperceptions of the price level
and people have rational expectations about prices, monetary policy is not able to
affect the real economy systematically.
The rational expectations assumption is attractive to economists—including
many Keynesian as well as classical economists—because it ﬁts well economists’
presumption that people intelligently pursue their economic self-interests. If people’s
expectations aren’t rational, the economic plans that individuals make won’t gener-
ally be as good as they could be. But the theoretical attractiveness of rational expec-
tations obviously isn’t enough; economists would like to know whether people really
do have rational expectations about important economic variables.
The rational expectations idea can be tested with data from surveys, in which
people are asked their opinions about the future of the economy. To illustrate how
such a test would be conducted, suppose that we have data from a survey in which
people were asked to make a prediction of the price level one year in the future.
Imagine that this survey is repeated each year for several years. Now suppose
that, for each individual in the survey, we deﬁne
Suppose also that we let P
t
represent the price level that actually occurs in year t.
Then the individual’s forecast error for year t is the difference between the actual
price level and the individual’s forecast:
If people have rational expectations, these forecast errors should be unpre-
dictable random numbers. However, if forecast errors are consistently positive or
negative—meaning that people systematically tend to underpredict or overpredict
the price level—expectations are not rational. If forecast errors have a systematic
pattern—for example, if people tend to overpredict the price level when prices
have been rising in the recent past—again, expectations are not rational.
Early statistical studies of price level forecasts made by consumers, jour-
nalists, professional economists, and others tended to reject the rational expec-
tations theory. These studies, which were conducted in the late 1970s and early
1980s, followed the period in which inflation reached unprecedented levels, in
part because of the major increases in oil prices and expansionary monetary
policy in 1973–1974 and in 1979. It is perhaps not surprising that people found
forecasting price changes to be unusually difficult during such a volatile period.
More recent studies of price level forecasts have been more favorable to the
rational expectations theory. Michael Keane and David Runkle* of the Federal

CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. Classical business cycle analysis uses the classical
IS–LM model along with the assumption that wages
and prices adjust quickly to bring the economy into
general equilibrium.
2. The real business cycle (RBC) theory is a version of the
classical theory that emphasizes productivity shocks
(shocks to the production function) as the source of
business cycle fluctuations. In the classical IS–LM
model, a temporary decline in productivity reduces the
real wage, employment, and output, while raising the
real interest rate and the price level. The RBC theory
can account for the observed procyclical behavior of
employment, real wages, and labor productivity.
However, the prediction of the RBC theory that prices
are countercyclical is viewed by some as a failing.
3. The Solow residual is an empirical measure of total
factor productivity, A, in the production function. It
increases as a result of technical progress that increas-
es the amount of output that can be produced with
the same amounts of labor and capital services
(inputs). The Solow residual also changes as a result
of changes in the utilization rates of capital and labor.
It is procyclical at least partly because the utilization
rates of capital and labor are procyclical. The pro-
cyclical behavior of the utilization rate of labor may
reﬂect labor hoarding, which occurs when ﬁrms con-
tinue to employ workers during recessions but use
them less intensively or on tasks, such as mainte-
nance, that don’t contribute directly to measured
output.
4. Classical business cycle analysis allows for other
shocks to the economy besides changes in productiv-
ity, including changes in ﬁscal policy. According to
the classical IS–LM model, an increase in government
purchases raises employment, output, the real interest
rate, and the price level. Including both ﬁscal and pro-
ductivity shocks in the classical model improves its
ability to ﬁt the data. Although ﬁscal policy can affect
employment and output, classical economists argue
that it should not be used to smooth the business
cycle because the invisible hand leads the economy to
an efficient outcome without government interfer-
ence. Instead, decisions about government purchases
should be based on comparisons of costs and beneﬁts.
5. In the basic classical model (which includes RBC
theory), money is neutral, which means that changes
in the nominal money supply change the price level
proportionally but do not affect real variables such as
output, employment, and the real interest rate.
6. The basic classical model can account for the pro-
cyclical and leading behavior of money if there is
reverse causation—that is, if anticipated changes in
output lead to changes in the money supply in the
same direction. For example, if ﬁrms increase their
money demand in anticipation of future output
increases, and if the Fed (to keep the price level
stable) supplies enough extra money to meet the
increase in money demand, increases in the money
stock precede increases in output. This result holds
even though changes in the money stock don’t cause
subsequent changes in output.
7. Examination of historical monetary policy actions
suggests that money isn’t neutral. Friedman and
Schwartz identified occasions when the money
supply changed for independent reasons, such as
gold discoveries or changes in monetary institutions,
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis studied the price level forecasts of a panel of
professional forecasters that has been surveyed by the American Statistical
Association and the National Bureau of Economic Research since 1968. They
found no evidence to refute the hypothesis that the professional forecasters
had rational expectations. In another article, Dean Croushore
†
of the Univer-
sity of Richmond analyzed a variety of forecasts made not only by economists
and forecasters but also by members of the general public, as reported in sur-
veys of consumers. Croushore found that the forecasts of each of these groups
were broadly consistent with rational expectations, although there appeared
to be some tendency for expectations to lag behind reality in periods when
inflation rose or fell sharply.

The misperceptions
version of the AD–AS
model
The misperceptions ver-
sion of the AD–AS model
shows how the aggregate
demand for output and
the aggregate supply of
output interact to deter-
mine the price level and
output in a classical
model in which produc-
ers misperceive the
aggregate price level.

and changes in output followed these changes in the
money supply in the same direction. More recent
experiences, such as the severe economic slowdown
that followed Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker’s
decision to reduce money growth in 1979, also pro-
vide evidence for the view that money isn’t neutral.
8. The misperceptions theory is based on the idea that
producers have imprecise information about the cur-
rent price level. According to the misperceptions theory ,
the amount of output supplied equals the full-employ-
ment level of output, , only if the actual price level
equals the expected price level. When the price level is
higher than expected, suppliers are fooled into thinking
that the relative prices of the goods they supply have
risen, so they supply a quantity of output that exceeds
. Similarly, when the price level is lower than expect-
ed, the quantity of output supplied is less than .
9. The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve based
on the misperceptions theory slopes upward in
describing the relationship between output and the
actual price level, with the expected price level held
constant. In the long run, the price level equals the
expected price level so that the supply of output equals
Y
Y
Y
; thus the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is
a vertical line at the point where output equals .
10. With the upward-sloping SRAS curve based on the
misperceptions theory, an unanticipated increase in the
money supply increases output (and is thus
nonneutral) in the short run. However, because the
long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical, an unan-
ticipated increase in the money supply doesn’t affect
output (and so is neutral) in the long run. An
anticipated increase in the money supply causes price
expectations to adjust immediately and leads to no
misperceptions about the price level; thus an antici-
pated increase in the money supply is neutral in both
the short and long runs.
11. According to the extended classical model based on the
misperceptions theory, only surprise changes in the
money supply can affect output. If the public has ratio-
nal expectations about macroeconomic variables, includ-
ing the money supply, the Fed cannot systematically
surprise the public because the public will understand
and anticipate the Fed’s pattern of behavior. Thus clas-
sical economists argue that the Fed cannot systemati-
cally use changes in the money supply to affect output.

KEY DIAGRAM 8
Diagram Elements
■ The price level, P, is on the vertical axis, and the level
of output, Y, is on the horizontal axis.
■ The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the aggre-
gate quantity of output demanded at each price level.
It is identical to the AD curve in Key Diagram 7, p.
346. The aggregate amount of output demanded is
determined by the intersection of the IS and LM
curves (see Fig. 9.10). An increase in the price level, P,
M10_ABEL4529_07_SE_C10.QXD  12/10/09  12:45 AM  Page 390
Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 391
reduces the real money supply, shifting the LM curve
up and to the left and reducing the aggregate quanti-
ty of output demanded. Thus the AD curve slopes
downward.
■ The misperceptions theory is based on the assump-
tion that producers have imperfect information about
the general price level and hence don’t know precise-
ly the relative prices of their products. When produc-
ers misperceive the price level, an increase in the
general price level above the expected price level
fools suppliers into thinking that the relative prices of
their goods have increased, so all suppliers increase
output. The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve
shows the aggregate quantity of output supplied at
each price level, with the expected price level held
constant. Because an increase in the price level fools
producers into supplying more output, the short-run
aggregate supply curve slopes upward, as shown by
SRAS
1
.
■ The short-run aggregate supply curve, SRAS
1
, is
drawn so that the expected price level, P
e
, equals P
1
.
When the actual price level equals the expected price
level, producers aren’t fooled and so supply the full-
employment level of output, . Therefore at point
E, where the actual price level equals the expected
price level (both equal P
1
), the short-run aggre-
gate supply curve, SRAS
1
, shows that producers
supply .
■ In the long run, producers learn about the price level
and adjust their expectations until the actual price
level equals the expected price level. Producers then
supply the full-employment level of output, ,
regardless of the price level. Thus, the long-run
aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is vertical at Y= ,
just as in the basic AD–AS model in Key Diagram 7,
p. 346.

Y
Factors That Shift the Curves
■ The aggregate quantity of output demanded is deter-
mined by the intersection of the IS curve and the LM
curve. At a constant price level, any factor that shifts
the IS–LM intersection to the right increases the aggre-
gate quantity of goods demanded and thus also shifts
the AD curve up and to the right. Factors that shift
the AD curve are listed in Summary table 14, p. 340.
■ Any factor that increases full-employment output, ,
shifts both the short-run and the long-run aggregate
supply curves to the right. Factors that increase full-
employment output are listed in Summary table 11,
p. 312. An increase in government purchases, because it
induces workers to supply more labor, also shifts the
short-run and long-run aggregate supply curves to the
right in the classical model.
■ An increase in the expected price level shifts the
short-run aggregate supply curve up.
Analysis
■ The short-run equilibrium is at the intersection of the
AD curve and the SRAS curve. For example, if the
expected price level is P
1
, the SRAS curve is SRAS
1
, and
the short-run equilibrium is at point F. At F output, Y
1
,
is higher than the full-employment level, , and the
price level, P
2
, is higher than the expected price level,
P
1
. As producers obtain information about the price
level, the expected price level is revised upward, which
shifts the SRAS curve up. The long-run equilibrium is at
point H, where the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS)
curve intersects the AD curve. In the long run (1) output
equals , and (2) the price level equals the expected
price level (both equal P
3
). In the long run, when the
expected price level has risen to P
3
, the short-run aggre-
gate supply curve, SRAS
2
, passes through H.

NUMERICAL PROBLEMS
All numerical problems are available in 
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. In a certain economy the production function is
where Y is output, A is productivity , and N is total hours
worked. The marginal product of labor associated with
this production function is
Initially , A = 1.0, but a beneﬁcial productivity shock raises
A to 1.1.
a. The supply of labor is
where w is the real wage. Find the equilibrium levels
of output, hours worked, and the real wage before
and after the productivity shock. Recall (Chapter 3)
that the MPN curve is the same as the labor demand
curve, with the real wage replacing the MPN.
b. Repeat Part (a) if the labor supply is
c. Some studies show that the real wage is only
slightly procyclical. Assume for the sake of
NS = 10 + 0.8w.
NS = 45 + 0.1w,
MPN = A(100 - N).
Y = A(100N - 0.5N

),
argument that this finding is correct. Would a
calibrated RBC model fit the facts better if the
labor supply is relatively insensitive to the real
wage, or if it is relatively sensitive? Justify your
answer diagrammatically and relate it to
your answers to Parts (a) and (b).
2. An economy is described as follows.
Desired consumption C

= 600 + 0.5(Y - T) - 50r.
Desired investment I
d
= 450 - 50r.
Real money demand L = 0.5Y - 100i.
Full-employment output = 2210.
Expected inﬂation π
e
= 0.05.
In this economy the government always has a
balanced budget, so T = G, where T is total taxes
collected.
a. Suppose that M = 4320 and G = 150. Use the classical
IS–LM model to ﬁnd the equilibrium values of output,
the real interest rate, the price level, consumption, and
investment. (Hint: In the classical model, output
always equals its full-employment level.)
b. The money supply rises to 4752. Repeat Part (a). Is
money neutral?
c. With the money supply back at 4320, government
purchases and taxes rise to 190. Repeat Part (a).

Assume for simplicity that is ﬁxed (unaffected by
G). Is ﬁscal policy neutral in this case? Explain.
3. Consider the following economy.
Desired consumption C
d
= 250 + 0.5(Y – T) – 500r.
Desired investment I
d
= 250 – 500r.
Real money demand L = 0.5Y – 500i.
Full-employment output = 1000.
Expected inﬂation π
e
= 0.
a. Suppose that T = G = 200 and that M = 7650. Find
an equation describing the IS curve. Find an equa-
tion describing the LM curve. Finally, ﬁnd an equa-
tion for the aggregate demand curve. What are the
equilibrium values of output, consumption, invest-
ment, the real interest rate, and the price level?
Assume that there are no misperceptions about the
price level.
b. Suppose that T = G = 200 and that M = 9000. What
is the equation for the aggregate demand curve
now? What are the equilibrium values of output,
consumption, investment, the real interest rate, and
the price level? Assume that full-employment
output, , is ﬁxed.
c. Repeat Part (b) for T = G = 300 and M = 7650.
4. An economy has the following AD and AS curves.
AD curve Y = 300 + 30(M/P).
AS curve Y = + 10(P - P
e
).
Here, and M = 400.
a. Suppose that P
e
= 60. What are the equilibrium
values of the price level, P, and output, Y? (Hint:
The solutions for P in this Part and in Part (b) are
multiples of 10.)
b. An unanticipated increase raises the money supply
to M = 700. Because the increase is unanticipated,
P
e
remains at 60. What are the equilibrium values
of the price level, P, and output, Y?
c. The Fed announces that the money supply will be
increased to M = 700, which the public believes.
Now what are the equilibrium values of the price
level, P, the expected price level, P
e
, and output, Y?

ductivity, the capital stock, K, is fixed at 30, and
employment N is ﬁxed at 100. Output equals 100 in the
year 2009 and equals 105 in 2010.
a. Find the Solow residual in the years 2009 and 2010,
and its growth rate between those two years.

Solow residual between 2009 and 2010 and the growth

the same years? Assume that the rates of utilization of
capital and labor remain unchanged.
c. Repeat Part (b) under the assumption that utiliza-
tion of labor increases by 3% between 2009 and
2010. You will have to modify the production func-
tion along the lines of Eq. (10.2).
d. Repeat Part (b) under the assumption that the uti-
lization rates of both labor and capital increase by
3% between 2009 and 2010.
6. Try the following experiment: Flip a coin ﬁfty times, keep-
ing track of the results. Think of each “heads” as a small
positive shock that increases output by one unit; similar-
ly, think of each “tails” as a small negative shock that
reduces output by one unit. Let the initial value of output,
Y, be 50, and graph the level of output over time as it is hit
by the “positive” and “negative” shocks (coin ﬂips). For
example, if your ﬁrst four ﬂips are three heads and a tail,
output takes the values 51, 52, 53, 52. After ﬁfty ﬂips, have
your small shocks produced any large cycles in output?
7. In a particular economy the labor force (the sum of
employed and unemployed workers) is ﬁxed at 100 mil-
lion. In this economy, each month 1% of the workers
who were employed at the beginning of the month lose
their jobs, and 19% of the workers who were unem-
ployed at the beginning of the month ﬁnd new jobs.
a. The January unemployment rate is 5%. For the
rates of job loss and job ﬁnding given, what will the
unemployment rate be in February? In March?
b. In April an adverse productivity shock raises the
job loss rate to 3% of those employed. The job loss
rate returns to 1% in May, while the job ﬁnding rate
remains unchanged at 19% throughout. Find the
unemployment rate for April, May, June, and July.
8. (Appendix 10.B) Consider the following economy.
IS curve r = 2.47 - 0.0004Y.
Real money demand L = 0.5Y - 500(r + π

Short-run aggregate supply Y=+ 100(P - P

Here, r is the real interest rate, Y is output, and P is the

ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. The discovery of a new technology increases the expect-
ed future marginal product of capital.
a. Use the classical IS–LM model to determine the
effect of the increase in the expected future MPK on
current output, the real interest rate, employment,
real wages, consumption, investment, and the price
level. Assume that expected future real wages and
future incomes are unaffected by the new technol-
ogy. Assume also that current productivity is unaf-
fected.
b. Find the effects of the increase in the expected
future MPK on current output and prices from
the AD–AS diagram based on the misperceptions
theory. What accounts for the difference with
Part (a)?
2. Use the classical IS–LM model to analyze the effects of a
permanent increase in government purchases of 100 per
year (in real terms). The increase in purchases is ﬁnanced
by a permanent increase in lump-sum taxes of 100 per year.
a. Begin by ﬁnding the effects of the ﬁscal change on
the labor market. How does the effect of the per-
manent increase in government purchases of 100
compare with the effect of a temporary increase in
purchases of 100?
b. Because the tax increase is permanent, assume that
at any constant levels of output and the real interest
rate, consumers respond by reducing their con-
sumption each period by the full amount of the tax
increase. Under this assumption, how does the per-
manent increase in government purchases affect
desired national saving and the IS curve?
c. Use the classical IS–LM model to ﬁnd the effects of the
permanent increase in government purchases and
taxes on output, the real interest rate, and the price
level in the current period. What happens if con-
sumers reduce their current consumption by less than
100 at any level of output and the real interest rate?
3. Consider a business cycle theory that combines the clas-
sical IS–LM model with the assumption that temporary
changes in government purchases are the main source of
cyclical ﬂuctuations. How well would this theory explain
the observed cyclical behavior of each of the following
variables? Give reasons for your answers.
a. Employment
b. The real wage
c. Average labor productivity
d. Investment
e. The price level
4. This problem asks you to work out in more detail the
example of reverse causation described in the text. Sup-
pose that ﬁrms that expect to increase production in the
future have to increase their current transactions (for
example, they may need to purchase more raw materi-
als). For this reason, current real money demand rises
when expected future output rises.
a. Under the assumption that real money demand
depends on expected future output, use the classi-
cal IS–LM model to ﬁnd the effects of an increase in
expected future output on the current price level.
For simplicity, assume that any effects of the
increase in expected future output on the labor
market or on desired saving and investment are
small and can be ignored.
b. Suppose that the Fed wants to stabilize the current
price level. How will the Fed respond to the increase
in expected future output? Explain why the Fed’s
response is an example of reverse causation.
5. Starting from a situation with no government spending
and no taxes, the government introduces a foreign aid
program (in which domestically produced goods are
shipped abroad) and pays for it with a temporary 10%
tax on current wages. Future wages are untaxed.
What effects will the temporary wage tax have on
labor supply? Use the classical IS–LM model to ﬁnd the
effects of the ﬁscal change on output, employment,
the (before-tax) real wage, the real interest rate, and the
price level.
WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. According to the real business cycle theory, produc-
tivity shocks are an important source of business
cycles. Using the Cobb–Douglas production function
(for example, Eq. 3.2, p. 60) and annual data since
1961, calculate and graph U.S. total factor productivi-
ty. Use real GDP for Y, the capital stock from the
source listed in Table 3.1 for K, and civilian employ-
ment for N. Look for periods marked by sharp
changes up or down in productivity. How well do

Chapter 10 Classical Business Cycle Analysis: Market-Clearing Macroeconomics 395
these changes match up with the dates of business
cycle peaks and troughs? (See Chapter 8.)
2. This question asks you to study whether unanticipated
declines in the money stock tend to raise interest rates
and lead to recessions, as implied by the misperceptions
theory.
a. Using quarterly data from 1960 to the present,
deﬁne unanticipated money growth in each quarter
to be the rate of M2 growth (expressed as an annual
rate) from the preceding quarter to the current quar-
ter, minus average M2 growth over the preceding
four quarters. (Average M2 growth over the pre-
ceding four quarters is a simple approximation of
expected money growth.) Graph unanticipated
money growth along with the nominal three-month
Treasury bill interest rate. On a separate figure,
graph unanticipated money growth against the real
three-month Treasury bill interest rate (the nominal
rate minus the inﬂation rate). Are unanticipated
changes in M2 associated with changes in interest
rates in the theoretically predicted direction?
b. In a separate ﬁgure, graph unanticipated money
growth and the unemployment rate. Are increases
in the unemployment rate generally preceded by
periods in which unanticipated money growth is
negative?
What happens to unanticipated money growth
following increases in the unemployment rate?
Why do you think it happens? Why should the
response of this measure of unanticipated money
growth to increases in unemployment make you
worry about whether this measure captures the
unanticipated component of money growth?
3. Are people’s inﬂation forecasts rational? To investigate
this question, go to the Web site of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia at www.philadelphiafed.org.
Find the Web pages for Research and Data and look for
data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters on fore-
casts of CPI inﬂation. Then, go to FRED and get actual
data on the CPI. Make a plot showing the forecast of
inﬂation at a given date on the horizontal axis against
the actual inﬂation rate on the vertical axis. If forecasts
are rational, what pattern should you see in the data?
What pattern do you observe in your plot? Does the
evidence support the idea that people’s inﬂation fore-
casts are rational?

Worked-Out Numerical Exercise for
Solving the Classical AD–AS Model
with Misperceptions
Consider an economy that is described by the following equations:
The AD curve is identical to the AD curve derived in Appendix 9.A, Step 5. So, we
could have started with the functions for consumption, taxes, investment, and
money demand, as well as the money supply from Appendix 9.A, and derived this
AD curve.
The short-run equilibrium is found by the intersection of the AD curve and the

148,000/P = 1200 + 10P. Therefore 10P + 33 - 148,000/P = 0.
Now multiply both sides of this equation by P and divide both sides by 10 to

This quadratic equation has two solutions (known as roots): P = 120 and 
P=- 123 . [Hint: You can ﬁnd these roots either by using the formula for the roots of
a quadratic equation* or by factoring the quadratic equation to obtain (P - 120)(P +
123 ) = 0.] The positive root, P = 120, is the price level in short-run equilibrium. The
level of output in short-run equilibrium can be found by plugging P = 120 into
either the AD curve or the SRAS curve. In the AD curve, Y = 1166 + 148,000/P = 
1166 + 148,000/120 = 1166 + 1233 , so Y = 2400. In the SRAS curve, Y=+
10(P - P
e
) = 2500 + 10(120 - 130) = 2500 - 100, so Y = 2400.
In the long run, there are no misperceptions, so the long-run equilibrium is the
same as we found in Appendix 9.A, where Y = 2500 and P = 111.

An Algebraic Version of the Classical
AD–AS Model with Misperceptions
Building on the algebraic version of the AD–AS model developed in Appendix
9.B, in this appendix we derive an algebraic version of the classical AD–AS model
with misperceptions. We present algebraic versions of the aggregate demand
(AD) curve and the aggregate supply (AS) curve and then solve for the general
equilibrium.
The Aggregate Demand Curve
Because misperceptions by producers don’t affect the demand for goods, the aggre-
gate demand curve is the same as in Appendix 9.B. Recall from Eq. (9.B.24) that the
equation of the aggregate demand (AD) curve is
(10.B.1)
where the coefﬁcients of the IS curve, α
IS
and β
IS
, are given by Eqs. (9.B.15) and
(9.B.16), respectively, the coefﬁcients of the LM curve, α
LM
and β
LM
, are given by
Eqs. (9.B.20) and (9.B.21), respectively, and is the coefﬁcient of the nominal inter-
est rate in the money demand equation, Eq. (9.B.17).
The Aggregate Supply Curve
The short-run aggregate supply curve based on the misperceptions theory is rep-
resented by Eq. (10.4), which, for convenience, we repeat here:
(10.B.2)
where b is a positive number.
General Equilibrium
For a given expected price level, P
e
, the short-run equilibrium value of the price
level is determined by the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (Eq. 10.B.1)
and the short-run aggregate supply curve (Eq. 10.B.2). Setting the right sides of
Eqs. (10.B.1) and (10.B.2) equal and multiplying both sides of the resulting equa-
tion by P(β
IS

) and rearranging yields a quadratic equation for the price

The coefﬁcients a

could be positive, neg-
ative, or zero. Because both a
2

are positive, the solution of Eq. (10.B.3) yields
one positive value of P and one negative value of P. The price level can’t be nega-
tive, so the short-run equilibrium price level is the positive solution of this equa-
tion. Using the standard quadratic formula, we find the positive solution of
equation (10.B.3) to be
(10.B.4)
We obtain the short-run equilibrium level of output by substituting the value
of the price level from Eq. (10.B.4) into either the aggregate demand curve Eq.
(10.B.1) or the aggregate supply curve Eq. (10.B.2).
Note that an increase in the nominal money supply, M, increases the constant
a
0
and thus, according to Eq. (10.B.4), it increases the equilibrium price level.
Because an increase in M doesn’t affect the aggregate supply curve but does
increase the equilibrium price level, Eq. (10.B.2) shows that it increases output.
We focused on short-run equilibrium in this appendix. In the long run, the
actual price level equals the expected price level so that, according to Eq. (10.B.2),
output equals its full-employment level, . In the long run, the economy reaches
the general equilibrium described in Appendix 9.B.

CHAPTER 11
Keynesianism: The
Macroeconomics of Wage
and Price Rigidity
In Chapter 10 we presented the classical, or market-clearing, approach to business
cycle analysis. In the classical approach wages and prices are assumed to adjust
quickly so that markets are almost always in equilibrium. Classical economists
argue that business cycles represent the economy’s best response to disturbances,
such as productivity shocks, so there is little justiﬁcation for government attempts
to smooth the cycle.
In contrast to the classicals, Keynesians are less optimistic about the ability of
free-market economies to respond quickly and efﬁciently to shocks. One of the
central ideas of Keynesianism is that wages and prices are “rigid” or “sticky” and
do not adjust quickly to market-clearing levels. Wage and price rigidity implies that
the economy can be away from its general equilibrium for signiﬁcant periods of
time. Thus a deep recession is not an optimal response of the free market to outside
shocks; rather, it is a disequilibrium situation in which high unemployment reﬂects
an excess of labor supplied over labor demanded. Keynesians believe that the gov-
ernment should act to eliminate—or at least minimize—these periods of low
output and high unemployment.
As wage and price rigidity is the basis for Keynesian theory and policy rec-
ommendations, understanding the potential causes of rigidity is important. A
telling criticism that the classicals aimed at the Keynesians in the early 1970s was
that the Keynesians simply assumed that wages and prices are rigid, without
giving a good economic explanation of why these rigidities occur. After all, argued
the classicals, wages and prices are not simply “given” to the economy but are the
results of decisions made by millions of individuals and ﬁrms. If excessively high
wages are causing unemployment, why don’t unemployed workers offer to work
for lower wages until ﬁrms are willing to hire them? If prices aren’t at the levels at
which quantities supplied equal quantities demanded, why don’t ﬁrms just change
their prices? In effect, the classicals challenged the Keynesians to show how wage
and price rigidity could be consistent with the idea—basic to almost all of eco-
nomics—that individuals and ﬁrms are economically rational; that is, they do the
best they can for themselves when making economic decisions.
Keynesian researchers accepted this challenge and have made progress in
explaining wage and price rigidity in terms consistent with economic rationality. In
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:09 AM  Page 399
400 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
the ﬁrst part of this chapter we discuss some leading Keynesian explanations for
wage and price rigidity. We then show how slow adjustment of wages and prices
can be incorporated into the IS–LM model, converting it from a classical model to
a Keynesian model. Using this model, we discuss the Keynesian answers to the two
central questions about business cycles—namely, What causes business cycles?
and What should policymakers do about them?
11.1 Real-Wage Rigidity
Because Keynesian analysis and policy prescriptions depend so greatly on the
assumption that wages and prices do not move rapidly to clear markets, we begin
by discussing in some detail the possible economic reasons for slow or incomplete
adjustment. In this section we focus on the rigidity of real wages, and in Section
11.2 we look at the slow adjustment of prices.
The main reason that Keynesians bring wage rigidity into their analysis is
their dissatisfaction with the classical explanation of unemployment. Recall that
classicals believe that most unemployment, including the increases in unemploy-
ment that occur during recessions, arises from mismatches between workers and
jobs (frictional or structural unemployment). Keynesians don’t dispute that mis-
match is a major source of unemployment, but they are skeptical that it explains all
unemployment.
Keynesians are particularly unwilling to accept the classical idea that recessions
are periods of increased mismatch between workers and jobs. If higher unemploy-
ment during downturns reﬂected increased mismatch, Keynesians argue, reces-
sions should be periods of particularly active search by workers for jobs and by
ﬁrms for new employees. However, surveys suggest that unemployed workers
spend relatively little time searching for work (many are simply waiting, hoping to
be recalled to their old jobs), and help-wanted advertising and vacancy postings by
ﬁrms fall rather than rise during recessions. Rather than times of increased worker–
job mismatch, Keynesians believe that recessions are periods of generally low
demand for both output and workers throughout the economy.
To explain the existence of unemployment without relying solely on worker–
job mismatch, Keynesians argue for rejecting the classical assumption that real
wages adjust relatively quickly to equate the quantities of labor supplied and
demanded. In particular, if the real wage is above the level that clears the labor
market, unemployment (an excess of labor supplied over labor demanded) will
result. From the Keynesian perspective, the idea that the real wage moves “too
little” to keep the quantity of labor demanded equal to the quantity of labor sup-
plied is called real-wage rigidity.
Some Reasons for Real-Wage Rigidity
For a rigid real wage to be the source of unemployment, the real wage that ﬁrms are
paying must be higher than the market-clearing real wage, at which quantities of
labor supplied and demanded are equal. But if the real wage is higher than neces-
sary to attract workers, why don’t ﬁrms save labor costs by simply reducing the
wage that they pay, as suggested by the classical analysis?
Various explanations have been offered for why real wages might be rigid,
even in the face of an excess supply of labor. One possibility is that there are legal
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:09 AM  Page 400
Chapter 11 Keynesianism: The Macroeconomics of Wage and Price Rigidity 401
and institutional factors that keep wages high, such as the minimum-wage law and
union contracts. However, most U.S. workers are neither union members nor min-
imum-wage earners, so these barriers to wage cutting can’t be the main reason for
real-wage rigidity. Furthermore, the minimum wage in the United States is speci-
ﬁed in nominal terms so that workers who are paid the minimum wage would
have rigid nominal wages rather than rigid real wages. (Union contracts may help
explain real-wage rigidity in Western European and other countries in which a high
proportion of workers are unionized, and in which nominal wages are typically
adjusted for inﬂation so as to maintain the real wage at its negotiated level.)
Another explanation for why a ﬁrm might pay a higher real wage than it “has”
to is that this policy might reduce the ﬁrm’s turnover costs, or the costs associated
with hiring and training new workers. By paying a high wage, the ﬁrm can keep
more of its current workers, which saves the ﬁrm the cost of hiring and training
replacements. Similarly, by developing a reputation for paying well, the ﬁrm can
assure itself of more and better applicants for any position that it may have to ﬁll.
A third reason that ﬁrms might pay real wages above market-clearing levels is
that workers who are paid well may have greater incentives to work hard and
effectively. If highly paid workers are more productive, the ﬁrm may proﬁt from
paying its employees well, even though it could attract all the workers it needs at
a lower real wage. The idea that a worker’s productivity depends on the real wage
received, and that therefore ﬁrms may pay wages above the market-clearing level,
is the essence of the efﬁciency wage model. Because this model of wage determi-
nation has played a key role in recent Keynesian analyses and because it has several
interesting aspects, we focus on it for the remainder of this section.
The Efficiency Wage Model
If better-paid workers are more productive, ﬁrms may gain by paying wages higher
than the minimum necessary to attract workers. But why might a worker’s pro-
ductivity depend on the real wage received? The answer has both “carrot” and
“stick” aspects.
The carrot, or positive incentive, is based on the idea that workers who feel well
treated will work harder and more efﬁciently. George Akerlof,
1
a Nobel laureate at
the University of California at Berkeley, argued that workers who believe that their
employer is treating them fairly—say, by paying higher wages than required to
retain them and by not cutting wages in slack times—will in turn want to treat the
employer fairly by doing a good job. Akerlof called this motivation the gift exchange
motive because it’s similar to the one that leads people to exchange gifts.
The stick, or threat, aspect of why a ﬁrm would pay a higher wage than neces-
sary has been analyzed in an economic model called the “shirking” model of wage
determination.
2
According to the shirking model, if a worker is paid only the mini-
mum amount needed to attract her to a particular job, she won’t be too concerned
about the possibility of being ﬁred if she doesn’t perform well. After all, if the job
pays the minimum amount necessary to induce her to take the job, she isn’t much
happier with the job than without the job. In this case the worker will be more

402 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
inclined to take it easy at work and shirk her duties, and the employer will have to
bear the cost either of the shirking or of paying supervisors to make sure that the
work gets done. In contrast, a worker receiving a higher wage will place a greater
value on keeping her job (it’s not that easy to ﬁnd another job as good) and will
work hard to avoid being ﬁred for shirking.
The gift exchange idea and the shirking model both imply that workers’
effort on the job depends on the real wages they receive. Graphically, the rela-
tionship between the real wage and the level of effort is shown by the effort
curve in Fig. 11.1. The real wage, w, is measured along the horizontal axis, and the
level of effort, E, is measured along the vertical axis. The effort curve passes
through points O, A, and B. When real wages are higher, workers choose to work
harder, for either carrot or stick reasons; therefore the effort curve slopes upward.
We assume that the effort curve is S-shaped. At the lowest levels of the real wage,
workers make hardly any effort, and effort rises only slowly as the real wage
increases. At higher levels of the real wage, effort rises sharply, as shown by the
steeply rising portion of the curve. The curve ﬂattens at very high levels of the
real wage because there is some maximum level of effort that workers really
can’t exceed no matter how motivated they are.
Wage Determination in the Efficiency Wage Model
The effort curve shows that effort depends on the real wage, but what determines
the real wage? To make as much proﬁt as possible, ﬁrms will choose the level of the real
wage that gets the most effort from workers for each dollar of real wages paid. The amount
of effort per dollar of real wages equals the amount of effort, E, divided by the real
Figure 11.1
Determination of the

The effort curve shows
the relation between
worker effort, E, and the

receive, w. A higher real
wage leads to more
effort, but above a certain
point higher wages are
unable to spur effort
much, so the effort curve
is S-shaped. For any
point on the curve, the

wage, w. The ratio of E to w can be found graphically from Fig. 11.1. Consider, for
example, point A on the effort curve, at which the real wage w
A
induces workers to
supply effort E
A
. The slope of the line from the origin to A equals the height of the
curve at point A, E
A
, divided by the horizontal distance, w
A
. Thus the slope of the
line from the origin to A equals the amount of effort per dollar of real wages at A.
The real wage that achieves the highest effort per dollar of wages is at point B.
The slope of the line from the origin to B, which is the amount of effort per dollar of
real wage at B, is greater than the slope of the line from the origin to any other point
on the curve. In general, to locate the real wage that maximizes effort per dollar of
real wage, we draw a line from the origin tangent to the effort curve; the real wage at
the tangency point maximizes effort per dollar of real wage. We call the real wage
that maximizes effort or efﬁciency per dollar of real wages the efﬁciency wage. In
Fig. 11.1 the efﬁciency wage is w*, and the corresponding level of effort is E*.
The efﬁciency wage theory helps explain real-wage rigidity . Because the employ-
er chooses the real wage that maximizes effort received per dollar paid, as long as the
effort curve doesn’t change, the employer won’t change the real wage. Therefore the
theory implies that the real wage is permanently rigid and equals the efﬁciency wage.
Employment and Unemployment in the Efficiency Wage Model
According to the efﬁciency wage theory, the real wage is rigid at the level that max-
imizes effort per dollar of wages paid. We now consider how the levels of employ-
ment and unemployment in the labor market are determined.
The workings of the labor market when there is an efﬁciency wage are shown in
Fig. 11.2. The efﬁciency wage, w*, is indicated by a horizontal line. Because the efﬁ-
ciency wage is determined solely by the effort curve, for the purpose of analyzing
the labor market we can take w* to be ﬁxed. Similarly, we can take the level of
effort, E*, induced by the efﬁciency wage, w*, as ﬁxed at this stage of the analysis.
The upward-sloping curve is the standard labor supply curve, NS. As in the
classical model, this curve shows the number of hours of work that people would
like to supply at each level of the real wage.
3
The downward-sloping curve is the demand curve for labor in the efﬁciency wage
model. Recall from Chapter 3 that the amount of labor demanded by a ﬁrm depends on
the marginal product of labor, or MPN. Speciﬁcally , the labor demand curve is identical
to the MPN curve, which in turn relates the marginal product of labor, MPN, to the
quantity of labor input, N, being used. The MPN curve—and hence the labor demand
curve—slopes down because of the diminishing marginal productivity of labor.
In the classical model, the marginal product of labor depends only on the produc-
tion function and the capital stock. A complication of the efﬁciency wage model is that
the amount of output produced by an extra worker (or hour of work) also depends on
the worker’s effort. Fortunately, as we noted, the efﬁciency wage, w*, and the effort
level induced by that wage, E*, are ﬁxed at this stage of the analysis. Thus the labor
demand curve in Fig. 11.2, ND*, reﬂects the marginal product of labor when worker effort
is held ﬁxed at E*. As in the classical case, an increase in productivity or in the capital
stock shifts the labor demand curve, ND*, to the right. In addition, any change in the
effort curve that led to an increase in the optimal level of effort E* would raise the MPN,
and the labor demand curve, ND*, again would shift to the right.
3
For simplicity, we assume that the number of hours of labor that people want to supply doesn’t
depend on the effort they must exert while on the job.

Because the unemployment represented by the excess supply of labor persists even when the econo-
my is at full employment, it is considered part of structural unemployment.

Now we can put the elements of Fig. 11.2 together to show how employment is
determined. Point A on the labor demand curve, ND*, indicates that, when the real
wage is ﬁxed at w*, ﬁrms want to employ hours of labor. Point B on the labor
supply curve indicates that, when the real wage is ﬁxed at w*, workers want to supply
NS
1
hours of labor, which is greater than the amount demanded by ﬁrms. At the efﬁ-
ciency wage, the quantity of labor supplied is greater than the quantity demanded,
4
so
the level of employment is determined by the labor demand of ﬁrms and hence equals
. The demand-determined level of employment is labeled because it represents the
full-employment level of employment for this model; that is, is the level of employ-
ment reached after full adjustment of wages and prices. (Note that the value of in
the efﬁciency wage model differs from the full-employment level of employment in
the classical model of the labor market, which would correspond to N
E
in Fig. 11.2.)
Because the efﬁciency wage is rigid at w*, in the absence of shocks the level of employ-
ment in this economy remains at indeﬁnitely.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Fig. 11.2 is that it provides a new expla-
nation of unemployment. It shows that, even when wages have adjusted as much
as they are going to and the economy is technically at “full employment,” an excess
supply of labor, NS
1
- , remains.
5
Why don’t the unemployed bid down the real wage and thus gain employ-
ment, as they would in the classical model of the labor market? Unlike the classical
case, in a labor market with an efﬁciency wage the real wage can’t be bid down by

The result that there is an excess supply of labor requires the assumption that the efﬁciency wage,
w*, is higher than the real wage that would clear the labor market, shown as w
E
in Fig. 11.2. We
always assume that the efﬁciency wage is higher than the market-clearing wage; if it weren’t, ﬁrms
would have to pay the market-clearing wage to attract workers.

people offering to work at lower wages because employers won’t hire them.
Employers know that people working at lower wages will not put out as much
effort per dollar of real wages as workers receiving the higher efﬁciency wage. Thus
the excess supply of labor shown in Fig. 11.2 will persist indeﬁnitely. The efﬁcien-
cy wage model thus implies that unemployment will exist even if there is no mis-
match between jobs and workers.
The efﬁciency wage model is an interesting theory of real wages and unem-
ployment. But does it explain actual behavior? ”In Touch with Data and Research:
Henry Ford’s Efﬁciency Wage,” p. 406, interprets a famous episode in labor histo-
ry in terms of efﬁciency wage theory. In addition to this anecdotal evidence, studies
of wages and employment in various ﬁrms and industries provide some support
for the efﬁciency wage model. For example, Peter Cappelli of the University of
Pennsylvania and Keith Chauvin of the University of Kansas
6
found that, consis-
tent with one aspect of the theory, plants that paid higher wages to workers
experienced less shirking, measured by the number of workers ﬁred for discipli-
nary reasons. Also, research by Michelle Alexopoulos and Jon Cohen of the
University of Toronto
7
showed that when wages became compressed in Sweden in
the 1970s, workers’ effort declined dramatically.
A criticism of the efﬁciency wage model presented here is that it predicts that
the real wage is literally ﬁxed (for no change in the effort curve). Of course, this
result is too extreme because the real wage does change over time (and over the
business cycle, as demonstrated in Chapter 8). However, the basic model can be
extended to allow for changes in the effort curve that bring changes in the efﬁ-
ciency wage over time. For example, a reasonable assumption would be that
workers are more concerned about losing their jobs during recessions, when
ﬁnding a new job is more difﬁcult, than during booms. Under this assumption,
the real wage necessary to obtain any speciﬁc level of effort will be lower during
recessions; hence the efﬁciency wage paid in recessions also may be lower. This
extension may help the efﬁciency wage model match the business cycle fact that
real wages are lower in recessions than in booms (procyclical real wages).
Efficiency Wages and the FE Line
In the Keynesian version of the IS–LM model, as in the classical version, the FE
line is vertical, at a level of output that equals the full-employment level of output,
. If we assume that employers pay efﬁciency wages, full-employment output, ,
in turn is the output produced when employment is at the full-employment level
of employment, , as shown in Fig. 11.2, and the level of worker effort is E*.
As in the classical model, anything that changes full-employment output, ,
shifts the FE line. The classical model emphasizes two factors that shift the FE line:
changes in the supply of labor and changes in productivity. In the efﬁciency wage
model, however, labor supply doesn’t affect employment, so changes in labor supply
don’t affect the FE line in the Keynesian model with efﬁciency wages. A change in

During 1908–1914 Henry Ford instituted at Ford Motor Company a radically new
way of producing automobiles.* Prior to Ford’s innovations, automobile compo-
nents weren’t produced to uniform speciﬁcations. Instead, cars had to be assembled
one by one by skilled craftsmen, who could make the parts ﬁt even if sizes or
shapes were off by fractions of an inch. Ford introduced a system of assembly-line
production in which a standardized product, the Model T automobile, was pro-
duced from precisely made, interchangeable components. The production process
also was broken into numerous small, simple steps, replacing the skilled craftsmen
who had built cars from start to ﬁnish with unskilled workers who performed
only a few operations over and over.
The high speed at which Ford ran the assembly line and the repetitiveness of
the work were hard on the workers. As one laborer said, “If I keep putting on Nut
No. 86 for about 86 more days, I will be Nut No. 86 in the Pontiac bughouse.”
†
As
a result, worker turnover was high, with the typical worker lasting only a few
months on the job. Absenteeism also was high—about 10% on any given day—and
morale was low. Worker slowdowns and even sabotage occurred.
In January 1914 Ford announced that the company would begin paying $5 a
day to workers who met certain criteria, one being that the worker had been with
the company at least six months. Five dollars a day was more than double the
normal wage for production workers at the time. Although the motivation for
Ford’s announcement has been debated, its effect was stunning: Thousands of
workers lined up outside the plant, hoping for jobs. Within the plant the number of
people quitting dropped by 87%, absenteeism dropped by 75%, and productivity
rose by 30% or more. The productivity increases helped increase Ford’s proﬁts,
despite the higher wage bill and a cut in the price of a Model T.
Many results of Ford’s $5 day can be predicted by the efﬁciency wage model,
including improved efﬁciency and higher proﬁts. As other automakers adopted
Ford’s technological innovations, they also adopted his wage policies. By 1928,
before unions were important in the industry, auto industry wages were almost
40% higher than those in the rest of manufacturing.

productivity, however, does affect the FE line in the Keynesian model, as in the
classical model. A drop in productivity reduces full-employment output, , and
shifts the FE line to the left, for two reasons. First, by reducing the marginal prod-
uct of labor at any given level of employment, a drop in productivity reduces the
demand for labor at any ﬁxed real wage. With the real wage ﬁxed at w*, the full-
employment level of employment, , falls. Second, a drop in productivity reduces
the amount of output that can be produced with any particular amount of capital,
labor, and effort.

Chapter 11 Keynesianism: The Macroeconomics of Wage and Price Rigidity 407
11.2 Price Stickiness
The rigidity created by efﬁciency wages is a real rigidity in that the real wage,
rather than the nominal wage, remains ﬁxed. Keynesian theories also emphasize
nominal rigidities that occur when a price or wage is ﬁxed in nominal, or dollar,
terms and doesn’t readily change in response to changes in supply or demand.
Keynesians often refer to rigidity of nominal prices—a tendency of prices to adjust
only slowly to changes in the economy—as price stickiness.
We explained in Section 11.1 that Keynesians introduced real-wage rigidity
because of their dissatisfaction with the classical explanation of unemployment.
Similarly, the assumption of price stickiness addresses what Keynesians believe is
another signiﬁcant weakness of the basic classical model: the classical prediction
that money is neutral.
Recall that, in the basic classical model without misperceptions, the assumption
that wages and prices adjust quickly implies that money is neutral. If money is neu-
tral, an increase or decrease in the money supply changes the price level by the
same proportion but has no effect on real variables, such as output, employment,
or the real interest rate. However, recall also that empirical studies—including
analyses of historical episodes—have led most economists to conclude that money
probably is not neutral in the real world.
One approach to accounting for monetary nonneutrality (pursued in
Chapter 10) is to extend the classical model by assuming that workers and firms
have imperfect information about the current price level (the misperceptions
theory). However, Keynesians favor an alternative explanation of monetary
nonneutrality: Prices are sticky; that is, they don’t adjust quickly. If prices are
sticky, the price level can’t adjust immediately to offset changes in the money
supply, and money isn’t neutral. Thus, for Keynesians, the importance of price
stickiness is that it helps explain monetary nonneutrality.
Although we focus on nominal-price rigidity in this section, a long Keynesian tra-
dition emphasizes nominal-wage rigidity instead of nominal-price rigidity . We discuss
an alternative version of the Keynesian model that rests on the assumption of nomi-
nal-wage rigidity in Appendix 11.A. This alternative model has similar implications to
the Keynesian model with price rigidity—in particular, that money is not neutral.
Sources of Price Stickiness: Monopolistic Competition 
and Menu Costs
To say that price stickiness gives rise to monetary nonneutrality doesn’t complete-
ly explain nonneutrality because it raises another question: Why are prices sticky?
The Keynesian explanation for the existence of price rigidity relies on two main
ideas: (1) most ﬁrms actively set the prices of their products rather than taking the
prices of their output as given by the market; and (2) when ﬁrms change prices,
they incur a cost, known as a menu cost.
Monopolistic Competition. Talking about price stickiness in a highly competitive,
organized market—such as the market for corn or the stock exchange—wouldn’t
make much sense. In these markets, prices adjust rapidly to reﬂect changes in supply
or demand. Principal reasons for price ﬂexibility in these competitive, highly
organized markets include standardization of the product being traded (one bushel
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:09 AM  Page 407
408 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
of corn of a certain grade, or one share of Microsoft stock, is much like any other) and
the large number of actual or potential market participants. These two factors make
it worthwhile to organize a centralized market (such as the New York Stock
Exchange) in which prices can react swiftly to changes in supply and demand. These
same two factors also promote keen competition among buyers and sellers, which
greatly reduces the ability of any individual to affect prices.
Most participants in the corn market or stock market think of themselves as
price takers. A price taker is a market participant who takes the market price as
given. For example, a small farmer correctly perceives that the market price of
corn is beyond his control. In contrast, a price setter has some power to set prices.
Markets having fewer participants and less standardized products than the corn
or stock markets may exhibit price-setting rather than price-taking behavior. For
example, consider the market for movies in a medium-sized city . This market may be
fairly competitive, with many different movie theaters, each trying to attract cus-
tomers from other theaters, home video stores, and so on. Although the market for
movies is competitive, it isn’t competitive to the same degree as the corn market. If a
farmer tried to raise the price of a bushel of his corn by 5¢ above the market price, he
would sell no corn; but a movie theater that raised its ticket prices by 5¢ above its
competitors’ prices wouldn’t lose all its customers. Because the movie theater’s prod-
uct isn’t completely standardized (it is showing a different movie than other theaters,
its location is better for some people, it has different candy bars in the concession
stand, a larger screen, or more comfortable seats, and so on), the theater has some
price-setting discretion. It is a price setter, not a price taker.
Generally, a situation in which all buyers and sellers are price takers (such as
the market for corn) is called perfect competition. In contrast, a situation in which
there is some competition, but in which a smaller number of sellers and imperfect
standardization of the product allow individual producers to act as price setters, is
called monopolistic competition.
Perfect competition is the model underlying the classical view of price deter-
mination, and, as we have said, price rigidity or stickiness is extremely unlikely in
a perfectly competitive market. Keynesians agree that price rigidity wouldn’t occur
in a perfectly competitive market but point out that a relatively small part of the
economy is perfectly competitive. Keynesians argue that price rigidity is possible,
even likely, in a monopolistically competitive market.
To illustrate the issues, let’s return to the example of the competing movie the-
aters. If the market for movie tickets were perfectly competitive, how would tickets
be priced? Presumably , there would be some central meeting place where buyers and
sellers of tickets would congregate. Market organizers would call out “bids” (prices
at which they are willing to buy) and “asks” (prices at which they are willing to sell).
Prices would ﬂuctuate continuously as new information hit the market, causing sup-
plies and demands to change. For example, a “two thumbs up” review by leading
movie critics would instantly drive up the price of tickets to that movie, but news of
a prospective shortage of baby-sitters would cause all movie ticket prices to fall.
Obviously, though, this scheme isn’t how movie tickets are priced. Actual pric-
ing by most theaters has the following three characteristics, which are also common
to most price-setting markets:
1. Rather than accept the price of movies as completely determined by the mar-
ket, a movie theater sets the price of tickets (or a schedule of prices), in nominal
terms, and maintains the nominal price for some period of time.
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:09 AM  Page 408
2. At least within some range, the theater meets the demand that is forthcoming at
the ﬁxed nominal price. By “meets the demand” we mean that the theater will
sell as many tickets as people want to buy at its ﬁxed price, to the point that all
its seats are ﬁlled.
3. The theater readjusts its price from time to time, generally when its costs or
the level of demand changes signiﬁcantly.
Can this type of pricing behavior maximize proﬁts? Keynesian theory sug-
gests that it can, if costs are associated with changing nominal prices, and if the
market is monopolistically competitive.
Menu Costs and Price Setting. The classic example of a cost of changing prices
is the cost that a restaurant faces when it has to reprint its menu to show changes
in the prices of its offerings. Hence the cost of changing prices is called a menu
cost. More general examples of menu costs (which can apply to any kind of ﬁrm)
include costs of remarking merchandise, reprinting price lists and catalogues, and
informing potential customers. Clearly, if ﬁrms incur costs when changing prices,
they will change prices less often than they would otherwise, which creates a
certain amount of price rigidity.
A potential problem with the menu cost explanation for price rigidity is that
these costs seem to be rather small. How, then, can they be responsible for an
amount of nominal rigidity that could have macroeconomic signiﬁcance?
Here is the ﬁrst point at which the monopolistic competition assumption is
important. For a ﬁrm in a perfectly competitive market, getting the price “a little bit
wrong” has serious consequences: The farmer who prices his corn 5¢ a bushel above
the market price sells no corn. Therefore the existence of a menu cost wouldn’t
prevent the farmer from pricing his product at precisely the correct level. However,
the demand for the output of a monopolistically competitive ﬁrm responds much
less sharply to changes in its price; the movie theater doesn’t lose many of its cus-
tomers if its ticket price is 5¢ higher than its competitors’. Thus, as long as the
monopolistic competitor’s price is in the right general range, the loss of proﬁts from
not getting the price exactly right isn’t too great. If the loss in proﬁts is less than the
cost of changing prices—the menu costs—the ﬁrm won’t change its price.
Over time, the production function and the demand curve the ﬁrm faces will
undergo a variety of shocks so that eventually the proﬁt-maximizing price for a
ﬁrm may be signiﬁcantly different from the preset price. When the proﬁts lost by
having the “wrong” price clearly exceed the cost of changing the price, the ﬁrm will
change its nominal price. Thus movie theaters periodically raise their ticket and
popcorn prices to reﬂect general inﬂation and other changes in market conditions.
Empirical Evidence on Price Stickiness. Several studies have examined the
degree of rigidity or stickiness in actual prices.
To investigate whether ﬁrms perceive their own prices as being sticky or not,
Alan Blinder
8
of Princeton University, assisted by a team of Princeton graduate stu-
dents during 1990–1992, interviewed the managers of 200 randomly selected ﬁrms
about their pricing behavior. Table 11.1 summarizes the evidence on price stickiness

by showing the percentage of ﬁrms in the study that reported changing their prices
at various frequencies. For example, the ﬁrst line of Table 11.1 tells us that 10.2% of
these ﬁrms reported changing their prices less than once per year. Almost half
(49.5%) of managers interviewed said that their ﬁrms changed prices once a year or
less. Only 22% of the ﬁrms changed prices more than four times per year.
Besides probing into pricing behavior, Blinder and his students also asked
ﬁrm managers why they tend to change prices infrequently. Direct costs of chang-
ing prices (menu costs) did appear to play a role for many ﬁrms. Nevertheless,
many managers stressed as a reason for price stickiness their concern that, if they
changed their own prices, their competitors would not necessarily follow suit.
Managers were particularly reluctant to be the ﬁrst in their market to raise prices,
fearing that they would lose customers to their rivals. For this reason, many ﬁrms
reported delaying price changes until it was evident throughout the industry that
changes in costs or demand made price adjustment necessary.
In another study of price stickiness Anil Kashyap,
9
of the University of Chicago,
examined the prices of twelve individual items listed in the catalogues of L. L.
Bean, Orvis, and Recreational Equipment, Inc., over a thirty-five-year period.
Changing the prices listed in a new catalogue is virtually costless, yet Kashyap
found that the nominal prices of many goods remained ﬁxed in successive issues of
the catalogue. When nominal prices were changed, Kashyap found both large and
small changes. He interpreted the combination of small price changes and long
periods of unchanged prices as evidence against menu costs. If menu costs are the
reason that prices aren’t changed frequently, prices should be changed only when
they are relatively far out of line, and the price changes should be large; small
changes seem to contradict this implication of menu costs. Even if menu costs
aren’t the underlying cause of pricing behavior, however, Kashyap’s study con-
ﬁrms Binder’s ﬁndings of substantial nominal-price rigidity in the economy.
However, recent evidence based on a larger data set suggests that price sticki-
ness may not be as pervasive as earlier studies indicated. In their 2004 paper, Mark
Bils of the University of Rochester and Peter Klenow of Stanford University

Chapter 11 Keynesianism: The Macroeconomics of Wage and Price Rigidity 411
found that the average time between price changes among 350 categories of goods
(whose prices were recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for use in calculating
the Consumer Price Index) was just 4.3 months, suggesting that prices are changed
much more frequently than reported by Blinder and by Kashyap. Prices of some
goods and services, such as men’s haircuts, taxicab fares, and newspapers, change
very rarely and are clearly sticky. But prices of other goods and services, including
food and gasoline, change very frequently.
The results by Bils and Klenow thus suggest that some prices are not too
sticky, and these ﬁndings could cast doubt on the price stickiness view. But one
reason that economists continue to use the assumption of price stickiness in their
models is that many of the price changes are caused by shifts in demand or
supply in a particular industry. For example, day-to-day news about the supply
of oil causes gasoline prices to change. But the assumption about price stickiness
is going to be relevant in our macroeconomic model for how prices respond to
changes in monetary policy and how prices change to restore general equilibri-
um, not how they respond to supply and demand shocks in their own industry.
Recent research by Jean Boivin of HEC-Montreal, Marc Giannoni of Columbia
University and Ilian Mihov of INSEAD
11
shows that in response to monetary
policy, prices of many goods are very sticky, whereas those same prices respond
quickly in response to shocks to supply and demand that affect the relative price
of the good compared with other goods. Thus, in our macroeconomic model,
the assumption of sticky prices is a useful one, even in the face of the Bils and
Klenow evidence.
Meeting the Demand at the Fixed Nominal Price. When prices are sticky,
ﬁrms react to changes in demand by changing the amount of production rather
than by changing prices. According to Keynesians, why are ﬁrms willing to
meet demand at a ﬁxed nominal price? To answer this question, we again rely
on the assumption of monopolistic competition. We’ve stated that a
monopolistically competitive ﬁrm can raise its price some without risk of losing
all its customers. The proﬁt-maximizing strategy for a monopolistically
competitive ﬁrm is to charge a price higher than its marginal cost, or the cost of
producing an additional unit of output. The excess of the price over the
marginal cost is the markup. For example, if a ﬁrm charges a price 15% above its
marginal cost, the ﬁrm has a markup of 15%. More generally, if the ﬁrm charges
a constant markup of η over marginal cost, the following markup rule describes
its price:
(11.1)
where P is the nominal price charged by the ﬁrm and MC is the nominal marginal
cost.
12
P = (1 + h)MC,

Review, March 2009, pp. 350–384.

Technical note: For a monopolistically competitive ﬁrm that faces a demand curve with a constant
price elasticity and a ﬁxed wage, the constant-markup rule in Eq. (11.1) will maximize proﬁt. Also, in
this case the labor demand curve is proportional to (rather than equal to) the marginal product of
labor curve. Speciﬁcally, to maximize proﬁts the ﬁrm equates the MPN to (1 +η)w*, where w* is the
efﬁciency wage, rather than equating the MPN to w* itself. This qualiﬁcation doesn’t affect any
conclusions presented in this chapter.

The effective labor
demand curve
When a ﬁrm meets the
demand for its output, it
employs just the amount
of labor needed to pro-
duce the quantity of
output demanded.
Because more labor is
required to produce
more output, ﬁrms must
employ more labor when
the demand for output is
higher. This relationship
between the amount of
output demanded and
the amount of labor
employed is the effective
labor demand curve. The
effective labor demand
curve is the same as the
production function
relating output and
labor, except that labor is
plotted on the vertical
axis and output is plot-
ted on the horizontal
axis.

Higher output implies
that more labor is needed
When the ﬁrm sets its price according to Eq. (11.1), it has an idea of how many
units it will sell. Now suppose that, to the ﬁrm’s surprise, customers demand sev-
eral more units than the ﬁrm expected to sell at that price. Will it be proﬁtable for
the ﬁrm to meet the demand at this price?
The answer is “yes.” Because the price the ﬁrm receives for each extra unit
exceeds its cost of producing that extra unit (its marginal cost), the ﬁrm’s proﬁts
increase when it sells additional units at the ﬁxed price. Thus, as long as the mar-
ginal cost remains below the ﬁxed price of its product, the ﬁrm gladly supplies
more units at this ﬁxed price. Furthermore, if the ﬁrm is paying an efﬁciency wage,
it can easily hire more workers to produce the units needed to meet the demand,
because there is an excess supply of labor.
The macroeconomic importance of ﬁrms’ meeting demand at the ﬁxed nomi-
nal price is that the economy can produce an amount of output that is not on the full-
employment line. Recall that the FE line shows the amount of output that ﬁrms
would produce after complete adjustment of all wages and prices. However, with
nominal-price stickiness the prices of goods do not adjust rapidly to their general
equilibrium values. During the period in which prices haven’t yet completely
adjusted, the amount of output produced need not be on the FE line. Instead, as
long as marginal cost is below the ﬁxed price, monopolistically competitive ﬁrms
will produce the level of output demanded.
Effective Labor Demand. When a ﬁrm meets the demand for its output at a speciﬁc
price, it may produce a different amount of output and employ a different amount of
labor than it had planned. How much labor will a ﬁrm actually employ when it meets
the demand? The answer is given by the effective labor demand curve, ND
e
(Y),
shown in Fig. 11.3. For any amount of output, Y, the effective labor demand curve
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:09 AM  Page 412
Chapter 11 Keynesianism: The Macroeconomics of Wage and Price Rigidity 413
indicates how much labor is needed to produce that output, with productivity, the
capital stock, and effort held constant.
We already have a concept that expresses the relationship between the amount
of labor used and the amount of output produced: the production function. Indeed,
the effective labor demand curve in Fig. 11.3 is simply a graph of the production
function relating output and labor input, except that output, Y, is measured on the
horizontal axis and labor, N, is measured on the vertical axis. (This reversal of the
axes is convenient later.) The effective labor demand curve slopes upward from left
to right because a ﬁrm needs more labor to produce more output.
We use the effective labor demand curve to determine the level of employment
in the Keynesian model in Section 11.3. When the economy is not on the FE line and
the price level is ﬁxed, the effective labor demand curve gives the level of employ-
ment. Then, after complete adjustment of wages and prices, the economy returns to
the FE line and the level of employment is given by the labor demand curve, ND*
(Fig. 11.2). After wages and prices have completely adjusted, with output at its full-
employment level, , the effective labor demand curve indicates that employment
equals , as shown in Fig. 11.3.
11.3 Monetary and Fiscal Policy in the Keynesian Model
Let’s now consider the complete Keynesian model. Like the classical model, the
Keynesian model can be expressed in terms of the IS–LM diagram or, alternative-
ly, in terms of the AD–AS diagram. Rather than describe the Keynesian model in
the abstract, we put it to work analyzing the effects of monetary and ﬁscal policy.
Monetary Policy
The main reason for introducing nominal-price stickiness into the Keynesian model
was to explain monetary nonneutrality. We examine the link between price sticki-
ness and monetary nonneutrality ﬁrst in the Keynesian IS–LM framework and
then in the Keynesian version of the AD–AS model.
Monetary Policy in the Keynesian IS–LM Model. The Keynesian version of the
IS–LM model is quite similar to the IS–LM model discussed in Chapters 9 and 10.
In particular, the IS curve and the LM curve are the same as in our earlier analyses.
The FE line in the Keynesian model also is similar to the FE line used earlier. The
Keynesian FE line is vertical at the full-employment level of output, , which in
turn depends on the full-employment level of employment determined in the
labor market. However, the Keynesian and classical FE lines differ in two respects.
First, in the Keynesian model the full-employment level of employment is
determined at the intersection of the labor demand curve and the efﬁciency wage
line, not at the point where the quantities of labor demanded and supplied are
equal, as in the classical model. Second, because labor supply doesn’t affect
employment in the efﬁciency wage model, changes in labor supply don’t affect the
Keynesian FE line, although changes in labor supply do affect the classical FE line.
Because of price stickiness, in the Keynesian model the economy doesn’t have
to be in general equilibrium in the short run. However, in the long run when prices
adjust, the economy reaches its general equilibrium at the intersection of the IS
curve, the LM curve, and the FE line, as in the classical model.

414 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
According to Keynesians, what happens to the economy in the short run, if
sticky prices prevent it from reaching general equilibrium? Keynesians assume
that the asset market clears quickly and that the level of output is determined by
aggregate demand. Thus, according to Keynesians, the economy always lies at the
intersection of the IS and LM curves. However, because monopolistically competitive
ﬁrms are willing to meet the demand for goods at ﬁxed levels of prices, output can
differ from full-employment output and the economy may not be on the FE line in
the short run. When the economy is off the FE line, ﬁrms use just enough labor to
produce the output needed to meet demand. Under the assumption that the efﬁ-
ciency wage is higher than the market-clearing real wage, there are always unem-
ployed workers who want to work, and ﬁrms are able to change employment as
needed to meet the demand for output without changing the wage.
Figure 11.4 analyzes the effect of an increase in the nominal money supply in
the Keynesian IS–LM model. We assume that the economy starts at its general
equilibrium point, E. Recall that an increase in the money supply shifts the LM
curve down and to the right, from LM
1
to LM
2
(Fig. 11.4a). Because an increase in
the money supply doesn’t directly affect the goods or labor markets, the IS curve
and the FE line are unaffected. So far this analysis is like that of the classical model.
Unlike the classical model, however, the Keynesian model is based on the
assumption that prices are temporarily ﬁxed (because of menu costs) so that the
general equilibrium at E isn’t restored immediately. Instead, the short-run equilib-
rium of the economy—that is, the resting point of the economy at the ﬁxed price
level—lies at the intersection of IS and LM
2
(point F), where output rises to Y
2
and
the real interest rate falls to r
2
.
Because the IS–LM intersection at point F is to the right of the FE line, aggregate
output demanded, Y
2
, is greater than the full-employment level of output, .
Monopolistically competitive ﬁrms facing menu costs don’t raise their prices in the
short run, as competitive ﬁrms do. Instead they increase production to Y
2
to satis-
fy the higher level of demand. To increase production, ﬁrms raise employment—for
example, by hiring additional workers or by having employees work overtime. The
level of employment is given by the effective labor demand curve in Fig. 11.4(b).
Because the level of output increases from to Y
2
in the short run, the level of
employment increases from to N
2
.
We refer to a monetary policy that shifts the LM curve down and to the right—
and thus increases output and employment—as an expansionary monetary policy,
or “easy” money. Analogously, a contractionary monetary policy, or “tight” money,
is a decrease in the money supply that shifts the LM curve up and to the left,
decreasing output and employment.
Why does easy money increase output in the Keynesian model? In the Keyne-
sian model, prices are ﬁxed in the short run, so an increase in the nominal money
supply, M, also is an increase in the real money supply, M/P. Recall that, for hold-
ers of wealth to be willing to hold more real money, and a correspondingly smaller
amount of nonmonetary assets, the real interest rate must fall.
13
Finally, the lower
real interest rate increases both consumption spending (because saving falls) and
investment spending. With more demand for their output, firms increase
production and employment, taking the economy to point F in Fig. 11.4.

As discussed in Chapter 9, the real interest rate is driven down by wealth-holders’ attempts to
exchange money for nonmonetary assets. The purchase of nonmonetary assets drives up their prices,
which is the same as decreasing the real interest rate that they pay.

the IS curve and the FE

Because prices are ﬁxed

The rigidity of the price level isn’t permanent. Eventually, ﬁrms will review and
readjust their prices, allowing the economy to reach its long-run equilibrium. In the
case of monetary expansion, ﬁrms ﬁnd that demand for their products in the short run
is greater than they had planned (aggregate output demanded, Y
2
, is greater than full-
employment output, ), so eventually they raise their prices. The rise in the price level
returns the real money supply to its initial level, which shifts the LM curve back to
LM
1
and restores the general equilibrium at point E in Fig. 11.4(a). This adjustment
process is exactly the same as in the classical model, but it proceeds more slowly.
Thus, the Keynesian model predicts that money is not neutral in the short run but is
neutral in the long run. In this respect the predictions of the Keynesian model are the
Y

416 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
same as those of the extended classical model with misperceptions. In the Keynesian
model, short-run price stickiness prevents the economy from reaching its general
equilibrium, but in the long run prices are ﬂexible, ensuring general equilibrium.
Monetary Policy in the Keynesian AD–AS Model. We can also analyze the effect
of monetary policy on real output and the price level by using the Keynesian
version of the AD–AS model. In fact, we have already performed this analysis in
Fig. 9.14, where we used the AD–AS model to examine the effects of a 10%
increase in the nominal money supply. Although we didn’t identify that analysis
as speciﬁcally Keynesian or classical, it can be readily given a Keynesian
interpretation.
The distinguishing feature that determines whether an analysis is Keynesian or
classical is the speed of price adjustment. As we emphasized in Chapter 10, classi-
cal economists argue that prices adjust quickly so that the economy reaches its
long-run equilibrium quickly. In the extreme version of the classical model, the
long-run equilibrium is reached virtually immediately, and the short-run aggregate
supply (SRAS) curve is irrelevant. However, in the Keynesian model, monopolis-
tically competitive ﬁrms that face menu costs keep their prices ﬁxed for a while,
producing the amount of output demanded at the ﬁxed price level. This behavior
is represented by a horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve such as SRAS
1
in
Fig. 9.14. If we assume that firms maintain fixed prices and simply meet the
demand for output for a substantial period of time, so that the departure from long-
run equilibrium lasts for months or perhaps even years, the analysis illustrated in
Fig. 9.14 reﬂects the Keynesian approach.
Let’s brieﬂy review that analysis from an explicitly Keynesian perspective.
Figure 9.14 depicts the effects of a 10% increase in the nominal money supply on an
economy that is initially in both short-run and long-run equilibrium (at point E).
The increase in the nominal money supply causes the AD curve to shift up from
AD
1
to AD
2
. In fact, as we explained in Chapter 9, the 10% increase in the nominal
money supply shifts the AD curve up by 10% at each level of output. The initial
effect of this shift in the AD curve is to move the economy to a short-run equilibri-
um at point F, where output is higher than its full-employment level, . Because of
menu costs, ﬁrms don’t immediately react to increased demand by raising prices,
but instead increase production to meet the higher demand. Thus, at point F, ﬁrms
are producing more output than the amount that would maximize their proﬁts in
the absence of menu costs. Because output is temporarily higher than its full-
employment level, we conclude that in the Keynesian model money isn’t neutral in
the short run. Eventually, however, ﬁrms will increase their prices to bring the
quantity of output demanded back to the proﬁt-maximizing level of output. In the
long-run equilibrium, represented by point H in Fig. 9.14, output equals the full-
employment level, , and the price level, P
2
, is 10% higher than the initial price
level, P
1
. In long-run equilibrium the expansion of the money supply affects only
nominal quantities, such as the price level, not real quantities, such as output or
employment, so we conclude that in the Keynesian model (as in the classical
model) money is neutral in the long run.
Fiscal Policy
The Keynesian model was initially developed during the Great Depression as econ-
omists struggled to explain the worldwide economic collapse and ﬁnd policies to

help the economy return to normal. The early Keynesians stressed that fiscal
policy—the government’s decisions about government purchases and taxes—can
signiﬁcantly affect output and employment levels. Let’s look at the Keynesians’
conclusion that both increased government purchases and lower taxes can be used
to raise output and employment.
The Effect of Increased Government Purchases. The Keynesian analysis of
how increased government purchases affect the economy is shown in Fig. 11.5.
Again, we assume that the economy starts from full employment (later we discuss
what happens if the economy starts from a recession). Point E represents the
initial equilibrium in both (a) and (b). As before, a temporary increase in
government purchases increases the demand for goods and reduces desired
national saving at any level of the real interest rate, so that the IS curve shifts up
and to the right, from IS
1
to IS
2
(see Summary table 12, p. 315). In the short run,
before prices can adjust, the economy moves to point F in Fig. 11.5(a), where the
new IS curve, IS
2
, and LM
1
intersect. At F both output and the real interest rate
have increased. Because ﬁrms meet the higher demand at the ﬁxed price level,
employment also rises, as shown by the movement from point E to point F along
the effective labor demand curve in Fig. 11.5(b). A ﬁscal policy change, such as
this one, that shifts the IS curve up and to the right and raises output and
employment is an expansionary change. Similarly, a ﬁscal policy change (such as
a reduction in government purchases) that shifts the IS curve down and to the left
and reduces output and employment is a contractionary change.
In discussing the effects of increased government purchases or other types of
spending, Keynesians often use the multiplier concept. The multiplier associated
with any particular type of spending is the short-run change in total output result-
ing from a one-unit change in that type of spending. So, for example, if the increase
in government purchases analyzed in Fig. 11.5 is ΔG and the resulting short-run
increase in output between points E and F in Fig. 11.5 is ΔY, the multiplier associ-
ated with government purchases is ΔY /ΔG. Keynesians usually argue that the
fiscal policy multiplier is greater than 1, so that if government purchases rise
by $1 billion, output will rise by more than $1 billion. We derive an algebraic
expression for the government purchases multiplier in Appendix 11.C.
Recall that the classical version of the IS–LM model also predicts that a tem-
porary increase in government purchases increases output, but in a different way.
The classical analysis focuses on the fact that increased government purchases
require higher current or future taxes to pay for the extra spending. Higher taxes
make workers (who are taxpayers) effectively poorer, which induces them to
supply more labor. This increase in labor supply shifts the FE line to the right and
causes output to rise in the classical model. In contrast, the FE line in the Keynesian
model doesn’t depend on labor supply (because of efﬁciency wages) and thus is
unaffected by the increase in government purchases. Instead, the increase in gov-
ernment purchases affects output by raising aggregate demand (that is, by shifting
the IS–LM intersection to the right). Output increases above its full-employment
level in the short run as ﬁrms satisfy extra demand at the initial price level.
The effect of increased government purchases on output in the Keynesian
model lasts only as long as needed for the price level to adjust. (However, many
Keynesians believe that price adjustment is sufﬁciently slow that this effect could
be felt for several years.) In the long run, when ﬁrms adjust their prices, the LM
curve moves up and to the left, from LM
1
to LM
2
in Fig. 11.5(a), and the economy
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:09 AM  Page 417
418 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
reaches general equilibrium at point H, with output again at . Thus an increase in
government purchases doesn’t raise output in the long run.
The effects of more government purchases also appear in the Keynesian
AD–AS framework (Fig. 11.6). Increased government purchases shift the IS curve
up and to the right and raise the aggregate demand for output at any given price
level. Thus, as a result of expansionary ﬁscal policy, the aggregate demand curve
shifts to the right, from AD
1
to AD
2
. The increase in aggregate demand raises
output above , as shown by the shift from the initial equilibrium at point E to the
short-run equilibrium at point F. At F the aggregate demand for output is greater
than full-employment output, so ﬁrms eventually raise their prices. In the long run

The Effect of Lower Taxes. Keynesians generally believe that, like an increase in
government purchases, a lump-sum reduction in current taxes is expansionary. In
other words, they expect that a tax cut will shift the IS curve up and to the right,
raising output and employment in the short run. Similarly, they expect a tax
increase to be contractionary, shifting the IS curve down and to the left.
Why does a tax cut affect the IS curve, according to Keynesians? The argument
is that if consumers receive a tax cut, they will spend part of it on increased con-
sumption. For any output, Y, and level of government purchases, G, an increase in
desired consumption arising from a tax cut will lower desired national saving, 
Y-C
d
-G. A drop in desired saving raises the real interest rate that clears the goods
market and shifts the IS curve up.
14
If a tax cut raises desired consumption and shifts the IS curve up, as Keyne-
sians claim, the effects on the economy are similar to the effects of increased gov-
ernment purchases (Figs. 11.5 and 11.6). In the short run, a tax cut raises aggregate
demand and thus output and employment at the initial price level. In the long run,
after complete price adjustment, the economy returns to full employment with a
higher real interest rate than in the initial general equilibrium. The only difference

In arguing that a tax cut raises desired consumption and lowers desired national saving, Keynesian
economists reject the Ricardian equivalence proposition (Chapter 4), which states that a lump-sum tax
cut should not affect consumption or national saving. We discuss Ricardian equivalence further in
Chapter 15.

420 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
between the tax cut and the increase in government purchases is that, instead of
raising the portion of full-employment output devoted to government purchases,
a tax cut raises the portion of full-employment output devoted to consumption.
11.4 The Keynesian Theory of Business Cycles 
and Macroeconomic Stabilization
Recall that there are two basic questions about business cycles that a macroeco-
nomic theory should try to answer: (1) What causes recurrent ﬂuctuations in the
economy? and (2) What, if anything, should policymakers try to do about cycles?
We are now ready to give the Keynesian answers to these two questions.
Keynesian Business Cycle Theory
An explanation of the business cycle requires not only a macroeconomic model but
also some assumptions about the types of shocks hitting the economy. For example,
RBC economists believe that productivity shocks, which directly shift the FE line,
are the most important type of macroeconomic shock.
In contrast to RBC economists, most Keynesians believe that aggregate demand
shocks are the primary source of business cycle ﬂuctuations. Aggregate demand
shocks are shocks to the economy that shift either the IS curve or the LM curve and
thus affect the aggregate demand for output. Examples of aggregate demand
shocks affecting the IS curve are changes in ﬁscal policy, changes in desired invest-
ment arising from changes in the expected future marginal product of capital,
15
and
changes in consumer conﬁdence about the future that affect desired saving. Exam-
ples of aggregate demand shocks affecting the LM curve are changes in the demand
for money or changes in the money supply. The Keynesian version of the IS–LM
model, combined with the view that most shocks are aggregate demand shocks,
constitutes the Keynesian theory of business cycles.
Figure 11.7 uses the Keynesian model to illustrate a recession caused by an
aggregate demand shock. Suppose that consumers become pessimistic about the
long-term future of the economy and thus reduce their current desired consump-
tion; equivalently, they raise their current desired saving. For any level of income,
an increase in desired saving lowers the real interest rate that clears the goods
market and thus shifts the IS curve down, from IS
1
to IS
2
. The economy goes into
recession at point F, and, as prices don’t adjust immediately to restore full employ-
ment, it remains in recession for some period of time with output below its full-
employment level. Because ﬁrms face below-normal levels of demand, they also cut
employment.
Note that a decline in investment spending (reﬂecting, for example, pessimism
of business investors) or reduced government purchases would have similar reces-
sionary effects as the decline in consumer spending analyzed in Fig. 11.7. Alterna-
tively, a shift up and to the left of the LM curve (because of either increased money
demand or reduced money supply) also could cause a recession in the Keynesian
15
A change in the expected future MPK might also be thought of as a technological shock because it
involves a change in the future production function. However, because a change in the future MPK
shifts the IS curve but doesn’t affect the current FE line, Keynesians classify it as an aggregate
demand shock.

framework; in this case, high real interest rates caused by the “shortage” of money
would cause the declines in consumer spending and investment. Thus Keynesians
attribute recessions to “not enough demand” for goods, in contrast to classical
economists who attribute recessions to “not enough supply.”
Like the real business cycle theory , the Keynesian theory of cycles can account for
several of the business cycle facts: (1) in response to occasional aggregate demand
shocks, the theory predicts recurrent ﬂuctuations in output; (2) the theory correctly
implies that employment will fluctuate in the same direction as output; and
(3) because it predicts that shocks to the money supply will be nonneutral, the theory
is consistent with the business cycle fact that money is procyclical and leading.
A business cycle fact that we previously emphasized (Chapter 8) is that spend-
ing on investment goods and other durable goods is strongly procyclical and
volatile. This cyclical behavior of durable goods spending can be explained by the
Keynesian theory if shocks to durable goods demand are themselves a main source
of cycles. The demand for durable goods would be a source of cyclical ﬂuctuations
if, for example, investors frequently reassessed their expectations of the future
MPK. Keynes himself thought that waves of investor optimism and pessimism,
which he called “animal spirits,” were a signiﬁcant source of cyclical ﬂuctuations.
A rise in the demand for investment goods or consumer durables (at ﬁxed levels of
output and the real interest rate) is expansionary because it shifts the IS curve up
and to the right. Investment will also be procyclical in the Keynesian model when-
ever cycles are caused by ﬂuctuations in the LM curve; for example, an increase in
the money supply that shifts the LM curve down and to the right both increases
output and (by reducing the real interest rate) increases investment.
Another important business cycle fact that is consistent with the Keynesian
theory is the observation that inﬂation tends to slow during or just after recessions
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:10 AM  Page 421
422 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
(inﬂation is procyclical and lagging). In the Keynesian view, as Fig. 11.7 illustrates,
during a recession, aggregate output demanded is less than the full-employment
level of output. Thus, when ﬁrms do adjust their prices, they will be likely to cut
them to increase their sales. According to the Keynesian model, because demand
pressure is low during recessions, inﬂation will tend to subside when the economy
is weak.
Procyclical Labor Productivity and Labor Hoarding. Although the Keynesian
model is consistent with many of the business cycle facts, one fact—that labor
productivity is procyclical—presents problems for this approach. Recall that
procyclical labor productivity is consistent with the real business cycle
assumption that cycles are caused by productivity shocks—that recessions are
times when productivity is unusually low and booms are times when
productivity is unusually high. Unlike the RBC economists, however, Keynesians
assume that demand shocks rather than supply (productivity) shocks cause most
cyclical ﬂuctuations.
Because supply shocks are shifts of the production function, the Keynesian
assumption that supply shocks usually are unimportant is the same as saying that
the production function is fairly stable over the business cycle. But if the production
function is stable, increases in employment during booms should reduce average
labor productivity because of the diminishing marginal productivity of labor. Thus
the Keynesian model predicts that average labor productivity is countercyclical,
contrary to the business cycle fact.
To explain the procyclical behavior of average labor productivity, Keynesians
have modiﬁed their models to include labor hoarding. As discussed in Section
10.1, labor hoarding occurs if ﬁrms retain, or “hoard,” labor in a recession rather
than laying off or ﬁring workers. The reason that ﬁrms might hoard labor during a
recession is to avoid the costs of letting workers go and then having to rehire them
or hire and train new workers when the recession ends. Thus hoarded labor may be
used less intensively (for example, store clerks may wait on fewer customers in a
day) or be assigned to activities such as painting, cleaning, maintaining equip-
ment, and training. If labor is utilized less intensively during a recession, or work-
ers spend time on activities such as maintenance that don’t directly contribute to
measured output, labor productivity may fall during a recession even though the
production function is stable. Thus labor hoarding provides a way of explaining the
procyclical behavior of average labor productivity without assuming that reces-
sions and expansions are caused by productivity shocks.
Macroeconomic Stabilization
From the Keynesian explanation of why business cycles occur, we turn to the Key-
nesian view on how policymakers should respond to recessions and booms. Brieﬂy,
Keynesians—unlike classical economists—generally favor policy actions to “stabi-
lize” the economy by eliminating large ﬂuctuations in output and employment.
Keynesian support of more active policy measures follows from the theory’s char-
acterization of business cycle expansions and contractions as periods in which the
economy is temporarily away from its general equilibrium (or not at the IS–LM–FE
intersection). According to Keynesians, recessions are particularly undesirable
because in a recession, employment may be far below the amount of labor that

Stabilization policy in

From point E the econo-
my is driven into a reces-
sion at point F by a drop
in consumer conﬁdence
and spending, which

. If the
government took no
action, in the long run
price adjustment would
shift the LM curve from
LM

to LM

and restore
general equilibrium at
point H (Scenario 1).
Alternatively, the
government could try to
offset the recession
through stabilization
policy. For example, the
Fed could increase the
money supply, which
would shift the LM curve
directly from LM

speeding the recovery in

is a ﬁscal expansion,
such as an increase in

which would shift the IS

employment at E (Sce-
nario 3).

egy of doing nothing,

workers want to supply, which leads to hardships for the unemployed and to
output that is “too low.” Keynesians therefore argue that average economic well-
being would be increased if governments tried to reduce cyclical ﬂuctuations, espe-
cially recessions.
The Keynesian analysis of monetary and ﬁscal policies suggests that these
policies could be used to smooth the business cycle. To understand how, consider
Fig. 11.8. Suppose that the economy, initially in general equilibrium at point E, has
been driven into recession at point F. Various types of shocks could have caused
this recession. In Fig. 11.7, for example, we considered a drop in consumer conﬁ-
dence about the future of the economy. A drop in conﬁdence would reduce current
desired consumption and increase current desired saving, thereby shifting the IS
curve down from IS
1
to IS
2
. This sort of change in consumer attitudes may have
contributed to the 1990–1991 recession.
How might policymakers respond to this recession? We consider three possible
scenarios: (1) no change in monetary or ﬁscal policy; (2) an increase in the money
supply; and (3) an increase in government purchases.
■ Scenario 1: No change in macroeconomic policy. One policy option is to do noth-
ing. With no government intervention, the economy eventually will correct
itself. At point F in Fig. 11.8, aggregate output demanded is below the full-
employment level of output . Therefore, over time, prices will begin to fall,
increasing the real money supply and shifting the LM curve down and to the
right. In the long run, price declines shift the LM curve from LM
1
to LM
2
,
restoring the economy to general equilibrium at point H. However, a disad-
vantage of this strategy is that, during the (possibly lengthy) price adjustment
process, output and employment remain below their full-employment levels.

424 Part 3 Business Cycles and Macroeconomic Policy
■ Scenario 2: An increase in the money supply. Instead of waiting for the economy
to reach general equilibrium through price adjustment, the Fed could increase
the money supply, which also would shift the LM curve from LM
1
to LM
2
in
Fig. 11.8. If prices adjust slowly, this expansionary policy would move the
economy to general equilibrium at point H more quickly than would doing
nothing.
■ Scenario 3: An increase in government purchases. An alternative policy of raising
government purchases will shift the IS curve up and to the right, from IS
2
to
IS
1
. This policy also takes the economy to full employment, although at point
E in Fig. 11.8 rather than at point H.
In all three scenarios, the economy eventually returns to full employment.
However, the use of monetary or ﬁscal policy to achieve full employment leads to
two important differences from the scenario in which no policy action is taken.
First, if the government uses monetary or ﬁscal expansion to end the recession, the
economy returns directly to full employment; if policy isn’t changed, the economy
remains in recession in the short run, returning to full employment only when
prices have fully adjusted. Second, if there is no policy change (Scenario 1), in the
long run the price level falls relative to the nominal money supply. Indeed, the drop
in the price level relative to the money supply increases the real money supply,
shifts the LM curve down and to the right, and restores full employment at point H.
In contrast, when monetary or ﬁscal policy is used to restore full employment (Sce-
narios 2 and 3), the downward adjustment of the price level doesn’t occur because
expansionary policy directly returns aggregate demand to the full-employment
level. Thus, according to the Keynesian analysis, using expansionary monetary or
ﬁscal policy has the advantage of bringing the economy back to full employment
more quickly but the disadvantage of leading to a higher price level than if no
policy action is undertaken.
Usually, either monetary or ﬁscal policy can be used to bring the economy
back to full employment. Does it matter which policy is used? Yes, there is at least
one basic difference between the outcomes of the two policies: Monetary and ﬁscal
policies affect the composition of spending (the amount of output that is devoted
to consumption, the amount to investment, and so on) differently. In Fig. 11.8,
although total output is the same at the alternative general equilibrium points E
and H, at E (reached by an increase in government purchases) government pur-
chases are higher than at H (reached by an increase in the money supply). Because
government purchases are higher at E, the remaining components of spending—in
a closed economy, consumption and investment—must be lower at E than at H.
Relative to a monetary expansion, an increase in government purchases crowds out
consumption and investment by raising the real interest rate, which is higher at E
than at H. In addition, increased government purchases imply higher current or
future tax burdens, which also reduces consumption relative to what it would be
with monetary expansion.
Difficulties of Macroeconomic Stabilization. The use of monetary and ﬁscal
policies to smooth or moderate the business cycle is called macroeconomic
stabilization. Using macroeconomic policies to try to smooth the cycle is also
sometimes called aggregate demand management because monetary and ﬁscal
policies shift the aggregate demand curve. Macroeconomic stabilization was a

Chapter 11 Keynesianism: The Macroeconomics of Wage and Price Rigidity 425
popular concept in the heyday of Keynesian economics in the 1960s, and it still
inﬂuences policy discussions. Unfortunately, even putting aside the debates
between classicals and Keynesians about whether smoothing the business cycle is
desirable, actual macroeconomic stabilization has been much less successful than
the simple Keynesian theory suggests.
As discussed earlier in connection with ﬁscal policy (Section 10.1), attempts to
stabilize the economy run into some technical problems. First, because the ability
to measure and analyze the economy is imperfect, gauging how far the economy is
from full employment at any particular time is difﬁcult. Second, the amount that
output will increase in response to a monetary or ﬁscal expansion isn’t known
exactly. These uncertainties make assessing how much of a monetary or ﬁscal
change is needed to restore full employment difﬁcult. Finally, even knowing the
size of the policy change needed still wouldn’t provide enough information.
Because macroeconomic policies take time to implement and more time to affect
the economy, their optimal use requires knowledge of where the economy will be
six months or a year from now. But such knowledge is, at best, very imprecise.
Because of these problems, aggregate demand management has been likened
to trying to hit a moving target in a heavy fog. These problems haven’t persuaded
most Keynesians to abandon stabilization policy; however, many Keynesians agree
that policymakers should concentrate on ﬁghting major recessions and not try to
fine-tune the economy by smoothing every bump and wiggle in output and
employment.
Supply Shocks in the Keynesian Model
Until the 1970s, the Keynesian business cycle theory focused almost exclusively on
aggregate demand shocks as the source of business cycle ﬂuctuations. Because
aggregate demand shocks lead to procyclical movements in inﬂation, however, the
Keynesian theory failed to account for the stagﬂation—high inﬂation together with
a recession—that hit the U.S. economy following the 1973–1975 oil price shock.
This experience led to much criticism of the traditional theory by both econo-
mists and policymakers, so Keynesians recast the theory to allow for both supply
and demand shocks. Although Keynesians wouldn’t go so far as to agree with
RBC economists that supply (productivity) shocks are a factor in most recessions,
they now concede that there have been occasional episodes—the oil price shocks
of the 1970s being the leading examples—in which supply shocks have played a
primary role in an economic downturn. (See ”In Touch with Data and Research:
DSGE Models and the Classical–Keynesian Debate,” p. 427, for further discussion
of agreement and disagreement between Keynesians and classicals.)
Figure 11.9 shows a Keynesian analysis of the effects of a sharp temporary
increase in the price of oil (a similar analysis would apply to other supply shocks,
such as a drought). As we showed in Chapter 3, if ﬁrms respond to an increase in
the price of oil by using less energy, the amount of output that can be produced
with the same amount of capital and labor falls. Thus the increase in the price of oil
is an adverse supply shock, which reduces the full-employment level of output and
shifts the FE line to the left, from FE
1
to FE
2
. After complete wage and price adjust-
ment, which occurs virtually immediately in the basic classical model but only in
the long run in the Keynesian model, output falls to its new full-employment level,
. Thus, in the long run (after full wage and price adjustment), the Keynesian
analysis and the classical analysis of a supply shock are the same.

An oil price shock in
the Keynesian model
An increase in the price
of oil is an adverse
supply shock that
reduces full-employment
output from to and
thus shifts the FE line to
the left. In addition, the
increase in the price of
oil increases prices in
sectors that depend
heavily on oil, whereas
prices in other sectors
remain ﬁxed in the short
run. Thus the average
price level rises, which
reduces the real money
supply, M/ P, and shifts
the LM curve up and to
the left, from LM
1
to
LM
2
. In the short run, the
economy moves to point
F, with output falling
below the new, lower
value of full-employment
output and the real inter-
est rate increasing.
Because the aggregate
quantity of goods
demanded at F is less
than the full-
employment level of
output, , in the long
run the price level falls,
partially offsetting the
initial increase in prices.
The drop in the price
level causes the LM
curve to shift down and
to the right, from LM

to
LM

, moving the econo-
my to full-employment
equilibrium at point H.

However, the Keynesian analysis of the short-run effects of an oil price shock
is slightly different from the classical analysis. To understand the short-term effects
of the oil price shock in the Keynesian model, ﬁrst think about the effects of the
increase in the oil price on the general price level. Recall that ﬁrms facing menu
costs will not change their prices if the “right” prices are only a little different from
the preset prices. However, if the right prices are substantially different from the
preset prices, so that ﬁrms would lose considerable proﬁts by maintaining the
preset prices, they will change their prices. In the case of a large increase in the price
of oil, ﬁrms whose costs are strongly affected by the price of oil—including gas sta-
tions, suppliers of home heating oil, and airlines, for example—ﬁnd that the right
prices for their products are substantially higher than the preset prices. These oil-
dependent ﬁrms increase their prices quickly, whereas ﬁrms in other sectors main-
tain their preset prices in the short run. Thus there is price stickiness in the sense
that not all prices adjust to their equilibrium values, and yet the average price
level rises in the short run.
Because a sharp increase in the price of oil raises the price level, P, in the short
run, it also reduces the real money supply, M/ P. A decline in the real money supply
shifts the LM curve up and to the left, from LM
1
to LM
2
in Fig. 11.9. As drawn, the
intersection of the LM curve and the IS curve is located to the left of the new FE
line, although this outcome isn’t logically necessary. The short-run equilibrium is at
point F, where LM
2
intersects the IS curve. Because F is to the left of the FE line, the
economy is in a recession at F, with output (at Y
3
) below the new value of full-
employment output, . In the short run, the economy experiences stagﬂation,
with both a drop in output and a burst of inflation. Note that, according to
this analysis, the short-run decline in output has two components: (1) the drop 
in full-employment output from to ; and (2) the drop in output below the new Y

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
DSGE Models and the Classical–Keynesian Debate
In Chapters 10 and 11, we have compared and contrasted the classical and Keyne-
sian approaches to analyzing the business cycle and to determining stabilization
policy. For many years, classical and Keynesian economists pursued research on
business cycles and stabilization policy using very different types of models, and
they argued about the data using very different empirical methods. As a result,
communication between the two groups was difﬁcult.
However, in the past decade, some classical economists have been incorporating
Keynesian ideas into their models, and some Keynesian economists have been incor-
porating classical ideas into their models. Many young economists coming from top
Ph.D. programs have been well trained in dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium
(DSGE) models, which we discussed brieﬂy in Chapter 10. Roughly speaking, those
models use techniques that were developed by classical RBC economists in the 1980s
and 1990s, so many Keynesian economists have adopted classical methods of analy-
sis. But many of the models, even those used by classical economists, incorporate
Keynesian features, especially sticky prices (but not usually efﬁciency wages) and
imperfect competition among ﬁrms. As a result, classical and Keynesian economists
are now speaking the same language and can communicate with each other more
clearly, and research on macroeconomic ideas is advancing more easily.
One fundamental area of difference between classical and Keynesian economists
had always been the degree to which a model incorporated microeconomic founda-
tions. Many classical economists, especially after ideas about rational expectations
came to the forefront in the early 1980s, believed that good models could be developed
only by modeling microeconomic foundations, which means showing how house-
holds choose labor supply and consumption spending to maximize their own welfare,
how ﬁrms chose labor demand and investment spending to maximize their own
proﬁts, and so on. Keynesian economists, however, often believed that the attempt to
ﬁnd microeconomic foundations was unlikely to be fruitful, and instead they focused
on large-scale macroeconomic models that were based on demand curves and supply
curves of aggregates rather than worrying about individual decision making. The
result was that classical economists thought Keynesian models were both wrong and
worthless, and Keynesians thought the same of classical models. After decades of
ﬁghting over the right type of modeling to perform (some of which continues), some
researchers found ways to reconcile the two approaches.* The basic idea was to
show under what circumstances the Keynesian-type model with a few equations
describing behavior was consistent with a classical model containing detailed micro-
economic foundations. This research helped to reconcile the classical and Keynesian
approaches, even though it did not convince everyone on both sides.
However, despite the gains that have been made in the past decade, classicals
and Keynesians still differ in some fundamental ways. Keynesians tend to believe
that prices and wages are slow to adjust, while classicals think they adjust faster. Key-
nesians tend to have more faith that government policy actions can improve people’s
welfare, while classical economists often think just the opposite—that many gov-
ernment policies make people worse off, especially when it comes to attempts to sta-
bilize the business cycle. But at least the two sides now are speaking to each other.

(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2003).

full-employment level arising from the shift up and to the left of the LM curve (the
difference between and ).
Supply shocks of the type analyzed in Fig. 11.9 pose tremendous difﬁculties for
Keynesian stabilization policies. First, monetary or ﬁscal policy can do little about
the portion of the decline in output resulting from the shift of the FE line; attempts
to expand the economy beyond the new full-employment output level, , will
increase output only temporarily and worsen inﬂation. In contrast, the portion of
the output decline arising from the shift up and to the left of the LM curve (the dif-
ference between and ) represents an output level below the full-employment
level and could, in principle, be eliminated by expansionary monetary or ﬁscal poli-
cies that raise output to . However, by using expansionary policies at point F,
rather than doing nothing, the government risks worsening the already-high rate
of inﬂation. Hence, in the face of a shock that induces stagﬂation like the one
shown in Fig. 11.9, macroeconomic policy can neither avoid a sharp decline in
output nor restore output even to its new, lower full-employment level without
potentially worsening inﬂation.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. Keynesians are skeptical that a mismatch between
workers and jobs can explain all unemployment.
They argue that some unemployment is caused by
real wages that are rigid and above the level at which
the quantities of labor demanded and supplied are
equal.
2. One explanation for real-wage rigidity is based on
the efﬁciency wage model, which assumes that work-
ers work harder in response to an increase in the real
wage. Firms can attain the highest level of proﬁt by
paying the real wage, known as the efﬁciency wage,
that elicits the most worker effort per dollar of wages.
If the effort curve relating effort provided by workers
to the real wage doesn’t change, the efﬁciency wage,
and hence the real wage actually paid, is rigid.
3. At the efficiency wage, firms demand the level of
employment, , at which the marginal product of
labor equals the efficiency wage. If the efficiency
wage is above the market-clearing real wage,
employment is determined by labor demand. The
difference between the quantity of labor supplied
and the quantity of labor demanded at the efﬁciency
wage represents unemployment.
4. Full-employment output, , is the output that can be
produced when employment is at its full-employ-
ment level, , and worker effort is at the level
induced by the efﬁciency wage. The FE line in the
Keynesian IS–LM model is vertical where output
equals its full-employment level. In the Keynesian
model, full-employment output and the FE line are
affected by productivity shocks but not by changes in
labor supply because changes in labor supply don’t
affect employment in the efﬁciency wage model.

5. Keynesians attribute the nonneutrality of money to
price stickiness, which means that some ﬁrms may
not change their prices in the short run even though
the demand for or supply of their product has
changed. Price stickiness is contrary to the assump-
tion of the basic classical model that prices and
wages are completely ﬂexible.
6. Price stickiness can arise from the proﬁt-maximizing
behavior of monopolistically competitive ﬁrms that
face menu costs, or costs of changing prices. Such
ﬁrms are price setters rather than price takers, and
once they set their prices they meet customer
demand at that fixed price. These firms readjust
prices only occasionally, generally when costs or
demand have changed signiﬁcantly.
7. In the Keynesian model with sticky prices, output is
determined in the short run at the intersection of the
IS and LM curves. The economy can be off the FE
line in the short run because ﬁrms are willing to meet
demand at predetermined prices. The level of
employment in the short run is given by the effective
labor demand curve, which shows the amount of
labor needed to produce any given amount of
output. In the long run, after prices and wages have
completely adjusted, the LM curve moves to restore
general equilibrium with full employment.
8. The short-run and long-run equilibria in the Keyne-
sian model can also be analyzed with the AD–AS
model. The short-run equilibrium is represented by
the intersection of the downward-sloping aggregate
demand (AD) curve and the horizontal short-run
aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. In short-run equilib-
rium, monopolistically competitive firms produce
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:10 AM  Page 428
Chapter 11 Keynesianism: The Macroeconomics of Wage and Price Rigidity 429
whatever level of output is demanded at the ﬁxed
price level. Eventually, however, the price level
adjusts and the economy reaches its long-run equi-
librium, represented by the intersection of the AD
curve and the vertical long-run aggregate supply
(LRAS) curve. In long-run equilibrium, output equals
its full-employment level, .
9. In the Keynesian model, an increase in the money
supply shifts the LM curve down and to the right,
raising output and lowering the real interest rate in
the short run. Thus money isn’t neutral in the short
run. In the long run, however, money is neutral;
monetary expansion raises the price level propor-
tionally but has no real effects.
10. In the Keynesian model, an increase in government
purchases or a cut in taxes shifts the IS curve up and
to the right, raising output and the real interest rate
in the short run. In the long run, output returns to the
full-employment level but the real interest rate
increases. Fiscal policy isn’t neutral in the long
run because it affects the composition of output
among consumption, investment, and government
purchases.
11. Keynesians attribute most business cycles to aggre-
gate demand shocks. These shocks hit the IS curve
(changes in government purchases, desired con-
sumption, or desired investment) or the LM curve
Y
(changes in money supply or money demand). Key-
nesian business cycle theory, which has traditionally
emphasized the importance of aggregate demand
shocks, can account for the procyclical behavior of
employment, money, inflation, and investment. To
explain the procyclical behavior of average labor pro-
ductivity, the Keynesian theory must include the
additional assumption that ﬁrms hoard labor—that
is, they employ more workers than necessary during
recessions.
12. Macroeconomic stabilization, also called aggregate
demand management, is the use of monetary or ﬁscal
policy to try to eliminate recessions and keep the
economy at full employment. The Keynesian theory
suggests that macroeconomic stabilization is both
desirable and possible. However, practical problems
include the difﬁculty of measuring and forecasting
the state of the economy and determining how much
monetary and ﬁscal stimulus is needed at any partic-
ular time. Keynesian antirecessionary policies also
lead to a higher price level than would occur in the
absence of policy changes.
13. Following the oil price shocks of the 1970s, the Key-
nesian theory was modified to allow for supply
shocks. Supply shocks lead to stagﬂation (a combi-
nation of inﬂation and recession) and pose great dif-
ﬁculties for stabilization policy.

ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. According to the Keynesian IS–LM model, what is the
effect of each of the following on output, the real interest
rate, employment, and the price level? Distinguish
between the short run and the long run.
a. Increased tax incentives for investment (the tax
breaks for investment are offset by lump-sum tax
increases that keep total current tax collections
unchanged).
b. Increased tax incentives for saving [as in Part (a),
lump-sum tax increases offset the effect on total
current tax collections].
c. A wave of investor pessimism about the future
proﬁtability of capital investments.
d. An increase in consumer conﬁdence, as consumers
expect that their incomes will be higher in the
future.
2. According to the Keynesian IS–LM model, what is the
effect of each of the following on output, the real interest
rate, employment, and the price level? Distinguish
between the short run and the long run.
a. Financial deregulation allows banks to pay a
higher interest rate on checking accounts.
b. The introduction of sophisticated credit cards
greatly reduces the amount of money that people
need for transactions.
c. A severe water shortage causes sharp declines in
agricultural output and increases in food prices.
d. A temporary beneﬁcial supply shock affects most
of the economy, but no individual ﬁrm is affected
sufﬁciently to change its prices in the short run.
3. Suppose that the Fed has a policy of increasing the
money supply when it observes that the economy is in
recession. However, suppose that about six months are
needed for an increase in the money supply to affect
aggregate demand, which is about the same amount of
time needed for ﬁrms to review and reset their prices.
What effects will the Fed’s policy have on output and
price stability? Does your answer change if (a) the Fed
has some ability to forecast recessions or (b) price adjust-
ment takes longer than six months?
4. Classical economists argue that using ﬁscal policy to
ﬁght a recession doesn’t make workers better off. Sup-
pose, however, that the Keynesian model is correct. Rel-
ative to a policy of doing nothing, does an increase in
government purchases that brings the economy to full
employment make workers better off? In answering the
question, discuss the effects of the ﬁscal expansion on the
real wage, employment, consumption, and current and
future taxes. How does your answer depend on (a) the
direct beneﬁts of the government spending program and
(b) the speed with which prices adjust in the absence of
ﬁscal stimulus?
5. Some labor economists argue that it is useful to think of
the labor market as being divided into two sectors: a pri-
mary sector, where “good” (high-paying, long-term) jobs
are located, and a secondary sector, which has “bad”
(low-paying, short-term) jobs. Suppose that the primary
sector has a high marginal product of labor and that
(because effort is costly for ﬁrms to monitor) ﬁrms pay an
efﬁciency wage. The secondary sector has a low margin-
al product of labor and no efﬁciency wage; instead, the
real wage in the secondary sector adjusts so that the
quantities of labor demanded and supplied are equal in
that sector. Workers are alike, and all would prefer to
work in the primary sector. However, workers who can’t
ﬁnd jobs in the primary sector work in the secondary
sector.
What are the effects of each of the following on the
real wage, employment, and output in both sectors?
a. Expansionary monetary policy increases the
demand for primary sector output.
b. Immigration increases the labor force.
c. The effort curve changes so that a higher real wage
is needed to elicit the greatest effort per dollar in
the primary sector. Effort exerted at the higher real
wage is the same as before the change in the effort
curve.
d. There is a temporary productivity improvement in
the primary sector.
e. There is a temporary productivity improvement in
the secondary sector.

WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. Keynesian theory predicts that expansionary fiscal
policy—either higher spending or lower taxes—will
raise the real interest rate.
Using data since 1960, graph the Federal govern-
ment budget deﬁcit, the state-local government budget
deﬁcit (both relative to GDP), and the real interest rate
(three-month Treasury bill rate minus the CPI inﬂation
rate over the preceding twelve-month period). Do you
see a link between deﬁcits and real interest rates? In what
period does the relationship seem clearest? Do your
answers change when the ten-year government bond
interest rate is used instead of the three-month rate?
2. Because of price stickiness, the Keynesian model pre-
dicts that an increase in the growth rate of money will
lead to higher inﬂation only after some lag, when ﬁrms
begin to adjust their prices. Using data since 1960, graph
the inﬂation rate and the rate of growth of M2. Prior to
1980, is it true that increases in money growth only affect-
ed inﬂation with a lag? What has happened since 1980?
Keynesians argue that ﬁnancial innovations, such
as the introduction of money market deposit accounts at
banks, led to a large increase in the demand for M2 in the
early 1980s. If this claim is true, how does it help explain
the relationship between money growth and inﬂation
that you observe after 1980?
3. Working with Macroeconomic Data Exercise 1,
Chapter 10, asked you to look at the cyclical behavior
of total factor productivity. If you have not completed
that problem, do it now and compare productivity
changes with changes in the producer price index for
fuels and related products and power. How would
Keynesian interpretations differ from those offered by
classical macroeconomics?

Labor Contracts and Nominal-Wage
Rigidity
In the Keynesian theory, the nonneutrality of money is a consequence of nominal
rigidity. In this chapter we emphasized nominal-price rigidity . An alternative nom-
inal rigidity that could account for the nonneutrality of money, which many Key-
nesians emphasize, is nominal-wage rigidity. Nominal-wage rigidity could reﬂect
long-term labor contracts between ﬁrms and unions in which wages are set in
nominal terms (the case we study here). In terms of the AD–AS framework the dif-
ference between nominal-price rigidity and nominal-wage rigidity is that nominal-
price rigidity implies a horizontal short-run aggregate supply curve, whereas
nominal-wage rigidity implies a short-run aggregate supply curve that slopes
upward. However, this difference doesn’t really affect the results obtained from the
Keynesian model. In particular, in the Keynesian model with nominal-wage rigid-
ity, money remains nonneutral in the short run and neutral in the long run.
The Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve with Labor Contracts
In the United States most labor contracts specify employment conditions and nom-
inal wages for a period of three years. Although labor contracts specify the nomi-
nal wage rate, they usually don’t specify the total amount of employment. Instead,
employers unilaterally decide how many hours will be worked and whether work-
ers will be laid off. These factors imply that the short-run aggregate supply curve
slopes upward.
We can see why the short-run aggregate supply curve slopes upward when
labor contracts prespecify the nominal wage by considering what happens when
the price level increases. With the nominal wage, W, already determined by the con-
tract, an increase in the price level, P, reduces the real wage, w, or W / P. In response
to the drop in the real wage, ﬁrms demand more labor. Because ﬁrms unilaterally
choose the level of employment, the increase in the amount of labor demanded
leads to an increase in employment and therefore an increase in output. Thus an
increase in the price level leads to an increase in the amount of output supplied, as
shown by the SRAS curves in Fig. 11.A.1.
Nonneutrality of Money
Money is nonneutral in the short run in the model with long-term labor contracts,
as illustrated in Fig. 11.A.1. The initial general equilibrium is at point E, where the
initial aggregate demand curve, AD
1
, intersects the short-run aggregate supply
curve, SRAS
1
. A 10% increase in the money supply shifts the AD curve up to AD
2
.
(For any level of output the price level is 10% higher on AD
2
than on AD
1
.) In the
APPENDIX 11.A
M11_ABEL4529_07_SE_C11.QXD  12/6/09  2:10 AM  Page 434
short run, the increase in the money supply raises the price level to P
2
and output
to Y
2
at point F. Output at F is higher than its full-employment level because the rise
in prices lowers the real wage, which leads ﬁrms to employ more labor and pro-
duce more output.
At the short-run equilibrium point, F, however, workers will be dissatisﬁed
because their real wages are lower than they had expected. Over time, as contracts
are renewed or renegotiated, nominal wages will rise to offset the increase in prices.
At any price level, a rise in the nominal wage also raises the real wage, inducing
ﬁrms to employ less labor and produce less output. Thus rising nominal wages
cause the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift up and to the left, from SRAS
1
to SRAS
2
. Eventually, general equilibrium is restored at point H.
In the long run at point H, the price level rises to P
3
, which is 10% higher than
its initial value, P
1
. At H the nominal wage, W, has also increased by 10% so that the
real wage, W / P, has returned to its initial value. With the real wage back at its orig-
inal value, ﬁrms employ the same amount of labor and produce the same amount of
output ( ) as they did at the initial equilibrium point, E. Thus, as in the Keynesian
model based on efﬁciency wages and price stickiness, in the Keynesian model with
nominal-wage rigidity, money is neutral in the long run but not in the short run.
Although nominal-wage rigidity arising from labor contracts can explain short-
run monetary nonneutrality , some economists object to this explanation. One objec-
tion is that less than one-sixth of the labor force in the United States is unionized and
covered by long-term labor contracts. However, many nonunion workers receive
wages similar to those set in union contracts. For example, although most nonunion
workers don’t have formal wage contracts, they may have “implicit contracts” with
their employers, or informal unwritten arrangements for comparable wages.
A second objection is that many labor contracts contain cost-of-living adjust-
ments (COLAs), which tie the nominal wage to the overall price level, as measured,
Y

for example, by the consumer price index. Contracts with complete indexation
increase the nominal wage by the same percentage as the increase in the price
level. If wages are completely indexed to the price level, the short-run aggregate
supply curve is vertical and money is neutral. To show why, let’s suppose that the
price level increases by 6%. If labor contracts are completely indexed, nominal
wages also increase by 6% and the real wage, W / P, remains unchanged. Because the
real wage doesn’t change, ﬁrms choose the same levels of employment and output
independent of the price level.
However, in most U.S. labor contracts, wages aren’t completely indexed to
prices. In recent years, fewer than one-fourth of the workers covered by major pri-
vate industry bargaining agreements have had any COLA provisions. Further-
more, most contracts with COLA provisions have partial rather than complete
indexation. For example, under a contract that calls for 50% indexation, the nomi-
nal wage will increase by 50% of the overall rate of increase in prices. Thus, if the
price level increases by 6%, the nominal wage increases by 3%. As a result, the real
wage falls by 3% (a 3% increase in the nominal wage, W, minus a 6% increase in the
price level, P). The reduction in the real wage induces ﬁrms to increase employment
and production. Thus with partial indexation the short-run aggregate supply curve
again slopes upward, and money isn’t neutral in the short run.
A third and ﬁnal objection is that this theory predicts that real wages will be
countercyclical, contrary to the business cycle fact that real wages are procyclical.
For example, at point F in Fig. 11.A.1, output is higher than the full-employment
level, but the real wage is lower than at full employment (indeed, the low real wage
induces ﬁrms to produce the extra output). Thus the theory holds that real wages
will fall in booms—that is, the real wage is countercyclical—which is inconsistent
with the evidence.
However, perhaps both supply shocks and aggregate demand shocks affect
real wages. For the real business cycle theory we showed that, if productivity
shocks cause cyclical ﬂuctuations, the real wage should be procyclical, perhaps
strongly so. A combination of supply shocks (which cause the real wage to move
procyclically) and aggregate demand shocks (which, as in Fig. 11.A.1, cause the real
wage to move countercyclically) might average out to a real wage that is at least
mildly procyclical. Some evidence for this view was provided in a study by Scott
Sumner of Bentley College and Stephen Silver
18
of Virginia Military Institute,
which shows that the real wage has been procyclical during periods dominated by
supply shocks but has been countercyclical during periods in which aggregate
demand shocks were more important.

Worked-Out Numerical Exercise 
for Calculating the Multiplier 
in a Keynesian Model
This is a worked-out numerical exercise, as an example for solving the model from
Appendix 9.A, applied to a question about the government spending multiplier. In
that problem, the economy is given by the following equations:
In Appendix 9.A, we found the short-run and long-run equilibrium values of Y, P,
r, T, C, I, and i. Now we want to calculate the government spending multiplier in
the short run if government spending rises from 600 to 690. (Of course, in the long
run, the multiplier is zero, because output will be at its full-employment level, and
increases in government spending do not affect the full-employment level of
output in the Keynesian model.) To do this, we use the short-run equilibrium
results from Appendix 9.A and then repeat our procedure with the higher level of
government spending to see how output is affected. From that, we can calculate the
multiplier, which is the change in output divided by the change in government
spending.
In Appendix 9.A, we found that in the short run, With an increase in
government spending, in the short run, the IS curve will change, but the LM curve
will be the same as before, 
First, we ﬁnd the equation for the IS curve by using the goods market equilib-
rium condition. The goods market equilibrium condition is Sub-
stitute the equation for T into the equation for C
d
from above. Then substitute the
resulting equation and the equation for I
d
from above, along with the value of G, into
to obtain: 
Rearrange this equation as an equation for r in terms of Y: 
so 
so 
so Therefore, 
so r = 2.23 - 0.0008Y. This is the IS curve.
Next, we ﬁnd the intersection of the IS and LM curves to calculate the short-run
equilibrium values of Y and r. We have written the equations of the IS and LM
curves so that the left side of each equation is simply r. Setting the right side of the
IS equation equal to the right side of the LM equation yields 
so Therefore, Y = 4.5/0.0018 = 2500. 4.5 = 0.0018Y. 0.001Y - 2.27,

The Multiplier in the Keynesian Model
In Chapter 11 we deﬁned the multiplier associated with any particular type of
spending as the short-run change in total output resulting from a one-unit change
in that type of spending. Here we use the analysis in Appendix 9.B to derive the
multiplier associated with government purchases G. We proceed in three steps:
First, we calculate the effect on (the intercept of the IS curve in Eq. 9.B.14) of an
increase in G. Then, we calculate the effect on the short-run equilibrium value of Y,
shown by Eq. (9.B.27), of an increase in α
IS
. Finally, we combine these two effects to
calculate the effect on output, Y, of an increase in G.
To calculate the effect on α
IS
of an increase in G, we repeat the deﬁnition of α
IS
,
Eq. (9.B.15):
(11.C.1)
where c

, and t

are parameters that determine desired consumption and
desired investment (see Appendix 9.B). If G increases by ΔG, then α
IS
increases by
so
(11.C.2)
Next, recall from Eq. (9.B.27) that, in the short run when the level of
output is
(11.C.3)
Observe from Eq. (11.C.3) that, if increases by , output, Y, increases by
or
(11.C.4)
Finally, if we substitute the right side of Eq. (11.C.2) for on the right side
of Eq. (11.C.4) and then divide both sides of the resulting equation by , we
obtain
(11.C.5)
The right side of Eq. (11.C.5) is the increase in short-run equilibrium output, Y,
that occurs for each one-unit increase in government purchases, G. In other words,
it is the government purchases multiplier. Similar calculations show that changes

)
have the same multiplier as government purchases.
Because c
r
, i
r
, , and all are positive, the multiplier is positive. However,
depending on the speciﬁc values of those parameters, the multiplier may be greater
or less than 1. A case in which the multiplier is likely to be large occurs when the
LM curve is horizontal (that is, when the slope of the LM curve, , is 0). If the LM
curve is horizontal, shifts in the IS curve induced by changes in spending have rel-
atively large effects on output. Recall that Eq. (9.B.16) gives the slope of the IS
curve, , as [1 - (1 - t)c
Y
]/(c
r
+ i
r
). Making this substitution and setting the slope
of the LM curve, , at 0 yield a simple form of the multiplier:
(11.C.6)
For example, suppose that the marginal propensity to consume, c
Y
, is 0.8 and that
the tax rate, t, is 0.25. Then the multiplier defined in Eq. (11.C.6) is 
or 2.5. If the LM curve is very steep, by contrast—that is, 
is large—then the multiplier could be quite small, as you can see from Eq. (11.C.5).

CHAPTER 12
Unemployment 
and Inﬂation
In the past several chapters we focused on the concepts of the business cycle, macro-
economic stabilization, and classical and Keynesian approaches to business cycle
analysis. Although these concepts are central to today’s macroeconomics, actual
policy discussions rarely involve such abstract terms. Policy debates tend to focus on
highly publicized economic statistics such as inﬂation and unemployment. To make
a stronger connection between business cycle theories and policy debates, we now
take a closer look at unemployment and inﬂation, ﬁrst together and then separately.
Unemployment and inﬂation—sometimes referred to as the “twin evils” of macro-
economics—are among the most difﬁcult and politically sensitive economic issues
that policymakers face. High rates of unemployment and inﬂation generate intense
public concern because their effects are direct and visible: Almost everyone is affected
by rising prices, and few workers can be conﬁdent that they will never lose their jobs.
Moreover, there is a long-standing idea in macroeconomics that unemployment
and inﬂation are somehow related. In the ﬁrst part of this chapter we discuss in
some detail the concept of the Phillips curve—an empirical relationship between
inﬂation and unemployment. According to the Phillips curve, inﬂation tends to be
low when unemployment is high and high when unemployment is low. The
Phillips curve relationship raises some important questions about how the econo-
my works and how macroeconomic policies should be used.
We then look at unemployment and inﬂation separately. We examine the costs
that each imposes on society and consider the options that policymakers have for
dealing with these problems.
This chapter begins Part 4 of the book, the purpose of which is to explore
macroeconomic policymaking in detail. Following the discussion of inﬂation and
unemployment in this chapter, in Chapter 13 we address the issue of how economic
openness—as reﬂected in the trading and ﬁnancial links among countries—affects
macroeconomic policy. In Chapter 14 we take a closer look at institutions and
debates related to the making of monetary policy and in Chapter 15 we provide a
similar overview of ﬁscal policy.
12.1 Unemployment and Inflation: Is There a Trade-Off?
Newspaper editorials and public discussions about economic policy often refer to the
“trade-off” between inﬂation and unemployment. The idea is that, to reduce inﬂa-
tion, the economy must tolerate high unemployment, or alternatively that, to reduce

unemployment, more inﬂation must be accepted. This section examines the idea of
an inﬂation–unemployment trade-off and its implications for macroeconomic policy .
The origin of the idea of a trade-off between inﬂation and unemployment was
a 1958 article by economist A. W. Phillips.
1
Phillips examined ninety-seven years of
British data on unemployment and nominal wage growth and found that, histori-
cally, unemployment tended to be low in years when nominal wages grew rapidly
and high in years when nominal wages grew slowly. Economists who built on
Phillips’s work shifted its focus slightly by looking at the link between unemploy-
ment and inﬂation—that is, the growth rate of prices—rather than the link between
unemployment and the growth rate of wages. During the late 1950s and the 1960s,
many statistical studies examined inﬂation and unemployment data for numerous
countries and time periods, in many cases ﬁnding a negative relationship between
the two variables. This negative empirical relationship between unemployment
and inﬂation is known as the Phillips curve.
A striking example of a Phillips curve, shown in Fig. 12.1, occurred in the United
States during the 1960s. The U.S. economy expanded throughout most of the 1960s,
with unemployment falling and inﬂation rising steadily . In Fig. 12.1, the inﬂation rate
is measured on the vertical axis, and the unemployment rate is measured on the hor-
izontal axis. Note that years, such as 1961, that had high unemployment also had low
inﬂation, and that years, such as 1969, that had high inﬂation also had low unem-
ployment. The data produce an almost perfect downward-sloping relation between
inﬂation and unemployment—that is, a Phillips curve. The experience of the United
States in the 1960s, which came after Phillips’s article had been published and widely
disseminated, was viewed by many as a conﬁrmation of his basic ﬁnding.
The policy implications of these ﬁndings were much debated. Initially, the
Phillips curve seemed to offer policymakers a “menu” of combinations of inﬂation
and unemployment from which they could choose. Indeed, during the 1960s some
economists argued that, by accepting a modest amount of inﬂation, macroeco-
nomic policymakers could keep the unemployment rate low indeﬁnitely. This
belief seemed to be borne out during the 1960s, when rising inﬂation was accom-
panied by falling unemployment.
In the following decades, however, this relationship between inﬂation and
unemployment failed to hold: Figure 12.2 shows inﬂation and unemployment for
the period 1970–2008. During those years, unlike the 1960s, there seemed to be no
reliable relationship between unemployment and inﬂation. From the perspective of
the Phillips curve the most puzzling period was the mid 1970s, during which the
country experienced high inflation and high unemployment simultaneously
(stagﬂation). In 1975, for example, unemployment reached 8.5% of the labor force
and the annual inﬂation rate was 9.1%. High unemployment, together with high
inﬂation, is inconsistent with the Phillips curve.
The original empirical results of Phillips and others who extended his work,
together with the unexpected experience of the U.S. economy after 1970, raise at
least three important questions:
■ Why was the original Phillips curve relationship between inﬂation and unem-
ployment frequently observed historically, as in the cases of Great Britain in
the century before 1958 and the United States in the 1960s?

444 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
■ Why did the simple negative relationship between inﬂation and unemploy-
ment that seemed to exist during the 1960s in the United States vanish after
1970? In other words, was there in fact no systematic relationship between
inﬂation and unemployment in the U.S. economy after 1970?
■ Does the Phillips curve actually provide a menu of choices from which policy-
makers can choose? For example, by electing to maintain a high inﬂation rate
can policymakers guarantee a permanently low rate of unemployment?
Economic theory provides reasonable answers to these questions; in particular,
it explains the collapse of the Phillips curve after 1970. Interestingly, the key eco-
nomic analysis of the Phillips curve—which predicted that this relationship would
not be stable—was done during the 1960s, before the Phillips curve had actually
broken down. Thus we have at least one example of economic theorists predicting
an important development in the economy that policymakers and the public didn’t
anticipate.
The Expectations-Augmented Phillips Curve
Although the Phillips curve seemed to describe adequately the unemployment–
inﬂation relationship in the United States in the 1960s, during the second half of the
decade some economists, notably Nobel Laureates Milton Friedman
2
of the Uni-
versity of Chicago and Edmund Phelps
3
of Columbia University, questioned the
logic of the Phillips curve. Friedman and Phelps argued—purely on the basis of
economic theory—that there should not be a stable negative relationship between
inﬂation and unemployment. Instead, a negative relationship should exist between
unanticipated inﬂation (the difference between the actual and expected inﬂation
rates) and cyclical unemployment (the difference between the actual and natural
unemployment rates).
4
Although these distinctions appear to be merely technical,
they are crucial in understanding the relationship between the actual rates of inﬂa-
tion and unemployment.
Before discussing the signiﬁcance of their analyses, we need to explain how
Friedman and Phelps arrived at their conclusions. To do so we use the extended
classical model, which includes the misperceptions theory. (Analytical Problem 3 at
the end of the chapter asks you to perform a similar analysis using the Keynesian
model.) We proceed in two steps, ﬁrst considering an economy at full employ-
ment with steady, fully anticipated inﬂation. In this economy, both unanticipated
inﬂation and cyclical unemployment are zero. Second, we consider what happens
when aggregate demand growth increases unexpectedly. In this case both positive
unanticipated inflation (inflation greater than expected) and negative cyclical
unemployment (actual unemployment lower than the natural rate) occur. This out-
come demonstrates the Friedman–Phelps point that a negative relationship exists
between unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical unemployment.

In Chapter 3 we deﬁned cyclical unemployment. Recall that the natural rate of unemployment is the
unemployment rate that exists when output is at its full-employment level. The natural rate exceeds
zero because of frictional and structural unemployment, also deﬁned in Chapter 3.
M12_ABEL4529_07_SE_C12.QXD  12/9/09  4:03 PM  Page 444
Chapter 12 Unemployment and Inﬂation 445
We develop the ﬁrst step of this analysis by using the extended classical model
to analyze an economy with steady inﬂation (see Fig. 12.3). We assume that this
economy is in full-employment equilibrium in which the money supply has been
growing at 10% per year for many years and is expected to continue to grow at this
rate indeﬁnitely. With the money supply growing by 10% per year, the aggregate
demand curve shifts up by 10% each year, from AD
1
in year 1 to AD
2
in year 2, and
so on. For simplicity we assume that full-employment output, , is constant, but
relaxing that assumption wouldn’t affect our basic conclusions.
In Fig. 12.3 the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shifts up by 10% each
year. Why? With the growth in money supply fully anticipated, there are no mis-
perceptions. Instead, people expect the price level to rise by 10% per year (a 10%
inﬂation rate), which in turn causes the SRAS curve to shift up by 10% per year. With
no misperceptions, the economy remains at full employment with output at . For
example, when the expected price level is 100 in year 1, the short-run aggregate
supply curve is SRAS
1
. At point E the price level is 100 (the same as the expected
price level) and output is . In year 2 the expected price level is 110, and the short-
run aggregate supply curve is SRAS
2
. In year 2 equilibrium occurs at point F, again
with output of and equal expected and actual price levels. Each year, both the AD
curve and the SRAS curve shift up by 10%, increasing the actual price level and
expected price level by 10% and maintaining output at its full-employment level.
What happens to unemployment in this economy? Because output is continu-
ously at its full-employment level, , unemployment remains at the natural rate, .
With unemployment at its natural rate, cyclical unemployment is zero. Hence this
economy has zero unanticipated inﬂation and zero cyclical unemployment.
Against this backdrop of 10% monetary growth and 10% inﬂation, suppose
now that in year 2 the money supply grows by 15% rather than by the expected

grows by 10% every year,
the AD curve shifts up
by 10% every year, from

money supply has been
growing by 10% per year
for some time and the
rate of inﬂation has been

expected rate of inﬂation
also is 10%. Thus the
expected price level also
grows by 10% each year,

10% (Fig. 12.4). In this case, instead of being 10% higher than AD
1
(as shown by
AD
2,old
), the aggregate demand curve in year 2 will be 15% higher than AD
1
(as
shown by AD
2,new
). If this increase in the rate of monetary growth is unanticipated
at the beginning of year 2, the expected price level in year 2 remains at 110, and the
short-run aggregate supply curve is SRAS
2
, as before. The short-run equilibrium in
year 2 is at point G, the intersection of the AD
2,new
and SRAS
2
curves. At G the price
level is 113, so the actual rate of inﬂation in year 2 is 13%. Because the expected rate
of inﬂation was 10%, the 13% inﬂation rate implies unanticipated inﬂation of 3% in
year 2. Furthermore, because output is above its full-employment level, , at G, the
actual unemployment rate is below the natural rate and cyclical unemployment is
negative.
Why is output above its full-employment level in year 2? Note that, in year 2,
the 13% rate of inﬂation is less than the 15% rate of money growth but greater than the
10% expected rate of inﬂation. Because the price level grows by less than does the
nominal money supply in year 2, the real money supply, M/ P, increases, lowering
the real interest rate and raising the aggregate quantity of goods demanded above .
At the same time, because the price level grows by more than expected, the aggregate
quantity of goods supplied also is greater than , as producers are fooled into think-
ing that the relative prices of their products have increased.
Producers can’t be fooled about price behavior indeﬁnitely, however. In the
long run, producers learn the true price level, the economy returns to full employ-
ment, and the inﬂation rate again equals the expected inﬂation rate, as in Fig. 12.3.
In the meantime, however, as long as actual output is higher than full-employment
output, , and actual unemployment is below the natural rate, , the actual price
level must be higher than the expected price level. Indeed, according to the

If the money supply has

ly increases by 15% in

pated inﬂation is associ-
ated with output higher

ment below the natural
rate, (negative cyclical
unemployment).

misperceptions theory, output can be higher than only when prices are higher
than expected (and therefore when inﬂation is also higher than expected).
Thus, in this economy, when the public correctly predicts aggregate demand
growth and inﬂation, unanticipated inﬂation is zero, actual unemployment equals
the natural rate, and cyclical unemployment is zero (Fig. 12.3). However, if aggre-
gate demand growth unexpectedly speeds up, the economy faces a period of pos-
itive unanticipated inflation and negative cyclical unemployment (Fig. 12.4).
Similarly, an unexpected slowdown in aggregate demand growth could occur,
causing the AD curve to rise more slowly than expected; for a time unanticipated
inﬂation would be negative (actual inﬂation less than expected) and cyclical unem-
ployment would be positive (actual unemployment greater than the natural rate).
The relationship between unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical unemployment
implied by this analysis is
where
unanticipated inﬂation (the difference between actual inﬂation, 
p, and expected inﬂation, p
e
);
cyclical unemployment (the difference between the actual 
unemployment rate, u, and the natural unemployment rate, );
a positive number that measures the slope of the relationship 
between unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical unemployment.
The preceding equation expresses mathematically the idea that unanticipated inﬂa-
tion will be positive when cyclical unemployment is negative, negative when cycli-
cal unemployment is positive, and zero when cyclical unemployment is zero.

If we
add p
e
to both sides of the equation, it becomes
(12.1)
Equation (12.1) describes the expectations-augmented Phillips curve. According to
the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, actual inﬂation, p, exceeds expected
inﬂation, p
e
, if the actual unemployment rate, u, is less than the natural rate, ;
actual inﬂation is less than expected inﬂation if the unemployment rate exceeds the
natural rate.
The Shifting Phillips Curve
Let’s return to the original Phillips curve, which links the levels of inﬂation and
unemployment in the economy. The insight gained from the Friedman–Phelps
analysis is that the relationship illustrated by the Phillips curve depends on the
expected rate of inﬂation and the natural rate of unemployment. If either factor
changes, the Phillips curve will shift.

The equation also implies that the relationship between unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical unem-
ployment is linear, but this formulation is for convenience only. The relationship of the two variables
might as easily be a curve as a line.

unemployment, according to the Friedman–Phelps theory. The curve PC
1
is the
Phillips curve for an expected rate of inﬂation of 3%. What identiﬁes the expected
rate of inﬂation as 3% along PC
1
? Equation (12.1) indicates that, when the actual
unemployment rate equals the natural rate (6% in this example), the actual
inﬂation rate equals the expected inﬂation rate. Thus, to determine the expected
inﬂation rate on a Phillips curve, we ﬁnd the inﬂation rate at the point where the
actual unemployment rate equals the natural rate. For instance, at point A on
curve PC
1
, the unemployment rate equals the natural rate, and the actual and
expected rates of inﬂation both equal 3%. As long as the expected inﬂation rate
remains at 3% (and the natural unemployment rate remains at 6%), the Phillips
curve PC
1
will describe the relationship between inﬂation and unemployment.
Now suppose that the expected rate of inﬂation increases from 3% to 12%.
Figure 12.5 shows that this 9 percentage point increase in the expected rate of inﬂa-
tion shifts the Phillips curve up by 9 percentage points at each level of the unem-
ployment rate, from PC
1
to PC
2
. When the actual unemployment rate equals the
natural rate on PC
2
(at point B), the inflation rate is 12%, confirming that the
expected inﬂation rate is 12% along PC
2
. Comparing PC
2
and PC
1
reveals that an
increase in the expected inﬂation rate shifts the Phillips curve relationship between
inﬂation and unemployment up and to the right.
Changes in the Natural Rate of Unemployment. The Phillips curve relation-
ship between inﬂation and unemployment also is shifted by changes in the
natural unemployment rate, as illustrated by Fig. 12.6. The Phillips curve PC
1
shows a natural unemployment rate at 6% and an expected inﬂation rate at 3%
(PC
1
in Fig. 12.6 is the same as PC
1
in Fig. 12.5). Now suppose that the natural
unemployment rate increases to 7% but that the expected inﬂation rate remains
Figure 12.5
The shifting Phillips
curve: an increase in
expected inﬂation
The Friedman–Phelps
theory implies that there
is a different Phillips
curve for every expected
inﬂation rate. For exam-
ple, PC
1
is the Phillips
curve when the expected
rate of inﬂation is 3%. To
verify this claim, note
from Eq. (12.1) that,
when the actual unem-
ployment rate equals the
natural rate, (6% here),
the actual inﬂation rate
equals the expected inﬂa-
tion rate. At point A, the
unemployment rate
equals the natural rate
and the inﬂation rate
equals 3% on PC
1
, so the
expected inﬂation rate is
3% on PC
1
. Similarly, at
point B on PC
2
, where
the unemployment rate
equals its natural rate,
the inﬂation rate is 12%,
so the expected inﬂation
rate is 12% along PC
2
.
Thus an increase in the
expected inﬂation rate
from 3% to 12% shifts the
Phillips curve up and to
the right, from PC
1
to
PC

unchanged at 3%. As Fig. 12.6 shows, the increase in the natural unemployment
rate causes the Phillips curve to shift, from PC
1
to PC
3
.
To conﬁrm that the natural unemployment rate corresponding to Phillips curve
PC
3
in Fig. 12.6 is 7%, look at point C on PC
3
: At C, where the actual and expected
inﬂation rates are equal, the unemployment rate is 7%. Thus the natural unem-
ployment rate associated with Phillips curve PC
3
is 7%. This example illustrates
that—like an increase in expected inﬂation—an increase in the natural unemploy-
ment rate causes the Phillips curve relationship between inﬂation and unemploy-
ment to shift up and to the right.
Supply Shocks and the Phillips Curve. The Friedman–Phelps theory holds that
changes in either expected inﬂation or the natural unemployment rate will shift
the Phillips curve. One type of economic disturbance that is likely to affect both
factors is a supply shock. Recall that an adverse supply shock causes a burst of
inﬂation, which may lead people to expect higher inﬂation.
6
An adverse supply
shock also tends to increase the natural unemployment rate, although the reasons
for this effect are different in the classical and Keynesian models.
Recall that, from the classical perspective, an adverse supply shock raises the
natural rate of unemployment by increasing the degree of mismatch between work-
ers and jobs. For example, an oil price shock eliminates jobs in heavy-energy-using
industries but increases employment in energy-providing industries.
In the Keynesian model, recall that much of the unemployment that exists
even when the economy is at the full-employment level is blamed on rigid real
wages. In particular, if the efﬁciency wage is above the market-clearing real wage,
6
The inﬂationary impact of a supply shock will be reinforced if, in an attempt to moderate the rise in
unemployment caused by the shock, the central bank increases the money supply.
Figure 12.6
The shifting Phillips
curve: an increase in
the natural
unemployment rate
According to the
Friedman–Phelps theory,
an increase in the natural
unemployment rate
shifts the Phillips curve
up and to the right. At
point A on PC
1
, the
actual inﬂation rate and
the expected inﬂation
rate are equal at 3%, so
the natural unemploy-
ment rate equals the
actual unemployment
rate at A, or 6%. Thus
PC
1
is the Phillips curve
when the natural unem-
ployment rate is 6% and
the expected inﬂation
rate is 3%, as in Fig. 12.5.
If the natural unemploy-
ment rate increases to
7%, with expected inﬂa-
tion unchanged, the
Phillips curve shifts to
PC
3
. At point C on PC
3
,
both expected and actual
inﬂation equal 3%, so the
natural unemployment
rate equals the actual
unemployment rate at C,
or 7%.

the amount of labor supplied at the efﬁciency wage will exceed the amount of
labor demanded at that wage (Fig. 11.2), leading to persistent structural unem-
ployment. An adverse supply shock has no effect on the supply of labor,
7
but it
does reduce the marginal product of labor and thus labor demand. With a rigid efﬁ-
ciency wage, the drop in labor demand increases the excess of labor supplied over
labor demanded, raising the amount of unemployment that exists when the econ-
omy is at full employment. Thus, as in the classical model, the Keynesian model
predicts that an adverse supply shock will raise the natural unemployment rate.
Because adverse supply shocks raise both expected inﬂation and the natural
unemployment rate, according to the Friedman–Phelps analysis they should cause
the Phillips curve to shift up and to the right. Similarly, beneﬁcial supply shocks
should shift the Phillips curve down and to the left. Overall, the Phillips curve
should be particularly unstable during periods of supply shocks.
The Shifting Phillips Curve in Practice. Our analysis of the shifting Phillips
curve (Figs. 12.5 and 12.6) helps answer the basic questions about the Phillips
curve raised earlier in the chapter. The ﬁrst question was: Why did the original
Phillips curve relationship between inﬂation and unemployment apply to many
historical cases, including the United States during the 1960s? The Friedman–
Phelps analysis shows that a negative relationship between the levels of inﬂation
and unemployment holds as long as expected inﬂation and the natural unemployment
rate are approximately constant. As shown in Fig. 12.9 later in this chapter, the
natural unemployment rate changes relatively slowly, and during the 1960s it
changed very little. Expected inﬂation probably was also nearly constant in the
United States in the 1960s, because at that time people were used to low and
stable inﬂation and inﬂation remained low for most of the decade. Thus, not
surprisingly, the U.S. inﬂation and unemployment data for the 1960s seem to lie
along a single Phillips curve (Fig. 12.1).
The second question was: Why did the Phillips curve relationship, so apparent
in the United States in the 1960s, seem to disappear after 1970 (Fig. 12.2)? The
answer suggested by the Friedman–Phelps analysis is that, in the period after 1970,
the expected inﬂation rate and the natural unemployment rate varied considerably
more than they had in the 1960s, causing the Phillips curve relationship to shift
erratically.
Contributing to the shifts of the Phillips curve after 1970 were the two large
supply shocks associated with sharp increases in the price of oil that hit the U.S.
economy in 1973–1974 and 1979–1980. Recall that adverse supply shocks are likely
to increase both expected inﬂation and the natural rate of unemployment, shifting
the Phillips curve up and to the right.
Beyond the direct effects of supply shocks, other forces may have increased the
variability of expected inﬂation and the natural unemployment rate after 1970. As
we discuss later in the chapter, the natural unemployment rate ﬁrst rose, then fell
during this period as a result of changes in the composition of the labor force and
other changes in the economy.
Expected inﬂation probably varied more after 1970 because actual inﬂation varied
more (see Fig. 2.1 for the U.S. inﬂation rate for 1960–2008). After being relatively low
7
This statement is strictly true only for a temporary adverse supply shock. A permanent adverse
supply shock, if it reduces expected future wages, would increase labor supply and thus cause an
even larger rise in the natural rate of unemployment.

Chapter 12 Unemployment and Inﬂation 451
for a long time, inﬂation—driven by monetary and ﬁscal policies that had probably
been over-expansionary for several years—emerged as a problem at the end of the
1960s.
8
The 1970s were a period of high and erratic inﬂation, the result of the oil price
shocks and macroeconomic policies that again were probably too expansionary , espe-
cially in the latter part of the decade. In contrast, following the tough anti-inﬂationary
policies of the Federal Reserve during 1979–1982, inﬂation returned to a relatively low
level during the 1980s. To the extent that expected inﬂation followed the path of
actual inﬂation—high and erratic in the 1970s, low in the 1980s—our analysis suggests
that the Phillips curve relationship between inﬂation and unemployment wouldn’t
have been stable over the period.
Does the unstable Phillips curve during 1970–2008 imply that there was no sys-
tematic relationship between inﬂation and unemployment during that period? The
answer is “no.” According to the Friedman–Phelps analysis, a negative relationship
between unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical unemployment should appear in the data,
even if expected inﬂation and the natural unemployment rate are changing. Measures
of unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical unemployment for each year during the period
1970–2008 are shown in Fig. 12.7. These measures are approximate because we can’t
directly observe either expected inﬂation (needed to calculate unanticipated inﬂa-
tion) or the natural unemployment rate (needed to ﬁnd cyclical unemployment). We
used the forecast of CPI inﬂation from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
Livingston Survey to represent expected inﬂation for each year, and we used estimates
of the natural unemployment rate presented later in the chapter in Fig. 12.9.
Figure 12.7 suggests that, despite the instability of the traditional Phillips
curve relationship between inﬂation and unemployment, a negative relationship
between unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical unemployment did exist during the
period 1970–2008, as predicted by the Friedman–Phelps analysis (compare Fig.
12.7 to Fig. 12.2). In particular, note that inﬂation was much lower than expected
and that cyclical unemployment was high during 1982 and 1983, both years that
followed Fed Chairman Paul Volcker’s attempt to reduce inﬂation through tight
monetary policy.
Macroeconomic Policy and the Phillips Curve
We have addressed two of the questions about the Phillips curve raised earlier in
the chapter—the questions of why the Phillips curve was observed in historical
data and why it seemed to shift after 1970. We still must answer the third question:
Can the Phillips curve be thought of as a “menu” of inﬂation–unemployment com-
binations from which policymakers can choose? For example, can policymakers
reduce the unemployment rate by increasing the rate of inﬂation (moving up and
to the left along the Phillips curve)?
According to the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, unemployment will
fall below the natural rate only when inﬂation is unanticipated. So the question
becomes: Can macroeconomic policy be used systematically to create unanticipated
inﬂation?
Classical and Keynesian economists disagree on the answer to this question.
Classicals argue that wages and prices adjust quickly in response to new eco-

Vietnam War and increased social spending for the Great Society programs.

452 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
nomic information, including information about changes in government poli-
cies. Furthermore, classicals believe that people have rational expectations,
meaning that they make intelligent forecasts of future policy changes. Because
prices and price-level expectations respond quickly to new information, the
government can’t keep actual inflation above expected inflation—as would be
needed to drive unemployment below the natural rate—except perhaps for a
very short time. According to classicals, policies (such as more rapid monetary
expansion) that increase the growth rate of aggregate demand act primarily to
raise actual and expected inflation and so do not lead to a sustained reduction in
unemployment. Because any systematic attempt to affect the unemployment
rate will be thwarted by the rapid adjustment of inflation expectations, classicals
conclude that the Phillips curve does not represent a usable trade-off for policy-
makers. (”In Touch with Data and Research: The Lucas Critique,” p. 453,
explores a general lesson for policymakers of the shifting Phillips curve.)
In contrast, Keynesians contend that policymakers do have some ability—in
the short run, at least—to create unanticipated inﬂation and thus to bring unem-
ployment below the natural rate.
9
Although many Keynesians accept the notion
that people have rational expectations, they argue that the expected rate of inﬂation
that should be included in the expectations-augmented Phillips curve is the forecast
of inﬂation made at the time that the oldest sticky prices in the economy were set.
9
As we discussed in Chapter 11, Keynesian economists also believe that macroeconomic policy can
be used to return the unemployment rate to its natural level, if the economy starts out in a recession
or a boom.

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The Lucas Critique
Suppose that you observed, in a particular season, that the New York Giants of the
National Football League punted 100% of the time when faced with fourth down
in their own territory. Could you safely conclude, based on this empirical evi-
dence, that the Giants would punt on fourth down in their own territory next
season? In most cases, you probably could safely make this prediction, even if you
didn’t know anything about football. But what if, during the offseason, the rules
were changed to allow six attempts to make a ﬁrst down? Would you still expect
the Giants to follow historical precedent and punt on fourth down? Certainly no
one familiar with football would expect them to follow their old strategy, which
would be foolish under the new rules. The simple lesson from this example is that,
when the rules of the game change, people’s behaviors also change.*
In an inﬂuential article,
†
Robert E. Lucas, Jr., of the University of Chicago,
applied this lesson to macroeconomic policymaking. Frequently, in attempting to
forecast the effects of a new set of policies, economists and policymakers assume
that historical relationships between macroeconomic variables will continue to
hold after the new policies are in place. Lucas objected to this assumption, assert-
ing what has become known as the Lucas critique. According to the Lucas critique,
because new policies change the economic “rules” and thus affect economic behav-
ior, no one can safely assume that historical relationships between variables will
hold when policies change.
A good example of the Lucas critique in action is the shifting Phillips curve.
Historically, there seemed to be a stable relationship between inﬂation and unem-
ployment, which led some policymakers to believe that they could permanently
reduce unemployment by increasing inﬂation. However, as we have discussed,
when policymakers allowed inﬂation to rise, the public’s inﬂation expectations
also rose. As a result, the Phillips curve shifted and the historical relationship
between inﬂation and unemployment broke down.
The main message of the Lucas critique for economists is that, to predict the
effects of policy changes on the economy, they must understand how economic
behavior will change under the new policies. Understanding the impact of policy
changes on behavior—particularly the introduction of policies that haven’t been
tried before—requires the use of economic theory as well as empirical analysis.
*The example is from Thomas Sargent, Rational Expectations and Inﬂation, New York: Harper & Row,
1986, pp. 1–2.

Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 1, 1976.
Because of price stickiness, when policymakers cause aggregate demand to rise
above the expected level, time is needed for prices to fully reﬂect this new infor-
mation. In the meantime, some prices reﬂect older information, and the rate of
inﬂation is higher than the expected inﬂation rate based on this older information.
In response to increased inﬂation, therefore, unemployment may remain below the
natural rate for a while.

454 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
The Long-Run Phillips Curve
Although classicals and Keynesians disagree about whether the Phillips curve rela-
tionship can be exploited to reduce unemployment temporarily, they agree that
policymakers can’t keep the unemployment rate permanently below the natural
rate by maintaining a high rate of inﬂation. Expectations about inﬂation eventual-
ly will adjust so that the expected and actual inﬂation rates are equal, or .
The expectations-augmented Phillips curve (Eq. 12.1) implies that, when ,
the actual unemployment rate, u, equals the natural unemployment rate, . Thus
the actual unemployment rate equals the natural rate in the long run regardless of
the inﬂation rate maintained.
The long-run relationship of unemployment and inﬂation is shown by the
long-run Phillips curve. In the long run, because unemployment equals the natural
rate regardless of the inﬂation rate, the long-run Phillips curve is a vertical line at
, as shown in Fig. 12.8.
The vertical long-run Phillips curve is related to the long-run neutrality of money ,
discussed in Chapters 10 and 11. Classicals and Keynesians agree that changes in the
money supply will have no long-run effects on real variables, including unemploy-
ment. The vertical long-run Phillips curve carries the notion of monetary neutrality
one step further by indicating that changes in the growth rate of money , which lead to
changes in the inﬂation rate, also have no real effects in the long run.
12.2 The Problem of Unemployment
In the rest of the chapter we look more closely at unemployment and inﬂation, begin-
ning with unemployment in this section. We start by discussing the costs of unem-
ployment, then consider the factors that determine the long-run unemployment

level, and conclude by exploring some ways in which macroeconomic policy can
address unemployment.
The Costs of Unemployment
There are two principal costs of unemployment. The ﬁrst is the loss of output that
occurs because fewer people are productively employed. This cost is borne dis-
proportionately by unemployed workers themselves, in terms of the income they
lose because they are out of work. However, because the unemployed may stop
paying taxes and instead receive unemployment insurance beneﬁts or other gov-
ernment payments, society (in this case, the taxpayer) also bears some of the output
cost of unemployment.
How big is the output cost of unemployment? One estimate is provided by
Okun’s law (see Eq. 3.5), which states that each percentage point of cyclical
unemployment is associated with a loss equal to 2% of full-employment output.
Thus, if full-employment output is $14,000 billion, Okun’s law indicates that
each percentage point of unemployment sustained for one year reduces output
by $280 billion.
The loss of output predicted by Okun’s law reﬂects not only the direct impact
of increased unemployment, but also other labor market changes that occur during
recessions, such as shorter workweeks, reduced labor force participation, and lower
productivity (Numerical Problem 10 in Chapter 3 illustrates these effects). Thus the
output cost of unemployment estimated by Okun’s law probably is too high. Nev-
ertheless, an output loss that was only one-fourth of that predicted by Okun’s law
would still be a signiﬁcant cost, particularly if it were borne largely by the relatively
poor and disadvantaged members of society.
The other substantial cost of unemployment is the personal or psychological
cost faced by unemployed workers and their families. This cost is especially impor-
tant for workers suffering long spells of unemployment and for the chronically
unemployed. Workers without steady employment for long periods lose job skills
and self-esteem, and suffer from stress.
The costs of unemployment are real and serious, but two offsetting factors
should be noted. First, to the extent that unemployed workers engage in eco-
nomically productive activities such as searching for a job or acquiring new skills,
the loss of output arising from current unemployment may be compensated for
by increased output in the future. In particular, frictional unemployment—the
result of workers and ﬁrms seeking appropriate matches—raises future produc-
tivity and output and thus may impose little net economic cost, or even lead to an
economic gain.
A second offsetting factor is that unemployed people have more leisure time—
to spend with family and friends, work around the house, and so on. However, the
beneﬁts of extra leisure time decrease as the amount of leisure increases, and most
unemployed workers wouldn’t feel that increased leisure was adequate compen-
sation for their lost income.
The Long-Term Behavior of the Unemployment Rate
Classical and Keynesian economists agree that, although the actual unemploy-
ment rate may deviate from the natural unemployment rate in the short run, in the
long run the actual rate equals the natural rate. Thus understanding the behavior

of unemployment in all but the short run requires identifying the determinants of
the natural rate of unemployment. In Chapter 3 we discussed the reasons for the
natural unemployment rate always being greater than zero; here we focus more
narrowly on the reasons for changes in the natural rate in the United States.
The Changing Natural Rate. The natural unemployment rate corresponds to
full-employment output. Unfortunately, because we can’t be sure when the
economy is at full employment, we can’t directly observe the natural rate and so
must estimate it. Inevitably, therefore, there is some uncertainty about the value of
the natural rate at any particular time. Figure 12.9 shows estimated values of the
natural unemployment rate, published by the Congressional Budget Ofﬁce, along
with the actual unemployment rate, for the period 1960–2008. Most current
estimates, including those in Fig. 12.9, suggest a natural unemployment rate of
about 5% to 5.5% of the labor force, similar to or below what it was in the 1960s. In
contrast, in much of the 1970s and 1980s the natural rate was about 6% of the
labor force.
Giving a fully satisfactory explanation of the rise and fall in the natural rate of
unemployment is difﬁcult, but part of the story seems to have been the result of
demographic changes. The proportion of workers from differing demographic
groups (based on age, gender, or race) changes gradually over time. Because some
groups have higher unemployment rates than others, the natural rate of unem-
ployment changes over time. For example, in the 1960s, as women entered the
labor force in greater numbers, the natural rate of unemployment rose because
M12_ABEL4529_07_SE_C12.QXD  12/9/09  4:03 PM  Page 456
Chapter 12 Unemployment and Inﬂation 457
women’s average unemployment rate was higher than men’s.
10
Teenagers have
particularly high unemployment rates both because they move in and out of the
labor force frequently while in school and because many teenagers work at low-
skill jobs that do not provide long-term employment.
From World War II through about 1980, teenagers and women made up an
increasingly large portion of the labor force in the United States. This shift in the
composition of the labor force toward groups that have traditionally experienced
higher unemployment rates may have raised the overall unemployment rate
during that period, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. In contrast, since about
1980, demographic factors have tended to reduce the natural rate of unemploy-
ment. Most striking is the decline in recent decades in the share of young people in
the labor force—a trend that reﬂects the aging of the population as a whole. Indeed,
only about 16% of the U.S. labor force was aged sixteen to twenty-four in 1998,
compared to about 25% of the labor force in 1980. A study by Robert Shimer
11
of the
University of Chicago concluded that the declining share of unemployment-prone
younger workers can account for the bulk of the decline in the natural rate of
unemployment in the United States since 1980.
Some economists have been skeptical of estimates of the U.S. natural unem-
ployment rate in the range of 5% to 5.5%, noting that, at the end of the 1990s, the
U.S. unemployment rate remained close to 4% for a substantial period without gen-
erating inﬂation. They conclude that the natural rate must be 4.5% or even lower.
This disagreement illustrates the difﬁculty of obtaining precise estimates of the nat-
ural rate—an important problem for policymakers as well as for economists in
general. If the U.S. natural rate at the end of the millennium was as low as, say
4.5%, what explains this favorable development? One possibility is that the labor
market has become more efﬁcient at matching workers and jobs, thereby reducing
frictional and structural unemployment. For example, temporary help agencies
have become far more prominent in the United States in recent years. These agen-
cies specialize in helping ﬁrms ﬁll their temporary vacancies with qualiﬁed work-
ers. In many cases, these temporary jobs become permanent. If temporary help
agencies, Internet employment services, and other innovations have improved the
matching of workers and jobs, these developments might explain further declines
in the natural rate of unemployment.
12
Another possibility is that increased productivity of workers caused the natural
rate of unemployment to decline, especially in the second half of the 1990s. In
long-run equilibrium, the real wage paid to workers will equal their marginal pro-
ductivity. But there may be a lag between the time when productivity rises and the
time when real wages increase. For example, if real wages and productivity have
been growing at 2% per year for some time, and then productivity begins to grow
at 4% per year, workers accustomed to 2% real-wage growth may be slow to raise
their wage aspirations. With productivity growing faster than the real wage, ﬁrms
10
However, since the early 1980s, the average unemployment rates for men and women have been
about the same, so changes in the proportion of women in the labor force would no longer change 
the natural rate of unemployment.

Lawrence Katz of Harvard University and Alan Krueger of Princeton University argue that tempo-
rary help agencies may deserve credit for part of the falling natural rate. See their article “The High-

will hire more workers and the natural rate of unemployment will decline
temporarily.
13
Measuring the Natural Rate of Unemployment. Because of the prominent role
played by the natural rate of unemployment in economic theory, policymakers
would like to use measures of the natural rate when they formulate economic
policy. In simple terms, if policymakers observe that the unemployment rate is
above the natural rate, then the intersection of the AD and SRAS curves must be to
the left of the LRAS curve. Thus a policymaker might consider using expansionary
monetary policy (which we discuss in Chapter 14) or expansionary ﬁscal policy
(which we discuss in Chapter 15) to shift the AD curve to the right, to bring the
economy to its full-employment equilibrium. To use the unemployment rate as an
indicator for setting policy, however, the policymaker needs a good measure of the
natural rate of unemployment.
Although Fig. 12.9 shows a measure of the natural rate of unemployment cre-
ated by the Congressional Budget Ofﬁce (CBO), economists widely disagree about
how to measure the natural rate. In addition, even the CBO has often revised its
measures of the natural rate of unemployment over time.
14
Economists Douglas
Staiger of Dartmouth University, James Stock of Harvard University, and Mark
Watson of Princeton University
15
performed a detailed econometric analysis of
the precision with which the natural rate can be measured. They concluded that the
number could not be measured at all precisely, despite trying many alternative
methods of doing so. Their best estimate for the natural rate of unemployment in
1994, for example, is that it equaled , but that there was so much uncertainty
about the number that they were 95% conﬁdent that it was between 4.8% and
6.6%. That interval is far too large to be of any use to policymakers.
In the face of this evidence, researchers in the late 1990s pondered what policy-
makers should do. Given uncertainty about the natural rate of unemployment,
policymakers may want to be less aggressive with policy changes than they would
be if they knew the value of the natural rate more precisely.
16
Some researchers
have even blamed the rise of inﬂation in the 1970s on the Federal Reserve’s failure
to estimate the natural rate of unemployment properly.
17
Policymakers face the
problem, though, that measures of full-employment output may be even more
imprecise. So, although economic theory relies on the concepts of full-employment
output and the natural rate of unemployment, policymaking is difﬁcult because
economists cannot measure these concepts in a precise manner.

12.3 The Problem of Inflation
In August 1971 President Richard M. Nixon instituted a set of wage and price con-
trols in an attempt to reduce U.S. inﬂation. These strong measures were taken even
though the inﬂation rate was only 5% at the time. During the late 1970s, when the
U.S. inﬂation rate approached “double-digits,” surveys of voters found that they
thought inﬂation was “public enemy number one”; one victim of the public’s fear
of inﬂation was President Jimmy Carter, who lost his reelection bid to Ronald
Reagan in 1980 in part because of his perceived inability to control inﬂation. In this
section we look at inﬂation, beginning with a discussion of inﬂation costs and then
turning to the question of what can be done to control inﬂation.
The Costs of Inflation
The costs of inﬂation depend primarily on whether consumers, investors, workers,
and ﬁrms are able to predict the inﬂation before it occurs. To illustrate this point, we
discuss two extreme cases: an inﬂation that everyone is able to predict and an
inﬂation that comes as a complete surprise.
Perfectly Anticipated Inflation. Let’s ﬁrst consider the case of an inﬂation that
is perfectly anticipated by the public. Imagine, for example, that everyone knew
that the inﬂation rate would be 4% per year. To keep things simple, assume no
change in relative prices so that the prices of all individual goods and services
also are rising at the rate of 4% per year.
Why then does a fully anticipated inﬂation impose any costs? The prices you
pay for groceries, movie tickets, and other goods would increase by 4% per year but
so would your nominal wage or the nominal value of the goods or services you
produce. Because your nominal income is rising along with prices, your purchas-
ing power isn’t hurt by the perfectly anticipated inﬂation.
18
What about the money that you hold in your savings account? Although inﬂation
reduces the purchasing power of money, perfectly anticipated inﬂation wouldn’t
hurt the value of your savings account. The reason is that the nominal interest rate
would adjust to offset the drop in the purchasing power of money . For instance, with
a zero inﬂation rate and a nominal interest rate on savings deposits of 3%, the real
interest rate also is 3% per year. If inﬂation rises to a perfectly anticipated rate of 4%
per year, an increase in the nominal interest rate to 7% per year will leave the real inter-
est rate unchanged at 3%. Because both savers and banks care only about the real
interest rate, when inﬂation rises to 4% banks should be willing to offer 7% nominal
interest, and savers should be willing to accept that nominal return. Thus neither
banks nor savers are hurt by an anticipated increase in inﬂation.
19
18
It may be true that, psychologically, people think of increases in their wages arising from ongoing
inﬂation as being earned and thus “fair,” but that increases in the prices they pay because of inﬂation
are “unfair.” This is a confusion, although one that may have real political consequences if it causes
the public to demand strong action on inﬂation.
19
This argument ignores the fact that interest is taxed on a nominal basis. If the after-tax real interest
rate is to be kept constant, the nominal interest rate will have to rise by somewhat more than the
increase in inﬂation. See Section 4.1 on the after-tax real interest rate.

The suggestion that perfectly anticipated inﬂation imposes no economic costs
isn’t quite correct: Inﬂation erodes the value of currency, which leads people to
keep less currency on hand—for example, by going to the bank or the automatic
teller machine to make withdrawals every week instead of twice a month. Similarly ,
inﬂation may induce ﬁrms to reduce their cash holdings by introducing computer-
ized cash management systems or adding staff to the accounting department. The
costs in time and effort incurred by people and ﬁrms who are trying to minimize
their holdings of cash are called shoe leather costs. For modest inﬂation rates, shoe
leather costs are small but not completely trivial. For example, the shoe leather
costs of a 10% perfectly anticipated inﬂation have been estimated to be about 0.3%
of GDP , which is a little more than $40 billion per year in the United States.
20
A second cost of perfectly anticipated inﬂation arises from menu costs, or the
costs of changing nominal prices. When there is inﬂation and prices are continual-
ly rising, sellers of goods and services must use resources to change nominal prices.
For instance, mail-order ﬁrms have to print and mail catalogues frequently to
report the increases in prices. Although some ﬁrms face substantial menu costs, for
the economy as a whole these costs probably are small. Furthermore, technological
progress, such as the introduction of electronic scanners in supermarkets, reduces
the cost of changing prices.
Unanticipated Inflation. Much of the public’s aversion to inﬂation is aversion
to unanticipated inﬂation—inﬂation that is different from the rate expected. For
example, if everyone expects the inﬂation rate to be 4% per year, but it actually is
6% per year, unanticipated inﬂation is 2% per year.
What is the effect of 6% inﬂation if (1) you expected 4% inﬂation and (2) your
savings account pays 7% interest? When inﬂation is 6% per year instead of 4% per
year, the actual real interest rate on your savings account is only 1% per year (the
nominal interest rate of 7% minus the inﬂation rate of 6%) instead of the 3% per
year that you expected. By earning a lower actual real interest rate, you lose as a
result of the unanticipated inﬂation. However, your loss is the bank’s gain because
the bank pays a lower real interest rate than it expected. Note that the roles would
have been reversed if the actual inﬂation rate had been lower than expected; in that
case the real interest rate that you earn, and that the bank has to pay, would be
higher than anticipated.
Similarly, suppose that your nominal salary is set in advance. If inﬂation is
higher than expected, the real value of your salary is less than you expected, and
your loss is your employer’s gain. If inﬂation is lower than expected, however, you
beneﬁt and your employer loses.
These examples show that a primary effect of unanticipated inﬂation is to trans-
fer wealth from one person or ﬁrm to another. People who lend or save at ﬁxed
interest rates (creditors) and those with incomes set in nominal terms are hurt by
unanticipated inﬂation, whereas people who borrow at ﬁxed interest rates (debtors)
or who must make ﬁxed nominal payments are helped by unanticipated inﬂation.
For the economy as a whole, a transfer of wealth from one group to another
isn’t a net loss of resources and hence doesn’t represent a true cost. However, from
the viewpoints of individual people and ﬁrms in the economy, the risk of gaining or

Indexed Contracts
In principle, much of the risk of gains and losses associated with unanticipated
inﬂation can be eliminated by using contracts in which payments are indexed to
inﬂation. If a bank wanted to offer a guaranteed 3% real interest rate on savings
accounts, for instance, it could index the nominal interest rate to the rate of inﬂation
by offering to pay a nominal interest rate equal to 3% plus whatever the rate of
inﬂation turns out to be. Then if the actual inﬂation rate is 6%, the bank would end
up paying a nominal interest rate of 9%—giving the depositor the promised 3% real
interest rate. Similarly, other ﬁnancial contracts, such as loans, mortgages, and
bonds, can be indexed to protect the real rate of return against unanticipated inﬂa-
tion. Wage payments set by labor contracts can also be indexed to protect workers
and employers against unanticipated inﬂation (we discussed the macroeconomic
effects of wage indexation in Appendix 11.A).
How widespread is indexing? Most ﬁnancial contracts in the United States are
not indexed to the rate of inﬂation, although payments on some long-term ﬁnancial
contracts (adjustable-rate mortgages, for example) are indexed to nominal interest
rates such as the prime rate charged by banks or the Treasury bill interest rate.
Because nominal interest rates move roughly in step with inﬂation, these long-term
ﬁnancial contracts are to some extent indexed to inﬂation. Many labor contracts in
the United States are indexed to the rate of inﬂation through provisions called
cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs. They provide for some increase in nominal
wages if inﬂation is higher than expected, but usually a 1% increase in unantici-
pated inﬂation results in somewhat less than a 1% adjustment of wages. In January
1997 the U.S. Treasury began to sell bonds indexed to the rate of inﬂation.
In countries that have experienced high and unpredictable inflation rates,
indexed contracts are common. A case in point is Israel, which had a CPI inﬂation
rate of 445% per year in 1984. At that time, more than 80% of liquid ﬁnancial assets
in Israel were indexed: For example, long-term government bonds were indexed to
the CPI, and banks offered short-term deposits whose purchasing power was tied
to that of the U.S. dollar. However, the fraction of ﬁnancial assets that were indexed
decreased after the Israeli hyperinﬂation ended in the second half of 1985, and con-
tinued to decrease as Israeli inﬂation fell to single digits.*

losing wealth as a result of unanticipated inﬂation is unwelcome. Because most
people don’t like risk, the possibility of signiﬁcant gains or losses arising from
unexpected inﬂation makes people feel worse off and hence is a cost of unantici-
pated inﬂation. Furthermore, any resources that people use in forecasting inﬂation
and trying to protect themselves against the risks of unanticipated inﬂation repre-
sent an additional cost. However, some of these costs of unanticipated inﬂation can
be eliminated by contracts that are indexed to the price level, as we discuss in “In
Touch with Data and Research:  Indexed Contracts.”

462 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
Another cost of unanticipated inﬂation relates to the fact that prices serve as
signals in a market economy. For example, if wheat becomes more expensive than
corn, that is a signal to consumers to switch from wheat to corn and to farmers to
produce more wheat and less corn. However, the prices that act as signals in the
economy are relative prices, such as the price of wheat relative to the price of corn.
Knowing that wheat is so many dollars per bushel doesn’t help the consumer and
farmer make good economic decisions unless they also know the price of corn.
When inﬂation is unanticipated, particularly if it is erratic, people may confuse
changes in prices arising from changes in the general price level with changes in
prices arising from shifts in the supply or demand for individual goods. Because
the signals provided by prices may be distorted by unanticipated inﬂation, the
market economy works less efﬁciently. In addition, when there is a great deal of
uncertainty about the true inﬂation rate, people must spend time and effort learn-
ing about different prices, by comparison shopping, for example.
The Costs of Hyperinflation. Hyperinﬂation occurs when the inﬂation rate is
extremely high for a sustained period of time.
21
For example, during a twelve-
month period beginning in August 1945, the average rate of inﬂation in Hungary
was 19,800% per month.
22
In the more recent hyperinﬂation in Bolivia, the annual
rate of inﬂation was 1281% in 1984, and soared to 11,750% in 1985, before
dropping to 276% in 1986.
23
The costs of inﬂation during these hyperinﬂations
were much greater than the costs associated with moderate inﬂation. For
example, when prices are increasing at such mind-boggling rates, the incentives
to minimize holdings of currency are powerful and the resulting shoe leather
costs are enormous. In severe hyperinﬂations, workers are paid much more
frequently—perhaps even more than once a day—and they rush out to spend
their money (or to convert their money into some other form, such as a foreign
currency) before prices rise even further. The time and energy devoted to getting
rid of currency as fast as possible wastes resources and disrupts production.
One early casualty of hyperinﬂations is the government’s ability to collect
taxes. In a hyperinﬂation, taxpayers have an incentive to delay paying their taxes
as long as possible. Because tax bills usually are set in nominal terms, the longer the
taxpayer delays, the less the real value of that obligation is. The real value of taxes
collected by the government falls sharply during hyperinﬂations, with destructive
effects on the government’s ﬁnances and its ability to provide public services.
Finally, the disruptive effect of inﬂation on market efﬁciency that we discussed
earlier becomes most severe in the case of a hyperinﬂation. If prices change so
often that they cease to be reliable indicators of the supply and demand for differ-
ent goods and services, the invisible hand of the free market can’t allocate resources
efﬁciently.
21
Philip Cagan, in his classic study of hyperinﬂation (“The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinﬂation,” in
Milton Friedman, ed., Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money, Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1956), deﬁned a hyperinﬂation as beginning in the month in which the rate of inﬂation ﬁrst exceeds
50% per month.

Fighting Inflation: The Role of Inflationary Expectations
Basically, inﬂation occurs when the aggregate quantity of goods demanded at any
particular price level is rising more quickly than the aggregate quantity of goods
supplied at that price level. (Figure 12.3 illustrates such a situation.) Many factors
can cause rapid increases in the aggregate quantity of goods demanded relative to
the aggregate quantity supplied. Among these sources of inﬂation are increases in
consumption or investment spending, expansionary ﬁscal policies, and adverse
supply shocks. However, as discussed in Chapter 7, in general the only factor that
can create sustained rises in aggregate demand, and thus ongoing inﬂation, is a high
rate of money growth.
If rapid money growth is inﬂationary, why do central banks permit rapid
monetary expansion? As mentioned in Chapter 7 (and discussed in more detail in
Chapter 15), in developing or war-torn countries governments may not be able to
raise enough revenue by taxing or borrowing, so they print money to ﬁnance
their spending. However, in industrialized countries not engaged in or recover-
ing from a war, governments usually are able either to tax or borrow enough to
cover their expenditures. In these countries, rapid money growth usually is the
result of attempts to use expansionary monetary policy to ﬁght recessions, not
balanced by tighter monetary policies in periods when output is above its full-
employment level.
Because ongoing inﬂation generally is the result of rapid money growth, the
prescription for stopping inﬂation appears to be simple: Reduce the rate of money
growth. Unfortunately, the process of disinﬂation—the reduction of the inﬂation
rate—by slowing money growth may lead to recession. In terms of the expectations-
augmented Phillips curve, Eq. 12.1, if macroeconomic policy succeeds in reducing
inﬂation below the expected rate, unemployment will rise above the natural rate.
Unemployment will remain above the natural rate until expected inﬂation falls to
the new, lower actual inﬂation rate.
Is there some way to reduce inﬂation without incurring serious unemployment
costs? The expectations-augmented Phillips curve suggests one possibility: If the
public’s expected rate of inﬂation could be lowered as actual inﬂation was being
brought down, unemployment wouldn’t have to rise above the natural rate. (You
should conﬁrm that, in Eq. 12.1, if actual inﬂation, p, and expected inﬂation, p
e
, fall
by the same amount, cyclical unemployment, , doesn’t increase.) That is, if
expected inﬂation can be reduced, the original Phillips curve relating inﬂation and
unemployment can be shifted down and to the left, reducing the rate of inﬂation
associated with any level of unemployment.
But how can policymakers reduce the public’s inﬂationary expectations? In the
rest of this section we discuss some suggested approaches for reducing both inﬂa-
tion and inﬂationary expectations.
Rapid Versus Gradual Disinflation. Some classical economists have proposed
that disinﬂation should be implemented quickly by a rapid and decisive reduction
in the growth rate of the money supply—a strategy sometimes referred to as cold
turkey. Because a cold-turkey disinﬂation is dramatic and highly visible to the
public, proponents of this policy argue that it will quickly and substantially reduce
inﬂationary expectations, particularly if the policy is announced well in advance. If
expected inﬂation falls sufﬁciently, the expectations-augmented Phillips curve
implies that the unemployment costs of the disinﬂation will be minimal.

464 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
However, most Keynesian economists disagree with the idea that rapid
disinflation can be achieved without significant costs in terms of increased
cyclical unemployment. They argue that because of factors such as menu costs
and nominal wage contracts, several years may be required for prices and
wages to adjust to a disinflationary policy; during the adjustment period cycli-
cal unemployment could be high. Furthermore, Keynesians point out that the
cold-turkey strategy may not lower inflation expectations, because people may
expect the government to abandon the policy if the resulting unemployment
reaches politically intolerable levels.
Because they fear the possible unemployment consequences of the cold-turkey
strategy, many Keynesians recommend a policy of gradualism, or reducing the rate
of money growth and inﬂation gradually over a period of years. Keynesians argue
that a gradual approach, which gives prices, wages, and expectations more time to
adjust to the disinﬂation, will raise the unemployment rate by less than the cold-
turkey strategy—although the period during which unemployment exceeds the
natural rate may be longer. They further argue that, because the policy will be
viewed as sustainable politically, gradualism may be as effective as the cold-turkey
approach at reducing inﬂationary expectations. The results of one study comparing
cold turkey and gradualism are discussed in ”In Touch with Data and Research:
The Sacriﬁce Ratio.”
Wage and Price Controls. Frustrated by the costs and difﬁculties of reducing
inﬂation by reducing money growth, policymakers in some countries have taken
a more direct approach and imposed wage and price controls—legal limits on the
ability of ﬁrms to raise wages or prices. Supporters of wage–price controls (or of
incomes policies, as wage–price controls are also called) argue that by using the
force of law to stop price increases the government can “break the back” of
inﬂationary expectations, allowing the disinﬂation to proceed without serious
unemployment consequences.
Critics of price controls make two points. First, price controls are likely to
cause shortages. In a free market the ever-changing forces of supply and
demand lead to changes in relative prices, with the prices of some products
rising more rapidly than the prices of others. If price controls prevent the
price of a product from rising to the level at which quantity supplied equals
quantity demanded, there will be excess demand for the product—that is, a
shortage. These shortages and the disruptions they cause are a major cost of
price controls.
Second, critics dispute that wage–price controls have a major effect on the
public’s inﬂation expectations. Although controls stop inﬂation for the moment,
because they cause shortages and disrupt the economy they eventually have to be
removed. Knowing that the controls are temporary, people may expect even greater
inﬂation in the future.
The most recent U.S. experience with price controls occurred in the early 1970s.
President Nixon imposed price controls from August 1971 to April 1974 in an
attempt to prevent inﬂation from rising higher than 5%. But shortages arose for
many goods, including chicken broilers, lumber, and various steel products. And
when the price controls were lifted, prices returned to the levels they would have
attained had the controls never been put in place.
One factor that may affect expectations of inﬂation during the period of con-
trols is how the government handles monetary and ﬁscal policy. If macroeconomic

The Sacrifice Ratio
To reduce inﬂation, tight monetary and ﬁscal policies must be used to slow the
growth rate of aggregate demand. However, if these policies aren’t perfectly antici-
pated, they will also cause output and employment to fall below their full-
employment levels—at least for a time. This loss of output and jobs is an important
cost that must be weighed against the beneﬁts of inﬂation-reducing policies.
Economists sometimes use the sacriﬁce ratio to measure the cost of lowering the
inﬂation rate. The sacriﬁce ratio is the amount of output lost when the inﬂation rate
is reduced by one percentage point. For example, according to a study by Laurence
Ball of Johns Hopkins University ,
†
during the disinﬂation of the early 1980s the inﬂa-
tion rate in the United States fell by 8.83 percentage points (from a rate of 12.10% per
year to 3.27% per year). For the ﬁfteen quarters of this disinﬂation, Ball estimated the
total loss in output caused by inﬂation-reducing policies to be 16.18% of one year’s
potential GDP . Dividing the output loss of 16.18% of potential GDP by the 8.83 per-
centage point reduction in inﬂation yields a sacriﬁce ratio of 1.832 for this episode. We
can interpret this result as saying that each percentage point by which U.S. inﬂation
was reduced during the early 1980s cost the country 1.832% of a year’s potential GDP .
Using quarterly data for nine countries, Ball calculated the sacriﬁce ratio for
twenty-eight disinﬂations that occurred during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The
accompanying table reports the average sacriﬁce ratio he found for each country
and demonstrates that the output cost of reducing inﬂation may vary considerably.
The average sacriﬁce ratio ranges from less than 1.0 in France, the United Kingdom,
and Japan to almost 3.0 in Germany. In other words, reducing inﬂation in Germany
is three times as expensive, in terms of lost output, than it is in those other indus-
trialized countries. What accounts for these differences?
By comparing the characteristics of the different countries in his sample, Ball
found that one factor affecting the sacriﬁce ratio is the ﬂexibility of the labor market.
Countries in which wages adjust relatively slowly to changes in labor supply and
demand—owing, for example, to heavy government regulation of the labor market—
tend to have higher sacriﬁce ratios. This ﬁnding makes sense because countries with
inﬂexible labor markets should take longer to reach long-run equilibrium following an

policies allow aggregate demand to continue to grow rapidly, people may expect
renewed inﬂation when the controls are lifted (see Analytical Problem 5 at the end
of the chapter). This failure to reduce aggregate demand growth appears to have
been the problem with the Nixon wage–price controls that began in 1971. But if
controls are accompanied by tight monetary and ﬁscal policy, the idea that inﬂation
will not resume when controls are lifted is more plausible.
Credibility and Reputation. Classicals and Keynesians agree that, for disinﬂation
to be achieved without high unemployment costs, reducing the public’s expected
inﬂation rate is important. Perhaps the most important factor determining how
quickly expected inﬂation adjusts is the credibility, or believability, of the
government’s announced disinﬂationary policy. If the government (in the person of
the President or the chairman of the Federal Reserve, for example) announces a
policy to reduce the inﬂation rate—and if workers, consumers, and ﬁrms believe
that the government means what it says—expected inﬂation should drop fairly
rapidly.
How can a government improve its credibility with the public? One desirable
way would be for the government to develop a reputation for carrying through on
its promises; then when it announced a disinﬂation program, people would likely
take this announcement seriously. Unfortunately, time is needed to develop such a
reputation, and changes in administration may lead to relatively frequent changes
in the people who make policy decisions.
Another strategy is to organize policymaking institutions in ways that create
credibility with the public. For example, a strong and independent central bank, run
by someone with well-known anti-inﬂation views, may have credibility with the
public when it announces a disinﬂationary policy . However, if the central bank is con-
trolled directly by the executive branch—and is therefore exposed to intense political
pressure when unemployment rises—an announced disinﬂationary program is likely
to be less credible. We explore the relationship among institutional structure, gov-
ernment credibility, and inﬂation expectations in greater detail in Chapter 14.
The U.S. Disinflation of the 1980s and 1990s
Theories about disinﬂation were put to the test in the 1980s and 1990s in the United
States. Beginning in 1979 under Paul Volcker and continuing in 1987 under Alan
unexpected slowing of the growth of aggregate demand. Ball also found that rapid
disinﬂations tend to have lower sacriﬁce ratios than do slow disinﬂations, which is a
bit of evidence in favor of the cold-turkey approach rather than gradualism.
Ball’s results are interesting but should be interpreted with some caution. One
problem is that determining exactly how much output loss can be attributed to a par-
ticular set of anti-inﬂationary policies isn’t easy . For example, to calculate the output
loss owing to disinﬂation we have to estimate the amount of output if there had been
no disinﬂation, which is difﬁcult. If the output loss calculation is wrong, the sacriﬁce
ratio calculation will also be wrong. Factors such as supply shocks, which affect both
output and inﬂation, can also distort the calculation of sacriﬁce ratios. Thus, at best,
the sacriﬁce ratio is a rough measure of the costs of reducing inﬂation.

Greenspan, the Federal Reserve sought to eliminate inﬂation as a major source of
economic instability. From 1979 to 1982, Chairman Volcker reduced inﬂation from
double-digit levels to about 4%. From 1982 on, Volcker and Greenspan together
gradually reduced the inﬂation rate. Their goal was to keep inﬂation from being a
major consideration in the minds of consumers and investors. They wanted inﬂa-
tion to be at such a low and stable rate that it would no longer worry people and
they would have conﬁdence that it would never rise substantially again.
One way to judge the success of the Federal Reserve is to examine people’s
inﬂation expectations. To do so, we use inﬂation forecasts from the Survey of Pro-
fessional Forecasters, collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, as
shown in Fig. 12.10. The graph shows sharp swings up and down prior to about
1990. After that, the expected inﬂation rate follows a gradual downward trend
until about 1998 and has been fairly stable since then.
The Fed’s disinﬂation process, beginning in 1979, was at ﬁrst a bit unstable,
perhaps because the Fed had failed to curb inﬂation during the 1970s and the
newly appointed Fed chairman, Paul Volcker, had not yet established his credibil-
ity. As a result, inﬂation expectations did not decline immediately when inﬂation
fell. Over the decade, as people came to accept the Fed’s desire to reduce inﬂation,
the Fed gained credibility. The period since 1990, characterized by gradualism,
was accompanied by a slow, steady drop in inﬂation expectations. By the time
Greenspan left ofﬁce in 2006 and Ben Bernanke took over, the Fed’s credibility was
well established. The fact that inﬂation expectations barely increased in the period
from 2004 to 2008, despite large increases in oil prices, suggests that the Fed’s rep-
utation and credibility are well established.

1. Following the famous 1958 article by A. W. Phillips,
empirical studies often showed that inﬂation is high
when unemployment is low and low when unem-
ployment is high. This negative empirical relation-
ship between inﬂation and unemployment is called
the Phillips curve. Inﬂation and unemployment in the
United States conformed to the Phillips curve during
the 1960s but not during the 1970s and 1980s.
2. Economic theory suggests that, in general, the nega-
tive relationship between inﬂation and unemployment
should not be stable. Instead, in an economy in which
there are unanticipated changes in the growth rate of
aggregate demand, there should be a negative rela-
tionship between unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical
unemployment. In particular, when actual and expected
inﬂation are equal (so that unanticipated inﬂation is
zero), the actual unemployment rate will equal the
natural unemployment rate (so that cyclical unem-
ployment is zero). This negative relationship between
unanticipated inﬂation and cyclical unemployment is
called the expectations-augmented Phillips curve.
3. According to the theory of the expectations-augmented
Phillips curve, a stable negative relationship between
inﬂation and unemployment (a Phillips curve) will be
observed only if expected inﬂation and the natural
unemployment rate are constant. An increase in
expected inﬂation or an increase in the natural unem-
ployment rate shifts the Phillips curve up and to the
right. Adverse supply shocks typically increase both
expected inﬂation and the natural unemployment rate
and thus shift the Phillips curve up and to the right.
Major supply shocks during the 1970s, a rising natural
unemployment rate, and highly variable expected
inﬂation rates explain why the Phillips curve shifted
erratically in the United States after about 1970.
4. According to the expectations-augmented Phillips
curve, macroeconomic policy can reduce unemploy-
ment below the natural rate only by surprising the
public with higher-than-expected inﬂation. Classical
economists argue that, because of rational expecta-
tions and rapid price adjustment, policy cannot be
used systematically to create inflation higher than
expected; thus policymakers cannot usefully exploit
the Phillips curve relationship by trading higher
inflation for lower unemployment. Keynesians
believe that, because not all prices adjust rapidly to
reflect new information, policymakers are able to
create surprise inﬂation temporarily and thus trade
off inﬂation and unemployment in the short run.
5. Classicals and Keynesians agree that, in the long run,
expected and actual inﬂation rates are equal. Thus in
the long run the actual unemployment rate equals
the natural rate, regardless of the inflation rate.
Reﬂecting the fact that there is no long-run trade-off
between inﬂation and unemployment, the long-run
Phillips curve is vertical at the natural unemploy-
ment rate.
6. The costs of unemployment include output lost when
fewer people are working and the personal or psy-
chological costs for unemployed workers and their
families.
7. In the long run the unemployment rate is determined
by the natural unemployment rate. According to some
estimates, the natural unemployment rate in the
United States rose during the 1960s and 1970s but has
since declined. Demographic changes in the labor
force help to explain many of these changes. However,
although policymakers would like to have a precise
estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, econo-
mists have been unable to measure it very precisely.
8. The costs of inﬂation depend on whether the inﬂation
was anticipated or unanticipated. The costs of antici-
pated inﬂation, which (except in extreme inﬂations)
are relatively minor, include shoe leather costs
(resources used by individuals and ﬁrms to reduce
their holdings of currency) and menu costs (costs of
changing posted prices during an inﬂation). Unan-
ticipated inﬂation causes unpredictable transfers of
wealth among individuals and firms. The risk of
unpredictable gains and losses, and the resources
that people expend in trying to reduce this risk, are
costs of unanticipated inﬂation. Unanticipated inﬂa-
tion may also reduce the efficiency of the market
system by making it more difficult for people to
observe relative prices.
9. Disinflation is a reduction in the rate of inflation.
Attempts to disinﬂate by slowing money growth will
cause cyclical unemployment to rise if actual inﬂa-
tion falls below expected inflation. To reduce the
unemployment cost of disinflation, the public’s
expected inflation rate should be brought down
along with the actual inflation rate. Strategies for
reducing expected inﬂation include rapid and deci-
sive reduction in the growth rate of the money
supply (the cold-turkey approach), wage and price
controls, and taking measures to improve the credi-
bility of government policy announcements.
10. The disinﬂation that occurred in the United States in
the 1980s and 1990s was costly at ﬁrst because expect-
ed inﬂation did not decline immediately. But as time
passed and the Federal Reserve gained credibility,
inﬂation expectations declined, along with inﬂation.

b. The government program is expensive, and crit-
ics argue that a cheaper way to cut unemploy-
ment would be by monetary expansion.
Comment.
2. Two extended classical economies (in which the mis-
perceptions theory holds) differ only in one respect: In
economy A money growth and inﬂation have been low
and stable for many years, but in economy B money
growth and inflation have fluctuated erratically
between very low and very high levels. When produc-
ers in economy B observe changes in the prices of the
goods they produce, from past experience they usually
attribute these changes to ﬂuctuations in the overall
price level rather than to changes in the relative prices
of their goods.
Will the slope of the short-run aggregate supply
curve for economy B be ﬂatter or steeper than the slope
of the curve for economy A? What about the slope of the
Phillips curve?
3. In this problem you are asked to show that the expec-
tations-augmented Phillips curve (derived in the text
using the extended classical model) can be derived
using the Keynesian model.
Consider a Keynesian economy in which full-
employment output is constant, and in which the
nominal money supply has been growing at 10% per
year for some time and is expected to keep growing at
that rate in the future. To avoid some technical com-
plications, suppose that, instead of growing continu-
ously over time, the money supply is increased by
10% each December 31 and then held constant until
the next December 31. Monopolistically competitive
ﬁrms reset their prices on December 31 of each year at
the level that they expect will allow them to sell the
full-employment level of output during the coming
year. Inﬂation is measured as the percentage change in
prices between January 1 and December 31 of each
year.
a. Show how the AD curve, SRAS curve, output, the
price level, and the expected price level evolve
over time in this economy. What are the values of
unanticipated inflation and cyclical unemploy-
ment?
b. Now suppose that on June 30, 2010, the money
supply is unexpectedly raised by an additional 5%.
However, the central bank announces—and firms
believe—that this extra increase in the money
supply is a one-time-only increase and that next
December 31 the central bank will return to its
policy of increasing the money supply by 10%.
(Thus the total increase in the money supply
between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2010, is
15%.) Firms don’t change prices until December
31, as usual, but when they do they respond fully
to the new information about money supply
growth.
What are the actual and unanticipated inﬂation rates
during 2010? Is cyclical unemployment positive,
negative, or zero (on average) during 2010? Relate
your results to the expectations-augmented Phillips
curve.
4. Some economists have suggested that someday we will
live in a “cashless society” in which all businesses
(including stores) and banks will be linked to a cen-
tralized accounting system. In this system you will be
able to pay for purchases directly from your bank
account without using cash. What are the costs of antic-
ipated inﬂation in a cashless society? What are the costs
of unanticipated inﬂation?
5. To fight an ongoing 10% inflation, the government
makes raising wages or prices illegal. However, the gov-
ernment continues to increase the money supply (and
hence aggregate demand) by 10% per year. The econo-
my starts at full-employment output, which remains
constant.
a. Using the Keynesian AD–AS framework, show the
effects of the government’s policies on the econo-
my. Assume that ﬁrms meet the demand at the ﬁxed
price level.
b. After several years in which the controls have kept
prices from rising, the government declares victory
over inﬂation and removes the controls. What hap-
pens?
6. How would each of the following likely affect the nat-
ural unemployment rate?
a. A new law prohibits people from seeking employ-
ment before age eighteen.
b. A new Internet service, Findwork.com, makes it easy
for people to check on the availability of jobs around
the country.
c. The length of time that unemployed workers can
receive government benefits increases from six
months to one year.
d. A shift in the public’s buying habits greatly expands
the demand for sophisticated consumer electronics
while reducing the demand for traditional con-
sumer goods and services, such as clothing and
restaurant meals.
e. Tight monetary policy, introduced to get the inﬂa-
tion rate down, drives the economy into a recession.

WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. Using annual data since 1956, create scatter plots of the
following variables:
a. CPI inﬂation rate (December to December) against the
average unemployment rate for the year. (Note: You
may wish to use the data converter that is available on
this textbook’s Web site, www.pearsonhighered.com/abel,
to calculate the CPI each December.)
b. CPI inﬂation rate against the cyclical unemploy-
ment rate. (The cyclical unemployment rate is the
actual unemployment rate minus the natural
unemployment rate, where the natural unemploy-
ment rate is measured by the nonaccelerating inﬂa-
tion rate of unemployment, NAIRU, which can be
found at the Web site of the Congressional Budget
Office, www.cbo.gov; look under the listing for
“Budget and Economic Information” for the latest
version of the “Budget and Economic Outlook”.)
c. Change in the CPI inﬂation rate from the previous
year against the cyclical unemployment rate.
Discuss your results in light of the theory of the
Phillips curve.
2. In this exercise, you are going to examine the historical
data on Okun’s Law, which we used in our discussion
of the costs of unemployment. The level form of
Okun’s Law in Eq. (3.5) states that the output gap,
, equals cyclical unemployment, , multi- u - u q

plied by 2. First, get the Congressional Budget Ofﬁce’s
quarterly estimates of the natural rate of unemploy-
ment and real potential GDP from their Web site at
www.cbo.gov/Spreadsheets.html, and then look for a link
to “Key Assumptions in CBO’s Projection of Potential
Output” and note that the natural rate is called NAIRU
in some places on their Web site. Second, collect quar-
terly data on real GDP from the FRED database in each
quarter beginning in 1960, and then use it with the
CBO potential output data series to calculate the
output gap at each date. Third, download monthly
data on the unemployment rate from the FRED data-
base beginning in 1960, and then take the quarterly
average of the data using the data converter on this
textbook’s Web site (www.pearsonhighered.com/abel). Use
those quarterly data and the CBO’s natural rate series
to calculate cyclical unemployment. Fourth, draw a
graph of the output gap (on the vertical axis) versus
cyclical unemployment (on the horizontal axis). Also,
on the same set of axes, draw a straight line through
the origin with a slope of 2. Do the data points lie close
to this line?
3. For each year since 1948, calculate the share of total
unemployment accounted for by people unem-
ployed for fifteen weeks or more. How is this ratio
related to the business cycle (for peak and trough
dates, see Table 8.1), and to the overall unemploy-
ment rate? What are the implications of these results
for a policymaker who wants to assess the costs of a
recession?

CHAPTER 13
Exchange Rates, Business
Cycles, and Macroeconomic
Policy in the Open Economy
In Chapters 9–12 we focused on a closed economy, or one that doesn’t interact with
other economies. For some purposes, ignoring the foreign sector simpliﬁes the
analysis. But the reality is that today, more than ever, we live in a highly interde-
pendent world economic system.
There are two primary aspects of the interdependence of the world’s
economies. The first is international trade in goods and services, which has
increased steadily in volume since World War II. Today, ﬁrms produce goods and
services with an eye on foreign and domestic markets, and they obtain many raw
materials from distant sources. Expanded international trade has increased pro-
ductivity by allowing economies to specialize in producing the goods and services
best suited to their natural and human resources. However, expanded trade also
implies that national economies are more dependent on what happens in other
countries. For example, because Japan sells so much of its output to the United
States, a U.S. recession or macroeconomic policy change may affect the Japanese
economy as well. In the fourth quarter of 2008, during the ﬁnancial crisis, U.S.
GDP declined 5% (at an annual rate), causing a sharp decline in imports from
Japan, which contributed to a 12% decline (at an annual rate) in Japan’s GDP .
The second is the worldwide integration of ﬁnancial markets, which allows
borrowers to obtain funds and savers to look for their best lending opportunities
almost anywhere in the world, not just in their own countries. By allowing saving to
ﬂow to the highest-return uses regardless of where savers and investors happen to
live, the integration of world ﬁnancial markets increases worldwide productivity , as
does the development of an integrated world trading system. But ﬁnancial market
linkages, like trade linkages, increase the sensitivity of individual economies to
developments abroad. For example, because of closely connected ﬁnancial mar-
kets, macroeconomic policies that change the real interest rate in one country may
affect real interest rates and economic activity in other countries. When U.S. real
interest rates declined sharply and turned negative during the ﬁnancial crisis in
2008, real interest rates in many other countries declined similarly as well.
In this chapter, we build on earlier analyses of the open economy (Chapter 5)
and cyclical ﬂuctuations (Chapters 8–11) to examine the macroeconomic implica-
tions of trading and ﬁnancial links among countries. We are particularly concerned
M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:48 AM  Page 473
474 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
in this chapter with how economic openness affects ﬁscal and monetary policies
and how macroeconomic policy changes affect the economies of a country’s trad-
ing partners. We begin our discussion by introducing two new variables that play
central roles in the international economy: the nominal exchange rate and the real
exchange rate.
13.1 Exchange Rates
In discussing exchange rates, we must distinguish between nominal and real
exchange rates. Brieﬂy stated, the nominal exchange rate is the answer to the
question: How many units of a foreign currency can I get in exchange for one unit
of my domestic currency? The real exchange rate is the answer to the question:
How many units of the foreign good can I get in exchange for one unit of my
domestic good?
Nominal Exchange Rates
Most countries have their own national currencies: The U.S. dollar, the Japanese
yen, the British pound, and the Swiss franc are but a few well-known currencies.
(Exceptions include a number of European countries, which use the euro as their
common currency, and Panama, which uses U.S. dollars as its ofﬁcial currency.) If
someone in one country wants to buy goods, services, or assets from someone in
another country, normally she will ﬁrst have to exchange her country’s currency for
that of her trading partner’s country.
The rate at which two currencies can be traded is the nominal exchange rate
between the two currencies. For example, if the nominal exchange rate between the
U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen is 90 yen per dollar, a dollar can buy 90 yen (ignor-
ing transaction fees) in the foreign exchange market, which is the market for inter-
national currencies. Equivalently, 90 yen can buy 1 dollar in the foreign exchange
market. More precisely, the nominal exchange rate between two currencies, e
nom
, is
the number of units of foreign currency that can be purchased with one unit of the
domestic currency . For residents of the United States the domestic currency is the U.S.
dollar, and the nominal exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen
is expressed as yen per dollar. The nominal exchange rate often is simply
called the exchange rate, so whenever someone mentions the exchange rate without
specifying real or nominal, the reference is taken to mean the nominal exchange rate.
The dollar–yen exchange rate isn’t constant. The dollar might trade for 90 yen
one day, but the next day it might rise in value to 92 yen or fall in value to 88 yen.
Such changes in the exchange rate are normal under a flexible-exchange-rate
system, the type of system in which many of the world’s major currencies (includ-
ing the dollar and the yen) are currently traded. In a ﬂexible-exchange-rate system,
or ﬂoating-exchange-rate system, exchange rates are not ofﬁcially ﬁxed but are
determined by conditions of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.
Under a ﬂexible-exchange-rate system, exchange rates move continuously and
respond quickly to any economic or political news that might inﬂuence the sup-
plies and demands for various currencies. “In Touch with Data and Research:
Exchange Rates,” p. 484, discusses exchange rate data.
The values of currencies haven’t always been determined by a ﬂexible-exchange-
rate system. In the past, some type of ﬁxed-exchange-rate system under which
e
nom
= 90
M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:48 AM  Page 474
Chapter 13 Exchange Rates, Business Cycles, and Macroeconomic Policy in the Open Economy 475
exchange rates were set at ofﬁcially determined levels, often operated. Usually , these
ofﬁcial rates were maintained by the commitment of nations’ central banks to buy
and sell their own currencies at the ﬁxed exchange rate. For example, under the
international gold standard system that operated in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the
central bank of each country maintained the value of its currency in terms of gold by
agreeing to buy or sell gold in exchange for currency at a ﬁxed rate of exchange. The
gold standard was suspended during World War I, was temporarily restored in the
late 1920s, and then collapsed during the economic and ﬁnancial crises of the 1930s.
A more recent example of a ﬁxed-exchange-rate system was the Bretton Woods
system, named after the town in New Hampshire where the 1944 conference estab-
lishing the system was held. Under the Bretton Woods system, the values of various
currencies were ﬁxed in terms of the U.S. dollar, and the value of the dollar was set at
$35 per ounce of gold. The Bretton Woods system functioned until the early 1970s,
when inﬂation in the United States made keeping the price of gold from rising above
$35 per ounce virtually impossible. Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system,
no ﬁxed-exchange-rate system has encompassed all the world’s major currencies. In
particular, U.S. policymakers haven’t attempted to maintain a ﬁxed value for the dollar.
Although no worldwide system of ﬁxed exchange rates currently exists, ﬁxed
exchange rates haven’t disappeared entirely. Many individual countries, especially
smaller ones, attempt to ﬁx their exchange rates against a major currency . For exam-
ple, several African countries tie their currencies to the euro, and from 1991 to 2002,
Argentina used a system under which its currency , the peso, traded one-for-one with
the U.S. dollar. By ﬁxing their exchange rates, countries hope to stabilize their own
currencies and reduce the sharp swings in import and export prices that may result
from exchange rate ﬂuctuations. We discuss ﬁxed exchange rates in Section 13.5.
Real Exchange Rates
The nominal exchange rate doesn’t tell you all you need to know about the pur-
chasing power of a currency. If you were told, for example, that the nominal
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen is 90 yen per dollar, but
you didn’t know anything else about the U.S. or Japanese economies, you might be
tempted to conclude that someone from Kansas City could visit Tokyo very
cheaply—after all, 90 yen for just 1 dollar seems like a good deal. But even at 90 yen
per dollar, Japan is an expensive place to visit. The reason is that, although 1 dollar
can buy a lot of yen, it also takes a lot of yen (thousands or hundreds of thousands)
to buy everyday goods in Japan.
Suppose, for example, that you want to compare the price of hamburgers in
Tokyo and Kansas City. Knowing that the exchange rate is 90 yen per dollar doesn’t
help much. But if you also know that a hamburger costs 2 dollars in Kansas City
and 900 yen in Tokyo, you can compare the price of a hamburger in the two cities
by asking how many dollars are needed to buy a hamburger in Japan. Because a
hamburger costs 900 yen in Tokyo, and 90 yen cost 1 dollar, the price of a ham-
burger in Tokyo is 10 dollars (calculated by dividing the price of a Japanese ham-
burger, ¥900, by ¥90/$1, to obtain $10 per hamburger). The price of a U.S.
hamburger relative to a Japanese hamburger is therefore ($2 per U.S. hamburger)/
($10 per Japanese hamburger) = 0.20 Japanese hamburgers per U.S. hamburger. The
Japanese hamburger is expensive in the sense that (in this example) one U.S. ham-
burger equals only one-ﬁfth of a Japanese hamburger.

The price of domestic goods relative to foreign goods—equivalently , the number
of foreign goods someone gets in exchange for one domestic good—is called the real
exchange rate. In the hamburger example the real exchange rate between the United
States and Japan is 0.20 Japanese hamburgers per U.S. hamburger.
In general, the real exchange rate is related to the nominal exchange rate and to
prices in both countries. To write this relation we use the following symbols:
the nominal exchange rate 
(90 yen per dollar);
the price of foreign goods, measured in the foreign currency 
(900 yen per Japanese hamburger);
the price of domestic goods, measured in the domestic currency 
(2 dollars per U.S. hamburger).
The real exchange rate, e, is the number of foreign goods (Japanese hamburgers)
that can be obtained in exchange for one unit of the domestic good (U.S. hamburgers).
The general formula for the real exchange rate is
(13.1)
In deﬁning the real exchange rate as the number of foreign goods that can be
obtained for each domestic good, we assume that each country produces a single,
unique good. (Think of France producing only bottles of wine and Saudi Arabia pro-
ducing only barrels of oil; then the French real exchange rate with respect to Saudi
Arabia is the number of barrels of oil that can be purchased for one bottle of wine.) The
assumption that each country produces a single good (which is different from the
good produced by any other country) simpliﬁes the theoretical analysis in this chapter.
1
Of course, in reality countries produce thousands of different goods, so real
exchange rates must be based on price indexes (such as the GDP deﬂator) to mea-
sure P and . Thus the real exchange rate isn’t actually the rate of exchange
between two speciﬁc goods but instead is the rate of exchange between a typical
basket of goods in one country and a typical basket of goods in the other country.
Changes in the real exchange rate over time indicate that, on average, the goods of
the country whose real exchange rate is rising are becoming more expensive rela-
tive to the goods of the other country.
Appreciation and Depreciation
When the nominal exchange rate, falls so that, say , a dollar buys fewer units of
foreign currency , we say that the dollar has undergone a nominal depreciation. This
is the same as saying that the dollar has become “weaker.” If the dollar’s nominal

The assumption that different countries produce different goods is a change from Chapter 5, where
we implicitly assumed that all countries produce an identical good that can be used for all purposes
(consumption, investment, and so on). The assumption that all countries produce the same good
implied that, in the analysis of that chapter, the real exchange rate was always 1.

SUMMARY 15
Terminology for Changes in Exchange Rates
2
You will sometimes see the exchange rate deﬁned as the number of units of domestic currency per
unit of foreign currency, which is the reciprocal of how we have deﬁned it. For example, the exchange
rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar is typically quoted in this form (for example, $1.60
per pound). Under this alternative deﬁnition an appreciation of the dollar corresponds to a drop in
the nominal exchange rate. The two ways of deﬁning the exchange rate are equally valid as long as
consistency is maintained. We have chosen to deﬁne the exchange rate as the number of units of for-
eign currency per unit of home currency because it is easier to remember that an appreciation (when
the value of the dollar goes up) is associated with a rise in the exchange rate.
exchange rate, e
nom
, rises, the dollar has had a nominal appreciation. When the
dollar appreciates, it can buy more units of foreign currency and thus has become
“stronger.”
2
The terms appreciation and depreciation are associated with ﬂexible
exchange rates. Under a ﬁxed-exchange-rate system, in which exchange rates are
changed only by ofﬁcial government action, different terms are used. Instead of a
depreciation, a weakening of the currency is called a devaluation. A strengthening
of the currency under ﬁxed exchange rates is called a revaluation, rather than an
appreciation. These terms are listed for convenience in Summary table 15.
An increase in the real exchange rate, e, is called a real appreciation. With a real
appreciation, the same quantity of domestic goods can be traded for more of the
foreign good than before because e, the price of domestic goods relative to the
price of foreign goods, has risen. A drop in the real exchange rate, which decreas-
es the quantity of foreign goods that can be purchased with the same quantity of
domestic goods, is called a real depreciation.
Purchasing Power Parity
How are nominal exchange rates and real exchange rates related? A simple hypo-
thetical case that allows us to think about this question is when all countries pro-
duce the same good (or same set of goods) and goods are freely traded among
countries. In this case, no one would trade domestic goods for foreign goods except
on a one-for-one basis, so (ignoring transportation costs) the real exchange rate, e,
would always equal 1. If , we can use Eq. (13.1) to write
(13.2)
Equation (13.2) says that the price of the domestic good must equal the price of
the foreign good when the price of the foreign good is expressed in terms of the
domestic currency. (To express the foreign price in terms of the domestic currency,
divide by the exchange rate.) The idea that similar foreign and domestic goods, or
baskets of goods, should have the same price in terms of the same currency is
called purchasing power parity (PPP). Equivalently, as implied by Eq. (13.2),

purchasing power parity says that the nominal exchange rate should equal the for-
eign price level divided by the domestic price level, so that
There is some empirical evidence that PPP holds in the very long run, but (as ”In
Touch with Data and Research: McParity” suggests) over shorter periods PPP does not
describe exchange rate behavior very well. The failure of PPP in the short to medium
run occurs for various reasons. For example, countries produce very different baskets
of goods and services, not the same goods as assumed for PPP; some types of goods,
and most services, are not internationally traded; and transportation costs and legal
barriers to trade may prevent the prices of traded goods and services from being
equalized in different countries.

If PPP holds, similar goods produced in different countries should cost about the
same when their prices are expressed in a common currency—say, U.S. dollars. As
a test of this hypothesis, The Economist magazine has long recorded the prices of Big
Mac hamburgers in different countries. The following are dollar prices of Big Macs
in selected countries as reported in The Economist’s July 16, 2009, issue.
Big Macs aren’t exactly the same product the world over. For example, in Italy,
ketchup costs about ﬁfty cents extra, instead of being included in the price as in the
United States and Canada. Nevertheless, the prices suggest that PPP holds only
approximately at best for Big Macs. Dollar-equivalent Big Mac prices range from a
low of $1.83 in China to a high of $5.98 in Switzerland.
Even though PPP fails to hold exactly, Big Mac prices in different countries still
might be expected to come gradually closer together. Such a convergence could
occur, for example, if the currencies in countries in which Big Macs are relatively
expensive depreciated relative to the currencies of the countries in which Big Macs
are cheap. Such a calculation would suggest that the Brazilian real, the euro, and the
Swiss franc are likely to depreciate in value relative to the dollar (because Big Macs
are most expensive in those countries). In contrast, the Big Mac index suggests that
the Chinese yuan, the Malaysian ringgit, and the Russian ruble may appreciate.

To ﬁnd a relationship between real and nominal exchange rates that holds
more generally, we can use the deﬁnition of the real exchange rate in Eq. (13.1), 
to calculate the percentage change in the real exchange rate.
Because the real exchange rate is expressed as a ratio, its percentage change equals
the percentage change in the numerator minus the percentage change in the
denominator.
3
The percentage change in the numerator of the expression for the
real exchange rate

is and the percentage change in the
denominator is Thus the percentage change in the real exchange rate is
In the preceding equation the term the percentage change in the domes-
tic price level, is the same as the domestic rate of inflation π, and the term
the percentage change in the foreign price level, is the same as the for-
eign rate of inﬂation, . Making these substitutions and rearranging the equa-
tion, we rewrite this equation as
(13.3)
Equation (13.3) is purely deﬁnitional and thus must always be satisﬁed. It
states that the rate of nominal exchange rate appreciation, , equals the
rate of real exchange rate appreciation, plus the excess of foreign inﬂation
over domestic inﬂation, Hence two factors contribute to strengthening a
currency (a nominal appreciation): (1) an increase in the relative price of a country’s
exports (a real appreciation), which might occur if, for example, foreign demand for
those exports rises; and (2) a rate of domestic inﬂation, p, lower than that of the
country’s trading partners, .
A special case of Eq. (13.3) occurs when the real exchange rate is constant, so
that
In this case, the preceding equation expresses a relationship called relative pur-
chasing power parity. According to relative purchasing power parity, the rate of
appreciation of the nominal exchange rate equals the foreign inﬂation rate minus
the domestic inﬂation rate. Relative purchasing power parity usually works well
for high-inﬂation countries because in those countries, changes in relative inﬂation
rates are usually much larger than changes in the real exchange rate.
The Real Exchange Rate and Net Exports
We’ve deﬁned the real exchange rate, but so far we haven’t indicated why it is
important in macroeconomic analysis. One reason that policymakers and the public
care about the real exchange rate is that it represents the rate at which domestic

480 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
goods and services can be traded for those produced abroad. An increase in the real
exchange rate—also sometimes referred to as the terms of trade—is good for a
country in the sense that its citizens are able to obtain more foreign goods and ser-
vices in exchange for a given amount of domestic production.
A second reason is that the real exchange rate affects a country’s net exports, or
exports less imports. Changes in net exports in turn have a direct impact on the
domestic industries that produce for export or that compete with imported goods
in the domestic market. In addition, as we discuss later in the chapter, changes in
net exports affect a country’s overall level of economic activity and are a primary
channel through which business cycle disturbances and macroeconomic policy
changes are transmitted internationally.
What is the link between the real exchange rate and net exports? A basic deter-
minant of the demand for any good or service—say, coffee or taxi rides—is the
price of that good or service relative to alternatives. If the price of coffee is too high,
some people will switch to tea; if taxi fares rise, more people will take the bus. Sim-
ilarly, the real exchange rate—the price of domestic goods relative to foreign
goods—helps determine the demand for domestic goods both in home and foreign
markets.
Suppose that the real exchange rate is high, so that a unit of the domestic good
can buy relatively many units of the foreign good. For example, let’s say that a
domestically produced car costs twice as much as a comparable foreign car (both
prices are measured in terms of the same currency). Domestic residents will then
ﬁnd that foreign cars are less expensive than domestic cars, so (all else being equal)
their demand for imported autos will be high. Foreign residents, in contrast, will
ﬁnd that the domestic country’s cars are more expensive than their own, so they
will want to purchase relatively few of the domestic country’s exports. With few
cars being sold abroad and many cars being imported, the country’s net exports of
cars will be low, probably even negative.
Conversely, suppose that the real exchange rate is low; for example, imagine
that a domestically produced automobile costs only half what a comparable foreign
car costs. Then, all else being equal, the domestic country will be able to export rel-
atively large quantities of cars and will import relatively few, so that its net exports
of cars will be high.
The general conclusion, then, is that the higher the real exchange rate is, the lower
a country’s net exports will be, holding constant other factors affecting export and
import demand. The reason for this result is the same reason that higher prices
reduce the amount of coffee people drink or the number of taxi rides they take.
Because the real exchange rate is the relative price of a country’s goods and ser-
vices, an increase in the real exchange rate induces both foreigners and domestic
residents to consume less domestic production and more goods and services pro-
duced abroad, which lowers net exports.
The J Curve. Although the conclusion that (holding other factors constant) a
higher real exchange rate depresses net exports is generally valid, there is one
important qualiﬁcation: Depending on how quickly importers and exporters
respond to changes in relative prices, the effect of a change in the real exchange rate
on net exports may be weak in the short run and may even go the “wrong” way.
To understand why, consider a country that imports most of its oil and sud-
denly faces a sharp increase in world oil prices. Because the country’s domestic
goods now can buy less of the foreign good (oil), the country’s real exchange rate
M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:48 AM  Page 480
Chapter 13 Exchange Rates, Business Cycles, and Macroeconomic Policy in the Open Economy 481
has fallen. In the long run, this decline in the real exchange rate may increase the
country’s net exports because high oil prices will lead domestic residents to reduce
oil imports and the relative cheapness of domestic goods will stimulate exports (to
oil-producing countries, for example). In the short run, however, switching to other
fuels and increasing domestic oil production are difﬁcult, so the number of barrels
of oil imported may drop only slightly. For this reason, and because the real cost of
each barrel of oil (in terms of the domestic good) has risen, for some period of time
after the oil price increase the country’s total real cost of imports (measured in
terms of the domestic good) may rise. Thus, in the short run, a decline in the real
exchange rate might be associated with a drop rather than a rise in net exports, con-
trary to our earlier conclusion. (Numerical Problem 2 at the end of the chapter pro-
vides an example of how a real depreciation can cause net exports to fall.)
Figure 13.1 shows the typical response pattern of a country’s net exports to a
drop in the real exchange rate (a real depreciation). The economy initially has neg-
ative net exports when the real exchange rate depreciates. In the short run, the real
depreciation reduces rather than increases net exports because the drop in the real
exchange rate forces the country to pay more for its imports. Over time, however, as
the lower real exchange rate leads to larger export quantities and smaller import
quantities, net exports begin to rise (even taking into account the higher relative cost
of imports). Eventually , the country’s net exports rise relative to the initial situation.
This typical response pattern of net exports to a real depreciation is called the J curve
because the graph of net exports against time looks like the letter J lying on its back.
The macroeconomic analyses in this chapter are based on the assumption that
the time period is long enough that (all else being equal) a real depreciation
increases net exports and that a real appreciation reduces net exports. Keep in
mind, though, that this assumption may not be valid for shorter periods—and in
some cases, even for several years—as the following application demonstrates.
Figure 13.1

response pattern of net

when the real exchange

as the decline in the real

sured in terms of the
export good). Over time,

quantities of imports

APPLICATION
The Value of the Dollar and U.S. Net Exports
In the early 1970s, the major industrialized countries of the world switched from
ﬁxed to ﬂexible exchange rates. Figure 13.2 shows the U.S. real exchange rate (the
“real value of the dollar”) and real U.S. net exports since 1973. Because the U.S. real
exchange rate is the relative price of U.S. goods, the real value of the dollar and U.S.
net exports should move in opposite directions (assuming that changes in the real
exchange rate are the primary source of changes in net exports).
An apparent conﬁrmation that the real exchange rate and net exports move in
opposite directions occurred during the early 1980s. From 1980 to 1985, the real value
of the dollar increased by about 50%. This sharp increase was followed, with a brief
delay, by a large decline in U.S. net exports. At the time, many U.S. ﬁrms complained
that the strong dollar was pricing their products out of foreign markets and, by
making imported goods cheap for U.S. consumers, also reducing their sales at home.
After peaking in March 1985, the real value of the dollar fell sharply for almost
three years. Despite this precipitous decline, U.S. net exports continued to fall until
late in 1987, when they ﬁnally began to rise. During the two and a half years in
which U.S. net exports continued to decline despite the rapid depreciation of the
dollar, the public and policymakers expressed increasing skepticism about econo-
mists’ predictions that the depreciation would lead to more net exports. Initially,
economists responded by saying that, because of the J curve, there would be some
delay between the depreciation of the dollar and the improvement in net exports.
By 1987, however, even the strongest believers in the J curve had begun to wonder
whether net exports would ever begin to rise. Finally, U.S. real net exports did
recover substantially, although they remained negative.
What took so long? One explanation suggests that, because the dollar was so
strong in the ﬁrst half of the 1980s (which made U.S. goods very expensive relative
to foreign goods), U.S. ﬁrms lost many of their foreign customers. Once these for-
eign customers were lost, regaining them or adding new foreign customers was dif-
ﬁcult, especially as many U.S. exporters reduced production capacity and cut back
foreign sales operations when the value of the dollar was high. Similarly, the strong
dollar gave foreign producers, including some that hadn’t previously sold their
output to the United States, a chance to make inroads into the U.S. domestic
market. Having established sales networks and customer relationships in the
United States, these foreign companies were better able than before to compete
with U.S. ﬁrms when the dollar began its decline in 1985. The idea that the strong
dollar permanently increased the penetration of the U.S. market by foreign pro-
ducers, while similarly reducing the capability of American ﬁrms to sell in foreign
markets, has been called the “beachhead effect.”
5
The U.S. real exchange rate and U.S. net exports moved in opposite directions
again from 1997 to 2001, as the dollar strengthened and net exports fell sharply. In
part this decline in net exports reﬂected the higher value of the dollar. However, the
major factor in this episode was probably the slow growth or outright recession
experienced by most U.S. trading partners during this period. As incomes abroad

Empirical support for the beachhead effect is presented in Richard E. Baldwin, “Hysteresis in Import
Prices: The Beachhead Effect,” American Economic Review, September 1988, pp. 773–785.

stagnated or declined, the demand for U.S. exports fell with them. We discuss the
effects of national income on imports and exports in the next section.
After reaching a peak in early 2002, the dollar weakened for the next six years.
It took some time for net exports relative to GDP to reverse course and begin rising,
but this ratio ﬁnally began to rise in 2006 and continued doing so until 2008. Then,
in the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, investors’ loss of conﬁdence throughout the world led
them to buy dollar-denominated assets for safety, causing the dollar to appreciate
sharply. At the same time, the fall in U.S. income caused imports to decline
sharply—by more than the decline in foreign income reduced U.S. exports—so
that U.S. net exports increased.

13.2 How Exchange Rates Are Determined: A Supply-and-Demand Analysis
In flexible-exchange-rate systems, exchange rates change constantly. In fixed-
exchange-rate systems, by deﬁnition, exchange rates are stable most of the time;
even under a ﬁxed-rate system, large devaluations or revaluations aren’t uncom-
mon. What economic forces cause a nation’s exchange rate to rise or fall? In this sec-
tion we address this question by using supply and demand to analyze the
determination of exchange rates in a ﬂexible-exchange-rate system (we return to
ﬁxed exchange rates in Section 13.5).
For clarity, our supply-and-demand analysis focuses on the nominal exchange
rate rather than the real exchange rate. However, recall from Eq. (13.1) that, for
given levels of domestic and foreign prices, the real exchange rate and the nominal

Exchange Rates
Exchange rates are determined in foreign exchange markets, in which the curren-
cies of different countries are traded. Principal foreign exchange markets are
located in New York, London, Tokyo, and other ﬁnancial centers. Because foreign
exchange markets are in widely separated time zones, at least one of the markets is
open at almost any time of the day, so trading in currencies essentially takes place
around the clock.
Exchange rates among major currencies often are reported daily on radio and
television, and daily quotations of exchange rates are printed in major newspapers
and ﬁnancial dailies. The exchange rates in the accompanying table were reported
in the Wall Street Journal on August 21, 2009, and apply to transactions of August
20, 2009.
Four exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar are reported in the table for
each country: a spot rate and three forward rates. All are expressed as units of
foreign currency per U.S. dollar. The spot rate is the rate at which foreign currency
can be traded immediately for U.S. dollars. For instance, the spot exchange rate for
Great Britain, 0.6057, means that on August 20, 2009, one U.S. dollar could buy
0.6057 pounds for immediate delivery.
Forward exchange rates are prices at which you can agree now to buy foreign
currency at a speciﬁed date in the future. For example, on August 20, 2009, you
could have arranged to buy or sell Japanese yen 30 days later at an exchange rate
of 94.18 yen per dollar. Note that for the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, the 30-day
forward exchange rate is lower than the spot exchange rate and that forward
exchange rates decrease for dates farther into the future (90 days and 180 days).
This pattern of falling forward rates indicates that, as of August 20, 2009, partici-
pants in the foreign exchange market expected the value of the dollar relative to the
Swiss franc and the yen to decrease over the next six months. For the exchange rate
between the British pound and the dollar, notice that the spot rate is equal to all of
the forward rates, so that participants in the foreign exchange market believe that
the exchange rate will remain stable at its current level.

all our conclusions about the nominal exchange rate apply equally to the real exchange rate.
The nominal exchange rate, e
nom
, is the value of a currency—say, the dollar. The
value of the dollar, like that of any asset, is determined by supply and demand in
the relevant market. For dollars, the relevant market is the foreign exchange

market, where banks and currency traders continuously trade dollars for other
currencies.

e
nom
. The supply curve for dollars, S, shows the number of dollars that people want
to supply to the foreign exchange market at each “price” (nominal exchange rate).
To supply dollars to the foreign exchange market means to offer to exchange dollars
for some other currency . When the dollar’s value in terms of other currencies is high,
people are more willing to supply dollars to the market; thus the supply curve
slopes upward. Similarly, the demand curve for dollars, D, shows the quantity of
dollars that people want to buy in the foreign exchange market at each exchange
rate. When the dollar is more expensive in terms of other currencies, people demand
fewer dollars, so the demand curve slopes downward. The equilibrium value of the
dollar at point E is , the exchange rate at which the quantity of dollars supplied
and the quantity of dollars demanded are equal.
Figure 13.3 helps explain the forces that determine the value of the dollar, or
any other currency. To go any further, though, we must ask why people decide to
demand or supply dollars. Unlike apples or haircuts, dollars aren’t demanded
because people value them in themselves; rather, people value dollars because of
what they can buy. Speciﬁcally, foreign individuals or ﬁrms demand dollars in the
foreign exchange market for two reasons:
1. to be able to buy U.S. goods and services (U.S. exports), and
2. to be able to buy U.S. real and ﬁnancial assets (U.S. ﬁnancial inﬂows).

Note that the two types of transactions for which foreigners need dollars
(to purchase U.S. exports and U.S. assets) correspond to the two major components
of the balance of payments accounts: the current account and the ﬁnancial account.
6
Similarly, U.S. residents supply dollars to the foreign exchange market, there-
by acquiring foreign currencies, for two reasons:
1. to be able to buy foreign goods and services (U.S. imports), and
2. to be able to buy real and ﬁnancial assets in foreign countries (U.S. ﬁnancial
outﬂows).
Thus factors that increase foreigners’ demand for U.S. exports and assets will also
increase the foreign-exchange-market demand for dollars, raising the dollar exchange
rate. Likewise, the value of the dollar will rise if U.S. residents’ demand for foreign
goods and assets declines, so they supply fewer dollars to the foreign exchange market.
For example, suppose that U.S. goods improve in quality so that foreigners
demand more of them. This increase in the demand for U.S. exports would trans-
late into an increase in the demand for U.S. dollars. In Fig. 13.4 the demand for dol-
lars shifts to the right, from D
1
to D
2
, and the equilibrium value of the dollar rises
from to . All else being equal, then, improvements in the quality of U.S.
goods would lead to an appreciation of the dollar.

Macroeconomic Determinants of the Exchange Rate 
and Net Export Demand
In our previous IS–LM analyses we emphasized two key macroeconomic vari-
ables: real output (income), Y, and the real interest rate, r. In anticipation of the
open-economy version of the IS–LM model presented in Section 13.3, we now con-
sider how changes in real output or the real interest rate (either at home or abroad)
are linked to the exchange rate and net exports. Again, because we are holding
domestic and foreign price levels constant, the results we discuss here apply
equally to the nominal exchange rate and the real exchange rate.
Effects of Changes in Output (Income). Imagine that domestic output (equivalently ,
domestic income), Y, increases but that other factors (such as the real interest rate)
remain unchanged. How would the increase in Y affect the exchange rate and net
exports?
To consider the effect on net exports ﬁrst is easier. We know that spending by
consumers depends in part on their current incomes. When domestic income rises,
consumers will spend more on all goods and services, including imports. Thus,
e

An improvement in the quality of U.S. goods may also lead U.S. residents to substitute U.S. goods
for foreign goods, thereby reducing U.S. imports, and reducing the supply of dollars in the foreign
exchange market at each real exchange rate. This leftward shift of the supply curve reinforces the con-
clusion in the text that the dollar appreciates.
6
We deﬁned and discussed the current account and the ﬁnancial account in Chapter 5. Throughout
this chapter we ignore the capital account, the third component of the balance of payments, because it
is so small. The idea that foreigners must hold dollars to buy U.S. goods or assets isn’t completely
accurate, because many transactions between the United States and foreigners are done without
anyone ever literally holding a supply of dollars or the foreign currency. Nevertheless, this way of
thinking about the determination of exchange rates is fairly simple and gives the same answers as
would a more complex analysis.

when domestic output (income) rises, net exports (exports minus imports) must
fall, other factors held constant.

To determine the effect of increased domestic output on the exchange rate,
recall that, to increase their purchases of imports, domestic residents must obtain
foreign currencies. Equivalently, domestic residents must supply more domestic
currency to the foreign exchange market. An increased supply of domestic curren-
cy causes its value to fall; that is, the exchange rate depreciates.
We can also analyze the effects of an increase in the real output of the country’s
trading partners, (foreign output or income). An increase in leads foreign
consumers to increase their spending on all goods and services, including the
exports of the domestic country. Thus an increase in the income of Germany and
Japan, for example, would increase those nations’ demand for U.S. exports and
raise U.S. net exports. The increase in foreign demand for U.S. goods also would
increase foreigners’ demand for U.S. dollars, raising the value of the dollar. Note
that the effects of changes in foreign income are the opposite of the effects of
changes in domestic income.
Effects of Changes in Real Interest Rates. A second key macroeconomic
variable to be considered is the real interest rate. Imagine that the domestic
country’s real interest rate, r, rises, with other factors (including the foreign real

The conclusion that an increase in output reduces net exports seems to contradict a result obtained in
Chapter 5—that an increase in output owing to a beneﬁcial supply shock raises net exports. There is
no contradiction because a supply shock doesn’t hold variables other than output constant as we are
assuming here. See Analytical Problem 4 at the end of the chapter.

interest rate) held constant.
9
In this case, the country’s real and ﬁnancial assets will
become more attractive to both domestic and foreign savers seeking the highest
return on their funds. Because domestic currency can be used to buy domestic
assets, a rise in the domestic real interest rate also increases the demand for and
reduces the supply of domestic currency. An increased demand and decreased
supply of domestic currency in turn leads to exchange rate appreciation.
A rise in the domestic real interest rate, r, has no direct effect on net exports, but
it does have an indirect effect through the exchange rate. An increase in r raises the
exchange rate so that domestic exports become more expensive and imports from
abroad become cheaper. Thus, other factors being constant, an increase in r reduces
the domestic country’s net exports.
The effects of a change in the foreign real interest rate, r
For
, are the opposite of
the effects of a change in the domestic real interest rate. If the foreign real interest
rate rises, for example, foreign assets will become more attractive to domestic and
foreign savers. To get the foreign currency needed to buy foreign assets, domestic
savers will supply domestic currency to the foreign exchange market. Foreign
savers will also demand less domestic currency. The increased supply and
decreased demand for domestic currency will lead to a depreciation of the
exchange rate. The depreciation of the exchange rate caused by the rise in r
For
in
turn raises the domestic country’s net exports.
Summary tables 16 and 17 list the effects of the various macroeconomic factors
on the exchange rate and net exports.
9
Note that, by holding the foreign real interest rate constant, we no longer assume (as we did in
Chapter 5) that the domestic and foreign countries face the same world real interest rate. In general,
real interest rates in different countries need not be the same when countries produce different goods,
as we assume in this chapter. The reason is that real interest rates in different countries measure dif-
ferent things. For example, the Japanese real interest rate measures the growth of an asset’s purchas-
ing power in terms of Japanese goods, whereas the German real interest rate measures the growth of
an asset’s purchasing power in terms of German goods. If the Japanese–German real exchange rate is
changing, the two real interest rates need not be the same.

13.3 The IS–LM Model for an Open Economy
Now we’re ready to explore how exchange rates and international trade interact
with the behavior of the economy as a whole. To do so, we extend the IS–LM
model to allow for trade and lending among nations. An algebraic version of this
analysis is presented in Appendix 13.B. We use the IS–LM diagram rather than the
AD–AS diagram because we want to focus on the real interest rate, which plays a
key role in determining exchange rates and the ﬂows of goods and assets.
Recall that the components of the IS–LM model are the IS curve, which
describes goods market equilibrium; the LM curve, which describes asset market
equilibrium; and the FE line, which describes labor market equilibrium. Nothing
discussed in this chapter affects our analysis of the supply of or demand for money
in the domestic asset market; so, in developing the open-economy IS–LM model,
we use the same LM curve that we used for the closed-economy model. Similarly,
the labor market and the production function aren’t directly affected by interna-
tional factors, so the FE line also is unchanged.
10
However, because net exports are part of the demand for goods, we have to
modify the IS curve to describe the open economy. Three main points need to be
made about the IS curve in the open economy:
1. Although the open-economy IS curve is derived somewhat differently than
the closed-economy IS curve, it is a downward-sloping relationship between
output and the real interest rate, as the closed-economy IS curve is.
2. All factors that shift the IS curve in the closed economy shift the IS curve in the
open economy in the same way.
3. In an open economy, factors that change net exports also shift the IS curve.
Speciﬁcally, for given values of domestic output and the domestic real interest
10
A case in which the FE line does depend on international considerations is when some raw materi-
als (such as oil) are imported. In this book we have modeled oil price shocks as productivity shocks,
which captures the main domestic macroeconomic effects. A full analysis that includes all the interna-
tional aspects of an oil price shock is complex, so we don’t present it here.

rate, factors that raise a country’s net exports shift the open-economy IS curve
up and to the right; factors that lower a country’s net exports shift the IS
curve down and to the left.
After discussing each point, we use the open-economy IS–LM model to analyze
the international transmission of business cycles and the operation of macroeco-
nomic policies in an open economy.
The Open-Economy IS Curve
For any level of output the IS curve gives the real interest rate that brings the
goods market into equilibrium. In a closed economy, the goods market equilibrium
condition is that desired national saving, , must equal desired investment, , or
In an open economy, as we showed in Chapter 5, the goods market
equilibrium condition is that desired saving, S
d
, must equal desired investment, 
plus net exports, NX. Writing the goods market equilibrium condition for an open
economy, we have
(13.4)
To interpret Eq. (13.4), recall that S
d
- I
d
, the excess of national saving over invest-
ment, is the amount that domestic residents desire to lend abroad. Recall also that
net exports, NX (which, if net factor payments and net unilateral transfers are zero,
is the same as the current account balance), equals the amount that foreigners want
to borrow from domestic savers. Thus Eq. (13.4) indicates that, for the goods market
to be in equilibrium, the amount that domestic residents desire to lend to foreigners
must equal the amount that foreigners desire to borrow from domestic residents.
Equivalently, we can write the goods market equilibrium condition as
(13.5)
We obtained Eq. (13.5) from Eq. (13.4) by replacing desired saving, , with its def-
inition, and rearranging. Equation (13.5) states that the goods market
is in equilibrium when the supply of goods, Y, equals the demand for goods, 
Note that in an open economy the total demand for goods includes
spending on net exports.
Figure 13.5 illustrates goods market equilibrium in an open economy. The hor-
izontal axis measures desired saving minus desired investment, S
d
- I
d
, and net
exports, NX. Note that the horizontal axis includes both positive and negative
values. The vertical axis measures the domestic real interest rate, r.
The upward-sloping curve, shows the difference between desired
national saving and desired investment for each value of the real interest rate, r.
This curve slopes upward because, with output held constant, an increase in the
real interest rate raises desired national saving and reduces desired investment,
raising the country’s desired foreign lending.
The downward-sloping curve, NX, in Fig. 13.5, shows the relationship between
the country’s net exports and the domestic real interest rate, other factors held
constant. As discussed in Section 13.2, a rise in the real interest rate appreciates the
exchange rate, which in turn reduces net exports (see Summary table 17, p. 489).
Hence the NX curve slopes downward.
Goods market equilibrium requires that the excess of desired saving over
desired investment equal net exports (Eq. 13.4). This condition is satisﬁed at the

intersection of the and NX curves at point E. Thus the domestic real interest
rate that clears the goods market is the interest rate at E,or .
To derive the open-economy IS curve, we need to know what happens to the
real interest rate that clears the goods market when the current level of domestic
output rises (see Fig. 13.6). Suppose that domestic output initially equals and
that goods market equilibrium is at point E, with a real interest rate of . Now sup-
pose that output rises to . An increase in current output raises desired national
saving but doesn’t affect desired investment, so the excess of desired saving over
desired investment rises at any real interest rate. Thus the curve measuring the
excess of desired saving over desired investment shifts to the right, from 
to in Fig. 13.6(a).
What about the NX curve? An increase in domestic income causes domestic
consumers to spend more on imported goods, which (other factors held constant)
reduces net exports (Summary table 17, p. 489). Thus, when output rises from Y
1
to
Y
2
, net exports fall, and the NX curve shifts to the left, from NX
1
to NX
2
.
After the increase in output from Y
1
to Y
2
, the new goods market equilibrium is
at point F in Fig. 13.6(a), with the real interest rate at r
2
. The IS curve in Fig. 13.6(b)
shows that, when output equals Y
1
, the real interest rate that clears the goods market
is r
1
; and that when output equals Y
2
, the real interest rate that clears the goods
market is r
2
. Because higher current output lowers the real interest rate that clears the
goods market, the open-economy IS curve slopes downward, as for a closed economy .
Factors That Shift the Open-Economy IS Curve
As in a closed economy, in an open economy any factor that raises the real interest
rate that clears the goods market at a constant level of output shifts the IS curve up.
This point is illustrated in Fig. 13.7 which shows the effects on the open-economy

IS curve of a temporary increase in government purchases. With output held con-
stant at Y
1
, the initial equilibrium is at point E, where the real interest rate is r
1
. A
temporary increase in government purchases lowers desired national saving at
every level of output and the real interest rate. Thus the curve shifts to the
left, from to , as shown in Fig. 13.7(a). The new goods market equi-
librium is at point F, where the real interest rate is r

Figure 13.7(b) shows the effect on the IS curve. For output Y

In general, any factor that shifts the closed-economy IS curve up does so by
reducing desired national saving relative to desired investment. Because a change
that reduces desired national saving relative to desired investment shifts the
S - I curve to the left (Fig. 13.7a), such a change also shifts the open-economy IS
curve up.

and causing the NX curve to shift to the left, from NX

In addition to the standard factors that shift the IS curve in a closed economy,
some new factors affect the position of the IS curve in an open economy. In partic-
ular, anything that raises a country’s net exports, given domestic output and the
domestic real interest rate, will shift the open-economy IS curve up. This point is
illustrated in Fig. 13.8.
At the initial equilibrium point, E, in both Figs. 13.8(a) and (b), domestic output
is Y
1
and the domestic real interest rate is r
1
. Now suppose that some change raises
the country’s net exports at any level of domestic output and the domestic real
interest rate. This increase in net exports is shown as a shift to the right of the NX
curve in Fig. 13.8(a), from NX
1
to NX
2
. At the new goods market equilibrium point,
F, the real interest rate has risen to r
2
. Because the real interest rate that clears the
goods market has risen for constant output, the IS curve shifts up and to the right,
as shown in Fig. 13.8(b), from IS
1
to IS
2
.
What might cause a country’s net exports to rise, for any given domestic output
and domestic real interest rate? We’ve discussed three possibilities at various points
in this chapter: an increase in foreign output, an increase in the foreign real interest
M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:48 AM  Page 493

rate, and a shift in world demand toward the domestic country’s goods (see Sum-
mary table 17, p. 489).
■ An increase in foreign output, Y
For
, increases purchases of the domestic country’s
goods by foreigners, directly raising the domestic country’s net exports and
shifting the IS curve up.
■ An increase in the foreign real interest rate, r
For
, makes foreign assets relatively
more attractive to domestic and foreign savers, increasing the supply of
domestic currency and causing the exchange rate to depreciate. A lower real
exchange rate stimulates net exports, shifting the domestic country’s IS
curve up.
■ A shift in world demand toward the domestic country’s goods, as might occur if the
quality of domestic goods improved, raises net exports and thus also shifts
the IS curve up. A similar effect would occur if, for example, the domestic
country imposed trade barriers that reduced imports (thereby increasing net
exports); see Analytical Problem 1 at the end of the chapter. Summary table 18
lists factors that shift the open-economy IS curve.

The International Transmission of Business Cycles
In the introduction to this chapter we discussed brieﬂy how trade and ﬁnancial
links among countries transmit cyclical ﬂuctuations across borders. The analysis
here shows that the impact of foreign economic conditions on the real exchange
rate and net exports is one of the principal ways by which cycles are transmitted
internationally.
For example, consider the impact of a recession in the United States on an econ-
omy for which the United States is a major export market—say, Japan. In terms of
the IS–LM model, a decline in U.S. output lowers the demand for Japanese net
exports, which shifts the Japanese IS curve down. In the Keynesian version of the
model, this downward shift of the IS curve throws the Japanese economy into a
recession, with output below its full-employment level, until price adjustment
restores full employment (see, for example, Fig. 11.7). Japanese output also is pre-
dicted to fall in the classical model with misperceptions because the drop in net
exports implies a decline in the Japanese aggregate demand (AD) curve and the
short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve slopes upward. However, in the basic
classical model without misperceptions, output remains at its full-employment level
so the decline in net exports wouldn’t affect Japanese output.
Similarly, a country’s domestic economy can be sensitive to shifts in interna-
tional tastes for various goods. For example, a shift in demand away from Japanese
goods—induced perhaps by trade restrictions against Japanese products—would
shift the Japanese IS curve down, with the same contractionary effects as the
decrease in foreign (U.S.) output had.
13.4 Macroeconomic Policy in an Open Economy
with Flexible Exchange Rates
A primary reason for developing the IS–LM model for the open economy is to deter-
mine how borrowing and trading links among countries affect ﬁscal and monetary
policies. When exchange rates are ﬂexible, the effects of macroeconomic policy on
domestic variables such as output and the real interest rate are largely unchanged when
foreign trade is added. However, adding foreign trade raises two new questions: (1)
How do ﬁscal and monetary policy affect a country’s real exchange rate and net exports?
and (2) How do the macroeconomic policies of one country affect the economies of other
countries? With the open-economy IS–LM model, we can answer both questions.

496 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
To examine the international effects of various domestic macroeconomic poli-
cies, we proceed as follows:
1. We use the IS–LM diagram for the domestic economy to determine the effects
of the policies on domestic output and the domestic real interest rate. This
step is the same as in our analyses of closed economies in Chapters 9–11.
2. We apply the results of Section 13.2 (see in particular Summary table 16, p. 488,
and Summary table 17, p. 489) to determine how changes in domestic output
and the domestic real interest rate affect the exchange rate and net exports.
3. We use the IS–LM diagram for the foreign economy to determine the effects of
the domestic policies on foreign output and the foreign real interest rate.
Domestic policies that change the demand for the foreign country’s net
exports will shift the foreign IS curve.
A Fiscal Expansion
To consider the effects of ﬁscal policy in an open economy, let’s look again at a tem-
porary increase in domestic government purchases. In analyzing this policy change
we use the classical version of the IS–LM model (with no misperceptions) but also
discuss the results that would be obtained in the Keynesian framework.
Figure 13.9 shows two IS–LM diagrams, one for the domestic country (where the
ﬁscal policy change is taking place) and one for the foreign country, representing the
domestic country’s major trading partners. Suppose that the original equilibrium is at
point E in Fig. 13.9(a). As usual, the increase in government purchases shifts the domes-
tic IS curve up and to the right, from IS
1
to IS
2
. In addition, in the classical model the FE
line shifts to the right, from FE
1
to FE
2
. The reason for this shift is that the increase in gov-
ernment purchases raises present or future tax burdens; because higher taxes make
workers poorer, they increase their labor supply , which raises full-employment output.
The new equilibrium is represented by point F, the intersection of IS
2
and FE
2
. The
domestic price level rises, shifting the domestic LM curve up and to the left, from LM
1
to LM
2
, until it passes through F. Comparing point F with point E reveals that the
increase in government purchases increases both output, Y, and the real interest rate, r,
in the domestic country. So far the analysis is identical to the classical analysis for a
closed economy (Chapter 10). Note also that ﬁscal expansion raises output and the real
interest rate—the same results that we would get from the Keynesian model.
To examine the role of international trade, we ﬁrst consider the effects on the
exchange rate of the increases in domestic output and the domestic real interest
rate. Recall that an increase in output, Y, causes domestic residents to demand
more imports and thus to supply more currency to the foreign exchange market.
The increase in domestic output therefore depreciates the exchange rate. However,
the rise in the domestic real interest rate makes domestic assets more attractive,
causing foreign savers to demand the domestic currency and appreciating the
exchange rate. The overall effect of the increase in government purchases on the
exchange rate is ambiguous: We can’t be sure whether the increase in government
purchases will raise or lower the exchange rate.
The effect of the ﬁscal expansion on the country’s net export demand isn’t
ambiguous. Recall that the increase in domestic output (which raises domestic
consumers’ demand for imports) and the increase in the real interest rate (which
tends to appreciate the exchange rate) both cause net exports to fall. Thus the over-
all effect of the ﬁscal expansion clearly is to move the country’s trade balance

Effects of an increase

government purchases
(a) In the classical IS–LM
model, an increase in
domestic government
purchases shifts the
domestic IS curve up and
to the right, from IS
1
to
IS
2
. It also shifts the
domestic FE line to the
right, from FE
1

Therefore domestic
output and the domestic
real interest rate both
increase. These increases
reduce net exports but
have an ambiguous effect
on the real exchange rate.
The results are similar in
the Keynesian model. 
(b) Because the domestic
country’s exports are the
foreign country’s
imports, and vice versa,
the decrease in the
domestic country’s net
exports is equivalent to a
rise in the foreign coun-
try’s net exports. This
increase shifts the foreign
IS curve up, from to
. In the classical
model, prices adjust
rapidly, shifting the LM
curve from to
. The new equilib-
rium is at point F, where
the foreign real interest
rate and price level are
higher but foreign output
is unchanged. In the
Keynesian model, price
stickiness would cause a
temporary increase in
foreign output at H
before price adjustment
restores general equilib-
rium at F.

toward deﬁcit. This result is consistent with the analysis of the “twin deﬁcits” (the
government budget deﬁcit and the trade deﬁcit) in Chapter 5.
In an interconnected world, the effects of macroeconomic policies in one country
aren’t limited to that country but also are felt abroad. Based on the analysis we’ve just
ﬁnished, taking the extra step and ﬁnding out how the domestic ﬁscal expansion
affects the economies of the domestic country’s trading partners isn’t difﬁcult.
The effects of the domestic fiscal expansion on the rest of the world—
represented by the foreign country IS–LM diagram in Fig. 13.9(b)—are transmitted
through the change in net exports. Because the domestic country’s imports are the
foreign country’s exports, and vice versa, the decline in net exports of the domes-
tic country is equivalent to an increase in net exports for the foreign country. Thus
the foreign country’s IS curve shifts up, from to .
In the classical IS–LM model, the upward shift of the foreign IS curve doesn’t
affect foreign output; instead the price level rises immediately to restore general equi-
librium (the LM curve shifts up from to ). The foreign economy ends up
at point F, with the real interest rate and the price level higher than they were initially.
If prices were sticky , as in the Keynesian model, the effects of the shift of the for-
eign country’s IS curve would be slightly different. If prices don’t adjust in the
short run, the shift of the IS curve implies that the foreign economy would have tem-
porarily higher output at the intersection of the IS and LM curves at point H in 
Fig. 13.9(b); only after ﬁrms adjust their prices would the economy arrive at point F.
Otherwise, the implications of the classical and Keynesian analyses are the same.
11
Therefore, in the open-economy versions of both the classical and Keynesian
models, a temporary increase in government purchases raises domestic income and
the domestic real interest rate, as in a closed economy. In addition, net exports fall;
thus increased government purchases reduce, or crowd out, both investment and
net exports. The effect on the real exchange rate is ambiguous: It can either rise or
fall. In the foreign economy the real interest rate and the price level rise. In the Key-
nesian version of the model, foreign output also rises, but only in the short run.
A Monetary Contraction
We can also use the open-economy IS–LM model to study the effects of monetary
policy when exchange rates are ﬂexible. For the Keynesian version of the IS–LM
model we analyze the effects of a drop in the money supply in both the short and
long run. Because the effects of monetary policy are the same in the basic classical
model (without misperceptions) and the long-run Keynesian model, our analysis
applies to the classical model as well.
Short-Run Effects on the Domestic and Foreign Economies. The effects of a
monetary contraction are shown in Fig. 13.10, which shows IS–LM diagrams
corresponding to both the domestic and foreign countries. Suppose that the initial
equilibrium is represented by point E and that a decrease in the money supply
shifts the domestic LM curve up and to the left, from LM
1
to LM
2
, in 
Fig. 13.10(a). In the Keynesian model, the price level is rigid in the short run, so the
short-run equilibrium is at point F, the intersection of the IS and LM
2
curves.

In principle, we could continue the analysis by discussing how changes in foreign output and real
interest rates in turn affect the domestic economy. However, these so-called feedback effects are
generally small and thus don’t reverse any of our conclusions, so we omit this discussion.

Comparing points F and E reveals that in the short run domestic output falls and the
domestic real interest rate rises. This result is the same as for the closed economy.
After the monetary contraction, the exchange rate appreciates in the short run,
for two reasons. First, the drop in domestic income reduces the domestic demand
for imports, leading domestic consumers to demand less foreign currency to buy
imported goods. Second, the rise in the domestic real interest rate makes domestic
assets relatively more attractive to foreign and domestic savers, increasing foreign
savers’ demand for the domestic currency and reducing domestic savers’ supply of
domestic currency to the foreign exchange market.
What happens to the country’s net exports? Here there are two competing
effects: (1) The drop in domestic income created by the monetary contraction
reduces the domestic demand for foreign goods and thus tends to increase the
country’s net exports; but (2) the rise in the real interest rate, which leads to
exchange rate appreciation, tends to reduce net exports. The theory doesn’t indicate
for certain which way net exports will change. In our earlier discussion of the 
J curve, however, we noted that the effects of changes in the real exchange rate on
net exports may be weak in the short run. Based on that analysis, we assume that
in the short run exchange rate effects on net exports are weaker than the effects of changes
in domestic income so that overall the country’s net exports will increase.
The next question is: How does the domestic monetary contraction affect the
economies of the country’s trading partners? The effects on the typical foreign
economy are illustrated by Fig. 13.10(b). If the domestic country’s net exports are
increased by the monetary contraction, the foreign country’s net exports must
decrease because the domestic country’s exports are the foreign country’s
imports. Thus the IS curve of the foreign country shifts down and to the left, from
to . The short-run equilibrium is at point F, where the and LM
For
curves intersect. Output in the foreign country declines, and the foreign real
interest rate falls.
These results show that a domestic monetary contraction also leads to a reces-
sion abroad. This transmission of recession occurs because the decline in domes-
tic output also reduces domestic demand for foreign goods. The appreciation of
the domestic real exchange rate works in the opposite direction by making foreign
goods relatively cheaper, which tends to increase the net exports of the foreign
country. However, we have assumed that the negative effect of declining domes-
tic income on the foreign country’s net exports is stronger than the positive effect
of the appreciating domestic exchange rate. Thus a domestic monetary contraction
leads to a recession in both the foreign country and the domestic country.
Long-Run Effects on the Domestic and Foreign Economies. In the long run
after a monetary contraction, wages and prices decline in the domestic country, as
ﬁrms ﬁnd themselves selling less output than they desire. The domestic country’s
LM curve returns to its initial position, LM
1
in Fig. 13.10(a), so that money is
neutral in the long run. As all real variables in the domestic economy return to
their original levels, the real exchange rate and the domestic demand for foreign
goods also return to their original levels. As a result, the foreign country’s 
IS curve shifts back to its initial position, in Fig. 13.10(b), and the foreign
country’s economy also returns to its initial equilibrium point, E. At E, all foreign
macroeconomic variables (including the price level) are at their original levels.
Hence in the long run the change in the domestic money supply doesn’t affect any
real variables, either domestically or abroad. In particular, the real exchange rate
and net exports aren’t affected by the monetary contraction in the long run.

Chapter 13 Exchange Rates, Business Cycles, and Macroeconomic Policy in the Open Economy 501
Although monetary neutrality holds in the long run in the Keynesian model, it
holds immediately in the basic classical model. So, in the basic classical model,
monetary policy changes have no effect on real exchange rates or trade ﬂows; they
affect only the price level. In a monetary contraction, the domestic price level will
fall (the foreign price level doesn’t change).
Although money can’t affect the real exchange rate in the long run, it does affect
the nominal exchange rate by changing the domestic price level. (This is one case
where the responses of the real and nominal exchange rates to a change in macro-
economic conditions differ.) As we have shown, the long-run neutrality of money
implies that a 10% decrease in the nominal money supply will decrease the domes-
tic price level by 10%. Note that Eq. (13.1) implies that the nominal exchange rate,
e
nom
, equals eP
For
/ P, where e is the real exchange rate, P
For
is the foreign price level,
and P is the domestic price level. Because the real exchange rate, e, and the foreign
price level, P
For
, are unchanged in the long run by a domestic monetary contraction,
the 10% drop in the domestic price level, P, raises the nominal exchange rate, e
nom
, by
(approximately) 10%. Thus a monetary contraction reduces the domestic price level
and appreciates the nominal exchange rate by the same percentage as the drop in
money supply.
13.5 Fixed Exchange Rates
The United States has had a ﬂexible exchange rate since abandonment of the Bretton
Woods system of ﬁxed exchange rates during the early 1970s. However, ﬁxed-
exchange-rate systems—in which exchange rates are ofﬁcially set by international
agreement—have been important historically and are still used by many countries.
Let’s now consider ﬁxed-exchange-rate systems and address two questions: (1) How
does the use of a ﬁxed-exchange-rate system affect an economy and macroeconomic
policy? and (2) Ultimately , which is the better system, ﬂexible or ﬁxed exchange rates?
Fixing the Exchange Rate
In contrast to ﬂexible-exchange-rate systems—where exchange rates are deter-
mined by supply and demand in foreign exchange markets—in a ﬁxed-exchange-
rate system the value of the nominal exchange rate is officially set by the
government, perhaps in consultation or agreement with other countries.
12
A potential problem with ﬁxed-exchange-rate systems is that the value of the
exchange rate set by the government may not be the exchange rate determined by the
supply and demand for currency. Figure 13.11 shows a situation in which the ofﬁcial
exchange rate, 
nom
, is higher than the fundamental value of the exchange rate, ,
or the value that would be determined by free market forces without government
intervention. When an exchange rate is higher than its fundamental value, it is an
overvalued exchange rate (often referred to as an overvalued currency).
How can a country deal with a situation in which its ofﬁcial exchange rate is
different from the fundamental value of its exchange rate? There are several possi-
ble strategies: First, the country can simply change the ofﬁcial value of its exchange
rate so that it equals, or is close to, its fundamental value. For example, in the case
of overvaluation shown in Fig. 13.11, the country could simply devalue (lower) its
e
nom

e
12
In some ﬁxed-exchange-rate systems, the exchange rate is allowed to ﬂuctuate within a narrow, prespeci-
ﬁed band. For simplicity, we will assume in this section that the exchange rate is ﬁxed at a single value.

higher than the funda-

determined by supply
and demand in the for-
eign exchange market. In
this situation the
exchange rate is said to
be overvalued. The coun-
try’s central bank can
maintain the exchange
rate at the ofﬁcial rate by
using its reserves to pur-
chase its own currency in
the foreign exchange
market, in the amount of
AB in each period. This
loss of reserves also is
referred to as the coun-
try’s balance of pay-
ments deﬁcit.

devaluations or revaluations can be expected under ﬁxed-exchange-rate systems,
if a country continuously adjusts its exchange rate it might as well switch to a
ﬂexible-rate system.
Second, the government could restrict international transactions—for example,
by limiting or taxing imports or ﬁnancial outﬂows. Such policies reduce the supply
of the domestic currency to the foreign exchange market, thus raising the funda-
mental value of the exchange rate toward its ﬁxed value. Some countries go even
further and prohibit people from trading the domestic currency for foreign cur-
rencies without government approval; a currency that can’t be freely traded for
other currencies is said to be an inconvertible currency. However, direct govern-
ment intervention in international transactions has many economic costs, including
reduced access to foreign goods and credit.
Third, the government itself may become a demander or supplier of its currency
in the foreign exchange market, an approach used by most of the industrialized coun-
tries having ﬁxed exchange rates. For example, in the case of overvaluation shown in
Fig. 13.11, the supply of the country’s currency to the foreign exchange market
(point B) exceeds private demand for the currency (point A) at the ofﬁcial exchange
rate by the amount AB. To maintain the value of the currency at the ofﬁcial rate, the
government could buy back its own currency in the amount AB in each period.
Usually, these currency purchases are made by the nation’s central bank, using
ofﬁcial reserve assets. Recall (Chapter 5) that ofﬁcial reserve assets are assets other than
domestic money or securities that can be used to make international payments (exam-
ples are gold, foreign bank deposits, or special assets created by international agencies
such as the International Monetary Fund). During the gold standard period, for exam-
ple, gold was the basic form of ofﬁcial reserve asset, and central banks offered to

Chapter 13 Exchange Rates, Business Cycles, and Macroeconomic Policy in the Open Economy 503
exchange gold for their own currencies at a ﬁxed price. If Fig. 13.11 represented a gold-
standard country, AB would represent the amount of gold the central bank would
have to use to buy back its currency in each period to equalize the quantities of its cur-
rency supplied and demanded at the ofﬁcial exchange rate. Recall also that the decline
in a country’s ofﬁcial reserve assets during a year equals its balance of payments deﬁcit.
Thus amount AB measures the reserves the central bank must use to support the cur-
rency and corresponds to the country’s balance of payments deﬁcit.
Although a central bank can maintain an overvalued exchange rate for a time
by offering to buy back its own currency at a ﬁxed price, it can’t do so forever
because it has only a limited supply of ofﬁcial reserve assets. During the gold stan-
dard period, for example, central banks did not own unlimited amounts of gold.
Attempting to support an overvalued currency for a long period of time would
have exhausted a central bank’s limited gold reserves, leaving the country no
choice but to devalue its currency.
A central bank’s attempts to support an overvalued currency can be ended quick-
ly and dramatically by a speculative run. A speculative run, also called a speculative
attack, occurs when ﬁnancial investors begin to fear that an overvalued currency may
soon be devalued, reducing the value of assets denominated in that currency relative
to assets denominated in other currencies. To avoid losses, ﬁnancial investors franti-
cally sell assets denominated in the overvalued currency . The panicky sales of domes-
tic assets associated with a speculative run on a currency shift the supply curve for
that currency sharply to the right (see Fig. 13.12), increasing the gap between the
quantities supplied and demanded of the currency from amount AB to amount AC.
This widening gap increases the rate at which the central bank has to spend its ofﬁcial
reserve assets to maintain the overvalued exchange rate, speeding devaluation and
conﬁrming the ﬁnancial investors’ expectations. For example, in 2002, Argentina faced
just such a crisis, as we discuss in the Application “Crisis in Argentina,” p. 511.
Figure 13.12

Initially, the supply
curve of the domestic
currency is S

and, to
maintain the ﬁxed
exchange rate, the central
bank must use amount
AB of its reserves each
period to purchase its
own currency in the for-
eign exchange market. A
speculative run occurs
when holders of domes-
tic assets begin to fear a
devaluation, which
would reduce the values
of their assets (measured
in terms of foreign cur-
rency). Panicky sales of
domestic-currency assets
lead to more domestic
currency being supplied
to the foreign exchange
market, which shifts the
supply curve of the
domestic currency to the
right, from S

to S

central bank must now
purchase its currency
and lose reserves in the
amount AC. This more
rapid loss of reserves
may force the central
bank to stop supporting
the overvalued currency
and to devalue it, con-
ﬁrming the market’s
expectations.

Without strong restrictions on international trade and ﬁnance (themselves eco-
nomically costly), we conclude that an overvalued exchange rate isn’t sustainable
for long. If the exchange rate is overvalued, the country must either devalue its cur-
rency or make some policy change to raise the fundamental value of the exchange
rate. We show in the next section that the basic tool for changing the fundamental
value of the exchange rate is monetary policy.
We’ve focused on overvaluation, but an exchange rate also could be underval-
ued. As illustrated in Fig. 13.13, an undervalued exchange rate (or undervalued
currency) exists if the ofﬁcially ﬁxed value is less than the value determined by
supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. In this case, instead of buying
its own currency, the central bank sells its currency to the foreign exchange market
and accumulates reserves in the amount AB each period. With no limit to the quan-
tity of reserve assets (gold, for example) a central bank could accumulate, an under-
valued exchange rate could apparently be maintained indeﬁnitely. However, a
country with an undervalued exchange rate can accumulate reserves only at the
expense of trading partners who have overvalued exchange rates and are therefore
losing reserves. Because the country’s trading partners can’t continue to lose
reserves indeﬁnitely, eventually they may put political pressure on the country to
bring the fundamental value of its exchange rate back in line with the ofﬁcial rate.
Monetary Policy and the Fixed Exchange Rate
Suppose that a country wants to eliminate currency overvaluation by raising the
fundamental value of its nominal exchange rate until it equals the ﬁxed value of the
exchange rate. How can it achieve this goal? Economists have long recognized
that the best way for a country to do so is through contraction of its money supply.

Chapter 13 Exchange Rates, Business Cycles, and Macroeconomic Policy in the Open Economy 505
To demonstrate why a monetary contraction raises the fundamental value of
the nominal exchange rate, we ﬁrst rewrite Eq. (13.1), which deﬁned the relation-
ship of the real and nominal exchange rates:
(13.6)
Equation (13.6) states that, for any foreign price level, P
For
, the nominal exchange
rate, e
nom
, is proportional to the real exchange rate, e, and inversely proportional to
the domestic price level, P.
In our earlier discussion of monetary policy in the Keynesian model with ﬂex-
ible exchange rates, we showed that a monetary contraction causes the real
exchange rate to appreciate in the short run by reducing domestic output and
increasing the real interest rate. Because short-run domestic and foreign price levels
are ﬁxed in the Keynesian model, Eq. (13.6) indicates that the short-run apprecia-
tion of the real exchange rate also implies a short-run appreciation of the nominal
exchange rate. In the long run money is neutral; hence a monetary contraction has
no effect on the real exchange rate, but it does cause the domestic price level to fall.
In the long run the domestic price level, P, falls but the real exchange rate, e, is unaf-
fected, so Eq. (13.6) implies that the nominal exchange rate rises (appreciates) both
in the long run and the short run. Thus in both the short and long run a monetary
contraction increases the fundamental value of the nominal exchange rate, or the
value of the nominal exchange rate determined by supply and demand in the for-
eign exchange market.
13
Conversely, a monetary easing reduces the fundamental
value of the nominal exchange rate in both the short and long run.
Figure 13.14 illustrates the relationship between the nominal exchange rate
and the money supply in a country with a ﬁxed exchange rate.
14
The downward-
sloping curve shows the relationship of the money supply to the fundamental
value of the nominal exchange rate. This curve slopes downward because, other
factors being equal, an increase in the money supply reduces the fundamental
value of the nominal exchange rate. The horizontal line in Fig. 13.14 is the ofﬁcially
determined exchange rate. The value of M
1
on the horizontal axis is the money
supply that equalizes the fundamental value of the exchange rate and its ofﬁcial-
ly ﬁxed value. If the money supply is more than M
1
, the country has an overval-
uation problem (the fundamental value of the exchange rate is below the ofﬁcial
value), and if the money supply is less than M
1
, the country has an undervaluation
problem.
Figure 13.14 suggests that, in a ﬁxed-exchange-rate system, individual coun-
tries typically are not free to expand their money supplies to try to raise output and
employment. Instead, the money supply is governed by the condition that the ofﬁ-
cial and fundamental values of the exchange rate be the same. If the country rep-
resented in Fig. 13.14 wanted to expand its money supply to ﬁght a recession, for
example, it could do so only by creating an overvaluation problem (most likely
leading to a future devaluation) or by devaluing its currency immediately. Under

Because money is always neutral in the basic classical model, a monetary contraction increases the
fundamental value of the nominal exchange rate in the basic classical model as well.
14
The country’s money supply is the amount of money in circulation domestically, as in previous
chapters. It is not the supply of currency to foreign exchange markets, which depends only on domes-
tic residents’ demands for foreign goods and assets.

ﬁxed exchange rates, then, a central bank cannot use monetary policy to pursue
macroeconomic stabilization goals.
Although one member of a group of countries in a ﬁxed-exchange-rate system
generally isn’t free to use monetary policy by itself, the group as a whole may be able
to do so, if the members coordinate their policies. For example, suppose that
Argentina and Brazil have a ﬁxed exchange rate between their two currencies and
that, because of a recession in both countries, both want to expand their money
supplies. If Brazil attempts a monetary expansion on its own, from M
1
to M
2
in 
Fig. 13.15, its exchange rate will become overvalued (its fundamental value, at the
intersection of M
2
and FV
1
, would be lower than the ofﬁcial exchange rate). As a
result, the central bank of Brazil would lose reserves, ultimately forcing Brazil to
undo its attempted expansion.
Suppose, however, that Argentina goes ahead with its own money supply
expansion. If Brazil’s money supply remains constant, an increase in Argentina’s
money supply reduces the fundamental value of Argentina’s (nominal) exchange
rate, which is equivalent to raising the fundamental value of Brazil’s exchange
rate at any level of its money supply, as shown in Fig. 13.15. The fundamental
value curve in Fig. 13.15 shifts up, from FV
1
to FV
2
. Now Brazil can expand its
money supply, from M

to M
2
, without creating an overvaluation problem (the fun-
damental value of the Brazilian exchange rate at the intersection of M
2
and FV
2
is
the same as the ofﬁcial exchange rate). Thus, if Argentina and Brazil cooperate by
changing their money supplies in the same proportion, both countries can achieve
their stabilization goals without either country experiencing overvaluation. This
example shows that ﬁxed exchange rates are most likely to work well when the
countries in the system have similar macroeconomic goals, face similar shocks,
and can cooperate on monetary policies.

Fixed Versus Flexible Exchange Rates
We have discussed the overvaluation and undervaluation problems that can arise
in fixed-exchange-rate systems. However, flexible-exchange-rate systems have
problems of their own, primarily the volatility of exchange rates, which introduces
uncertainty for people and businesses in their transactions with other countries.
Each type of system has its problems, so which is preferable?
Proponents of ﬁxed-exchange-rate systems stress two major beneﬁts. First, rel-
ative to a situation in which exchange rates ﬂuctuate continuously, ﬁxed exchange
rates (if they are stable and not subject to frequent changes or speculative crises)
may make trading goods and assets among countries easier and less costly. Thus a
system of ﬁxed rates may promote economic and ﬁnancial integration and improve
economic efﬁciency. Second, ﬁxed exchange rates may improve monetary policy
“discipline,” in the sense that countries with ﬁxed exchange rates typically are less
able to carry out highly expansionary monetary policies; the result may be lower
inﬂation in the long run.
The other side of the monetary discipline argument is that ﬁxed exchange rates
take away a country’s ability to use monetary policy ﬂexibly to deal with reces-
sions.
15
This inability is particularly serious if the different countries in the ﬁxed-
exchange-rate system have different policy goals and face different types of economic
shocks. Thus, for instance, one country may want to expand its money supply to ﬁght
a recession while another country does not want to increase its money supply. This
divergence in monetary policies between the two countries would put downward
pressure on the exchange rate of the country that increases its money supply, and
thus would strain the ﬁxed exchange rate between the two countries.
15
Keynesians consider this inﬂexibility to be a cost, but classicals don’t.
M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:49 AM  Page 507
508 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
Which system is better depends on the circumstances. Fixed exchange rates
among a group of countries are useful when large beneﬁts can be gained from
increased trade and integration and when the countries in the system coordinate
their monetary policies closely. Countries that value the ability to use monetary
policy independently—perhaps because they face different macroeconomic shocks
than other countries or hold different views about the relative costs of unemploy-
ment and inﬂation—should retain a ﬂoating exchange rate.
Currency Unions
An alternative to fixing exchange rates is for a group of countries to form a
currency union, under which they agree to share a common currency. Members of
a currency union also typically cooperate economically and politically. The agree-
ment among the original thirteen colonies, enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, to
abandon their individual currencies and create a single currency, is an early exam-
ple of a currency union. The Application “European Monetary Unification” 
discusses a contemporary currency union.
An effective currency union usually requires more than just cooperation of
national central banks. For a currency union to work, the common monetary policy
must be controlled by a single institution. Because countries are typically reluctant
to give up their own currencies and monetary policies, currency unions have been
rare. However, if politically feasible, a currency union has at least two advantages
over ﬁxed exchange rates. First, the costs of trading goods and assets among coun-
tries are even lower with a single currency than under ﬁxed exchange rates. Second,
if national currencies are eliminated in favor of the common currency, speculative
attacks on the national currencies obviously can no longer occur.
However, a currency union shares the major disadvantage of a ﬁxed-exchange-rate
system: It requires all of its members to pursue a common monetary policy . Thus, if one
member of a currency union is in a recession while another is concerned about inﬂa-
tion, the common monetary policy can’t deal with both countries’ problems simulta-
neously. In contrast, under ﬂexible exchange rates, each country could set its own
monetary policy independently.
APPLICATION
European Monetary Unification
In December 1991 at a summit meeting in Maastricht in the Netherlands, the
member countries of the European Community (EC) adopted the Treaty on
European Union, usually called the Maastricht Treaty. This treaty took effect in
November 1993, after being ratiﬁed (with some resistance) by popular votes in the
member countries. One of the most important provisions of the treaty was that
those member countries meeting certain criteria (including the achievement of
low inflation rates and small government budget deficits) would adopt a 
common currency, to be called the euro. The common currency came into being on
January 1, 1999. Eleven countries, with a collective population and GDP similar to
those of the United States, joined the new currency union.
16
16
Five additional countries have subsequently joined the union, so now 16 countries have adopted the euro.
M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:49 AM  Page 508
Chapter 13 Exchange Rates, Business Cycles, and Macroeconomic Policy in the Open Economy 509
The common monetary policy for the euro countries is determined by the Governing
Council of the European Central Bank (ECB), a multinational institution located in Frank-
furt, Germany. The Council includes six members of an Executive Board, appointed
through a collective decision of the member countries, plus the governors of the nation-
al central banks of the member countries. Except through their representation on the
Council, the national central banks, such as Germany’s Bundesbank and the Bank of
France, gave up their power to make monetary policy for their countries.
The monetary uniﬁcation of Europe is an important development but one
whose long-term implications remain unknown as yet. Possible advantages of the
currency union include easier movement of goods, capital, and labor among Euro-
pean countries; lower costs of ﬁnancial transactions; and enhanced political and
economic cooperation. An integrated European market would rival that of the
United States in size and wealth, and the euro could become a preferred currency
for international transactions, as the dollar is today. A major risk to monetary uni-
ﬁcation is that member countries might disagree about whether the common mon-
etary policy should be expansionary or contractionary at any particular time.
Indeed, at the time of the introduction of the euro, a recession in Europe affected
different member countries to varying degrees. The ECB thus faced the decision of
whether to ease the common monetary policy, to assist those countries worst hit by
the recession, or to leave monetary policy unchanged, as desired by those countries
doing relatively better. The ECB compromised, easing moderately in 1999.
17
The euro made its debut in two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, lasting three years, it was
agreed that the euro would be a “virtual currency”; that is, there would be no actual
euro notes or coins in circulation. Instead, people would continue to use the tradition-
al currencies of Europe (such as German marks and French francs) in hand-to-hand cir-
culation. In the second phase, beginning on January 1, 2002, euro notes and coins were
introduced into circulation and the various national currencies were phased out.
During the ﬁrst, “virtual currency” phase, the value of a euro could be deﬁned
only in relation to the values of existing national currencies. Speciﬁcally, the eleven
nations agreed to give meaning to the idea of a euro by establishing a permanent
rate of exchange between the euro and each existing European currency. Some of
the ofﬁcial rates of exchange are given below:
1 euro = 40.3399 Belgian francs
= 6.5596 French francs
= 1.95583 German marks
= 1936.27 Italian lire
= 166.386 Spanish pesetas
A key advantage of ﬁxing the values of national currencies in terms of euros was
that prices could be quoted anywhere in the participating countries in terms of
euros as well as the local currency, facilitating trade and economic integration.
(Here is a rare situation in which the “medium of exchange” function of money
might be served by one currency—the franc or the mark—and the “unit of account”
function served by another, the euro. See Chapter 7, p. 239.)

510 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
Other advantages of the new system related to exchange rates. First, as of
January 1, 1999, the exchange rates between any two currencies in the European
monetary union were effectively ﬁxed; for example, because 6.5596 French francs
and 1.95583 German marks both equaled one euro, then it also was the case that
6.5596/1.95583 French francs, or 3.354 francs, equaled one mark. Second, after the
introduction of the euro, it was no longer necessary for each European currency to
have a separate exchange rate with currencies outside the European monetary
area, such as the U.S. dollar. Instead, knowing the exchange rate between the euro
and the dollar was sufﬁcient to know the exchange rate between each national cur-
rency and the dollar. For example, suppose that a dollar exchanged for 0.90 euros.
The number of French francs that traded for one dollar could be calculated as
follows:
French francs per dollar = French francs per euro : euros per dollar
= 6.5596 : 0.90
= 5.9036.
When the euro was ofﬁcially introduced in 1999, the market-determined value
of the euro was 1 euro = $1.16 (equivalently, 0.86 euros per dollar). However, to the
surprise of many Europeans, the value of the euro in foreign exchange markets
began to fall steadily . By the time that euro coins and notes were introduced into cir-
culation on January 1, 2002, the value of the euro had dropped to 1 euro = $0.89
(equivalently, 1.12 euros per dollar), that is, the euro had depreciated by nearly
one-fourth relative to the dollar in only three years. The sharp fall in the euro made
imports more expensive for Europeans (while making European vacations a great
deal for U.S. tourists!); it also proved a political embarrassment to the new European
Central Bank, which had promised that the euro would be a “strong” currency.
Several explanations have been proposed for the euro’s unexpected decline.
One of these centers on the attractiveness of U.S. assets to European ﬁnancial
investors. At the time that the euro was introduced, the U.S. economy and stock
market were booming, particularly in the high-tech sector. According to this expla-
nation, Europeans were eager to invest in what they perceived to be high-yielding
U.S. assets. In order to buy U.S. assets, European ﬁnancial investors sold euros and
bought dollars, driving down the value of the euro relative to the dollar. This
explanation is consistent with the large ﬁnancial inﬂows experienced by the United
States during this period, as well as with the strength of the dollar relative to vir-
tually all currencies (not just the euro). However, if the booming U.S. economy and
stock market were the whole story, the euro should have strengthened somewhat
when the U.S. economy weakened and stock prices declined during the year 2000,
but it did not.
An alternative explanation for the sinking euro was offered by German econo-
mists Hans-Werner Sinn and Frank Westermann.
18
Sinn and Westermann pointed
out that much of the demand for stable currencies, such as the U.S. dollar and the
German mark, comes from outside the countries that issue those currencies. In par-
ticular, dollars and marks—often stuffed in suitcases or in mattresses—have long
been attractive stores of value in countries experiencing high inﬂation or political

instability (see “In Touch with Data and Research: Where Have All the Dollars
Gone?”, pp. 242–243). While dollars have been particularly popular in Russia and
Latin America, marks had been the currency of choice in many eastern European
nations, especially after the fall of communism, owing to their proximity to Germany .
According to Sinn and Westermann, the introduction of the euro in January
1999 posed a problem for foreign holders of marks. Hearing that the mark was to
be abolished in favor of the euro, many holders of black market marks outside of
Germany began to worry that their cash hoards might become worthless. More
sophisticated holders of marks understood that their cash would be convertible
into euros, but were concerned that the conversion process would be difﬁcult or
might force them to reveal their mark holdings to the authorities. If it had been pos-
sible, many mark-holders might have traded their marks for euros on the black
market; however, euros did not yet exist in physical form, making such transactions
impossible. By Sinn and Westermann’s account, mark-holders chose instead to sell
their marks and obtain dollars, raising the value of the dollar and reducing the
value of the mark. Because the mark was ofﬁcially tied to the euro, the falling
mark implied a falling euro as well. Consistent with this story is a substantial
increase in dollars in circulation during this period and a corresponding decline in
outstanding marks.
With the introduction of euro currency and coin into circulation in January
2002, it became possible to hold hoards of cash in euros as easily as in dollars.
Indeed, because euro notes come in relatively large denominations, euros may be
more attractive than dollars for hoarding purposes. The rise in the value of the euro
following January 2002 is consistent with the Sinn-Westermann interpretation.
APPLICATION
Crisis in Argentina
In 2002, Argentina’s economy began to rebound after several years of a deep reces-
sion, high unemployment, and a crushing international debt that led Argentines to
take to the streets in large numbers to protest against the government. How did this
all come about?
The Argentine story has been one of intermittent economic progress interrupt-
ed by periodic crises. During the 1970s and 1980s, Argentina’s main economic
problem was persistent, extreme inﬂation. By the fourth quarter of 1990, the CPI in
Argentina was more than 10 billion times its level at the beginning of 1975! During
the 1980s, Argentina twice changed its currency in unsuccessful attempts to halt its
spectacularly high inﬂation. Shortly after Raul Alfonsin was elected president in
December 1983, Argentina created a new “peso Argentino” equal to 10,000 old
pesos. Less than two years later, in June 1985, Argentina introduced yet another
new currency, the austral, declaring each austral the equivalent of 1,000 peso
Argentinos. The currency changes were accompanied by other economic policy
changes, but neither attempt at stopping inﬂation proved successful.

M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:49 AM  Page 511
512 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
A third attempt at curbing inﬂation, in April 1991, worked much better; indeed,
following the 1991 policy changes, Argentina had virtually no inﬂation for more
than a decade. One element of the 1991 anti-inﬂation policy was the creation of yet
another new currency, called the new peso, worth 10,000 australs. Much more
important than the new currency, however, was a comprehensive reform package,
designed by Economics Minister Domingo Cavallo and supported by Argentine
President Carlos Menem. Cavallo’s package reduced the size of the government’s
budget deﬁcit and introduced measures to make the Argentine economy more
competitive internationally. The budget deﬁcit was reduced by cutting back on
public spending, reforming the tax system, and cracking down on tax evasion. To
open up the Argentine economy to foreign competition, the government reduced
tariffs and removed various restrictions on imports.
However, the linchpin of the successful 1991 reform was the so-called con-
vertibility law, which established a currency board in Argentina. A currency board
is a monetary arrangement under which the supply of domestic currency in circu-
lation is strictly limited by the amount of foreign reserves held by the central bank.
The purpose of a currency board is to impose discipline on the central bank. By lim-
iting the central bank’s power to create money, the currency board helps to reassure
the public that the money supply will not be recklessly increased. A stable money
supply, in turn, should ensure that domestic inﬂation will be held in check, and that
the nominal exchange rate can be maintained at a constant value.
Speciﬁcally, the 1991 convertibility law ﬁxed the exchange rate for Argentina’s
new peso at one U.S. dollar per peso, and limited the total number of pesos in cir-
culation to no more than the number of U.S. dollars held by the Argentine central
bank. (In practice, some loopholes in the law allowed dollar holdings to be a bit
lower than pesos in circulation.) Because Argentine pesos were supposed to be
fully backed, one-for-one, by U.S. dollars, the currency board gave holders of pesos
conﬁdence that their pesos could be easily and quickly converted into dollars—and
hence that “a peso is as good as a dollar.”
The establishment of the currency board and the other reforms implemented
by Cavallo in 1991 seemed to be successful. The currency board achieved its goal of
price stability. During the second half of the 1990s, the Argentine inﬂation rate
was essentially zero—indeed, the CPI in the fourth quarter of 1999 was slightly
lower than in the fourth quarter of 1995. The real economy also performed well for
much of the 1990s: Real GDP grew at an average rate of 5.8% per year from 1990 to
1998, an impressive rate that appears even more impressive when compared with
the -0.2% per year average growth rate in Argentina from 1975 to 1990. By the mid-
1990s, the 1991 reform package was widely viewed as a resounding success.
In the latter part of the 1990s, however, Argentina slipped into recession, with
real GDP falling by 3.4% in 1999 and the unemployment rate rising well into
double digits. Moreover, other economic clouds loomed on the horizon. Govern-
ment budget deﬁcits, a traditional problem in Argentina, began to grow again,
reﬂecting attempts to stimulate the economy through increased spending, higher
wages for government workers, and the large costs incurred in a major reform of
the social security system. With a rapidly increasing need to borrow, the govern-
ment found the public unwilling to buy government debt, and so it raised funds by
coercing private commercial banks into making loans to the government. Deposi-
tors, alarmed that the forced loans might threaten the ﬁnancial health of the banks,
M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:49 AM  Page 512
Chapter 13 Exchange Rates, Business Cycles, and Macroeconomic Policy in the Open Economy 513
began to withdraw their funds. To slow the outﬂow of deposits from banks, on
December 1, 2001, the government imposed a corralito (little fence) that limited
withdrawals by depositors to $1000 per month. Although the measure reduced the
outﬂow of deposits, it also severely disrupted commerce.
In addition to its domestic ﬁscal problems, Argentina suffered from an increas-
ingly overvalued real exchange rate, particularly in comparison with trading part-
ners such as Brazil. In January 1999, the Brazilian real depreciated by almost 40%
relative to the U.S. dollar and the Argentine peso. This 40% increase in the value
of the peso relative to the real further exacerbated Argentina’s current account
problems.
Throughout most of the 1990s, Argentina ran large current account deﬁcits,
leading its foreign debt to grow to about one-half of a year’s GDP . One response to
an overvalued ﬁxed exchange rate is to devalue, bringing its ofﬁcial value closer to
its fundamental value. In Argentina’s case, a lower exchange rate might have
helped to reduce its current account deﬁcit, by stimulating exports and restraining
imports. However, the currency board arrangement in Argentina, which main-
tained Argentina’s exchange rate ﬁxed in terms of the dollar, did not permit an easy
devaluation. Argentina was reluctant to devalue the peso because it did not want
to undermine the currency board that was widely viewed as the source of price
stability.
But the deepening recession, the heavy interest payments on foreign debt, and
the riots in the streets took their toll. Argentina announced that it would cease pay-
ment on its $155 billion of foreign debt, the largest such default in history. Then, in
January 2002, Argentina abandoned the currency board and let the nominal value
of the peso ﬂoat relative to the dollar. On January 10, 2002, the peso lost 29% of its
value, falling from one dollar per peso to only 0.71 dollars per peso. By February 1,
the peso had lost fully half of its value, selling at a price of 0.49 dollars. The halv-
ing of the value of peso doubled the number of pesos needed to pay any dollar
amount of debt owed to foreigners. This sudden doubling in the peso value of
dollar-denominated foreign debt forced many borrowers to default on loans. But
later in 2002, the economy began to grow again, and by July 2003, although the
peso was worth just 0.36 dollars, both GDP and industrial production were grow-
ing at a solid pace, a sign that the Argentine economy might have turned the
corner. However, the inﬂation rate returned to double digits (and averaged 11%
from 2002 to 2008), so ultimately the currency board’s goal was defeated.
CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. The nominal exchange rate is the number of units of
foreign currency that can be obtained for one unit of
domestic currency. The real exchange rate is the
number of units of foreign goods that can be obtained
for one unit of the domestic good. The idea that simi-
lar foreign and domestic goods should have the same
prices in terms of the same currency is called pur-
chasing power parity (PPP).
2. There are two major types of exchange rate systems:
ﬂexible- or ﬂoating-exchange-rate systems, in which
the value of the nominal exchange rate is determined
by market forces; and ﬁxed-exchange-rate systems, in
which the value of the exchange rate is ofﬁcially set
by a government or group of governments. In a ﬂex-
ible-exchange-rate system, an exchange rate increase
is called an appreciation, and an exchange rate
decrease is called a depreciation.
3. The real exchange rate is important because it affects
net exports, or exports minus imports. Other factors
held constant, a decline in the real exchange rate
M13_ABEL4529_07_SE_C13.QXD  12/18/09  4:49 AM  Page 513
514 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
makes domestic goods cheaper relative to foreign
goods and thus tends to increase net exports in the
long run. Because a drop in the real exchange rate
raises the cost of imports, however, it may cause net
exports to fall in the short run before physical ﬂows
of exports and imports have had time to adjust. The
characteristic pattern of the response of net exports to
a drop in the real exchange rate—falling net exports
in the short run but rising net exports in the long
run—is called the J curve.
4. In a ﬂexible-exchange-rate system, the value of the
(nominal) exchange rate is determined by supply and
demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreigners
demand the domestic currency to buy domestic
goods and assets. Domestic residents supply the
domestic currency to obtain the foreign currency
needed to buy foreign goods and assets.
5. Other factors held constant, an increase in domestic
output leads domestic residents to demand more
imports, reducing the country’s net exports and
depreciating its exchange rate. An increase in the
domestic real interest rate makes domestic assets
more attractive, increasing the demand for the
domestic currency and appreciating the exchange
rate; the higher exchange rate in turn reduces net
exports. The effects of changes in foreign output and
the foreign real interest rate on the domestic coun-
try’s net exports and exchange rate are the opposite
of the effects of changes in domestic output and the
domestic real interest rate.
6. The IS–LM model for an open economy is similar to
that for the closed economy. The principal difference
is that, in the open-economy IS–LM model, factors
(other than output or the real interest rate) that
increase a country’s net exports cause the IS curve to
shift up. Among the factors that increase net exports
are a rise in foreign output, an increase in the foreign
real interest rate, and a shift in world demand toward
the domestic country’s goods. Economic shocks or
policy changes are transmitted from one country to
another by changes in net exports that lead to IS
curve shifts.
7. In an open economy with ﬂexible exchange rates, a
ﬁscal expansion increases domestic output, domestic
prices, and the domestic real interest rate, as in a
closed economy. The effect on the exchange rate is
ambiguous. The increase in output raises the demand
for imported goods, which weakens the exchange
rate, but the higher real interest rate makes domestic
assets more attractive, which strengthens the
exchange rate. Because increased output raises the
demand for imports, net exports fall. The ﬁscal expan-
sion is transmitted to the foreign country by the
increase in demand for the foreign country’s exports.
8. In an open economy with flexible exchange rates,
changes in the money supply are neutral in the basic
classical model. Changes in the money supply also
are neutral in the long run in the Keynesian model. In
the short run in the Keynesian model, however, a
decrease in the domestic money supply reduces
domestic output and raises the domestic real interest
rate, causing the current real exchange rate to appre-
ciate. Net exports by the domestic country increase, if
the effect of lower output (which increases net
exports) is stronger than the effect of the rise in the
real exchange rate (which tends to reduce net
exports). The monetary contraction is transmitted to
the foreign country by the effect on the foreign coun-
try’s net exports, which decline.
9. In a ﬁxed-exchange-rate system, nominal exchange
rates are ofﬁcially determined. If the ofﬁcially deter-
mined exchange rate is greater than the fundamental
value of the exchange rate as determined by supply
and demand in the foreign exchange market, the
exchange rate is said to be overvalued. The central
bank can maintain the exchange rate at an overval-
ued level for a time by using ofﬁcial reserves (such as
gold or foreign-currency bank deposits) to buy its
own currency in the foreign exchange market. A
country that tries to maintain an overvalued
exchange rate for too long will run out of reserves
and be forced to devalue its currency. If financial
investors expect a devaluation, they may sell large
quantities of domestic assets (a speculative run). A
speculative run increases the supply of the domestic
currency in the foreign exchange market and increas-
es the rate at which the central bank must pay out its
reserves.
10. To raise the fundamental value of its exchange rate,
the central bank can tighten monetary policy. There is
only one value of the domestic money supply at
which the fundamental value of the exchange rate
equals its ofﬁcially ﬁxed rate. With ﬁxed exchange
rates, individual countries aren’t free to use expan-
sionary monetary policies to ﬁght recessions because
such policies result in an overvalued exchange rate.
However, a group of countries in a ﬁxed-exchange-
rate system can use expansionary monetary policies
effectively if they coordinate their policies.
11. The advantages of a ﬁxed-exchange-rate system are
that it may promote economic and ﬁnancial integra-
tion among countries and that it imposes discipline
on the monetary policies of individual countries. A
fixed-exchange-rate system won’t work well if
member countries have different macroeconomic
policy goals or face different macroeconomic distur-
bances and thus are unable or unwilling to coordi-
nate their monetary policies.

NUMERICAL PROBLEMS
All numerical problems are available in 
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. West Bubble makes ordinary soap bars that are sold for 5
guilders each. East Bubble makes deluxe soap bars that
are sold for 100 ﬂorins each. The real exchange rate
between West and East Bubble is two ordinary soap bars
per deluxe soap bar.
a. What is the nominal exchange rate between the
two countries?
b. During the following year West Bubble has 10%
domestic inﬂation and East Bubble has 20% domes-
tic inﬂation. Two ordinary soap bars are still traded
for a deluxe soap bar. At the end of the year what
has happened to the nominal exchange rate?
Which country has had a nominal appreciation?
Which has had a nominal depreciation?
2. Japan produces and exports only cameras, and Saudi
Arabia produces and exports only barrels of oil. Initially ,
Japan exports 40 cameras to Saudi Arabia and imports 64
barrels of oil. The real exchange rate is 4 barrels of oil per
camera. Neither country has any other trading partners.
a. Initially, what is the real value of Japan’s net
exports, measured in terms of its domestic good?
(Hint: You have to use the real exchange rate to
express Japan’s oil imports in terms of an equiva-
lent number of cameras. Then calculate Japan’s net
exports as the number of cameras exported minus
the real value of its imports in terms of cameras.)
b. The real exchange rate falls to 3 barrels of oil per
camera. Although the decline in the real exchange
rate makes oil more expensive in terms of cameras,
in the short run there is relatively little change in
the quantities of exports and imports, as Japan’s
exports rise to 42 cameras and its imports fall to 60
barrels of oil. What has happened to the real value
of Japan’s net exports?
c. In the longer run, quantities of exports and imports
adjust more to the drop in the real exchange rate
from 4 to 3, and Japan’s exports rise to 45 cameras
and its imports of oil fall to 54 barrels. What are
Japan’s real net exports now?
d. Relate your answers to Parts (b) and (c) to the 
J-curve concept.

the real interest rate, real exchange rate, consump-
tion, investment, and net exports?

940 and that government purchases increase to 132.
What are the equilibrium values of the real interest
rate, real exchange rate, consumption, investment,
and net exports?

values of output, the real interest rate, consump-
tion, investment, net exports, and the price level?

chases are increased by 62, to 214. What are the
effects of this change on output, the real interest
rate, consumption, investment, net exports, and the
price level in the short run? In the long run?

This economy produces only wine, its output is
measured in terms of wine, and its currency is francs. It
trades with a country that produces only cheese, and
the currency of that country is crowns. The real
exchange rate, e, equals 5 wedges of cheese per bottle
of wine. The foreign price level is 20 crowns per wedge
of cheese, and the domestic money supply is 48 francs.
a. What is the domestic price level? What is the fun-
damental value of the (nominal) exchange rate?
b. Suppose that the domestic country fixes its
exchange rate at 50 crowns per franc. Is its curren-
cy overvalued, undervalued, or neither? What will

supply achieves this goal? (Hint: For the given real
exchange rate and foreign price level, what domes-
tic price level is consistent with the ofﬁcial rate?
What domestic money supply level will yield this
price level?)

ﬁnd the values of all the parameters of Eqs. (13.B.1),
(13.B.2), and (13.B.3). Use Eqs. (13.B.8) and (13.B.9)
to derive the open-economy IS curve for this
economy.

d. Derive the AD curve for this economy. Suppose
that net exports increase by 62 at any given level of
domestic output and the domestic interest rate.
How is the AD curve affected?
e. Find the effect of the increase in net exports on
output in this economy, assuming that the price
level is ﬁxed at the general equilibrium value you
found in Part (c). (Hint: This assumption is equiva-
lent to assuming that the SRAS curve is horizontal.)
ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. Recessions often lead to calls for protectionist measures
to preserve domestic jobs. Suppose that a country that
is in a recession imposes restrictions that sharply
reduce the amount of goods imported by the country.
a. Using the Keynesian IS–LM model, analyze the
effects of import restrictions on the domestic coun-
try’s employment, output, real interest rate, and real
exchange rate, keeping in mind that the country is
initially in a recession.
b. What are the effects of the country’s action on for-
eign employment, output, real interest rate, and real
exchange rate? What happens if the foreign country
retaliates by imposing restrictions on goods export-
ed by the domestic country?
c. Suppose that the domestic economy is at full
employment when it imposes restrictions on
imports. Using the basic classical model without
misperceptions, find the effects on the country’s
employment, output, real interest rate, and real
exchange rate.
2. Use the classical IS–LM model for two countries to ana-
lyze the idea that the United States became a relatively
more attractive place to invest in the early 1980s.
Assume that, because of more favorable tax laws, the
user cost of capital falls in the domestic country and
that, because of the LDC debt crisis, the expected future
marginal product of capital falls in the foreign country.
Show that these changes lead to an appreciation of the
home country’s real exchange rate and a drop in the
domestic country’s net exports. Assume no change in
current productivity or current labor supply in either
country. What is happening to ﬁnancial ﬂows? Why?
3. East Bubble’s main trading partner is West Bubble. To
fight inflation, West Bubble undertakes a contrac-
tionary monetary policy.
a. What is the effect of West Bubble’s contractionary
monetary policy on East Bubble’s real exchange rate
in the short run, assuming no change in East Bubble’s
policies? In the long run? Use the Keynesian model
with ﬂexible exchange rates.

518 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
b. What is the effect of West Bubble’s monetary con-
traction on East Bubble’s nominal exchange rate in
the short run and in the long run?
c. Suppose now that East Bubble has ﬁxed its exchange
rate with West Bubble. If East Bubble wants to keep
the exchange rate equal to its fundamental value,
how will East Bubble have to respond to West
Bubble’s monetary tightening? What will happen to
East Bubble’s output, real exchange rate, and net
exports in the short run if it maintains the fixed
exchange rate at its fundamental value? Compare
your answer to that for Part (a).
d. Suppose that, after West Bubble’s monetary tight-
ening, East Bubble decides not to change any of its
own macroeconomic policies (the exchange rate is
still ﬁxed). What will happen? Describe some alter-
native scenarios.
4. Use a diagram like that in Fig. 13.7a to analyze the
effect on a country’s net exports of a beneﬁcial supply
shock that temporarily raises full-employment output
by 100 per person. Assume that the basic classical
model applies so that income is always at its 
full-employment level.
a. Suppose that, in response to the temporary
increase in income, the residents of the country
do not change the amount they desire to spend at
any real interest rate (on either domestic or for-
eign goods). What is the effect of the supply shock
on the country’s net exports? (Hint: What is the
effect of the increase in income on the curve rep-
resenting desired saving minus desired invest-
ment? What is the effect on the curve representing
net exports?)
b. Now suppose that, in response to a temporary
increase in income, the residents of the country
increase their desired spending at any real interest
rate by 100 per person. A portion of this increased
spending is for foreign-produced goods. What is the
effect on the country’s net exports?
c. More difﬁcult: If the increase in income is tempo-
rary, would the spending behavior assumed in
Part (a) or the spending behavior assumed in Part (b)
be more likely to occur? Based on your answer, do
the results of this problem conﬁrm or contradict the
prediction of the model in Chapter 5 of the response
of net exports to a supply shock? Explain.
WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. The United States left the Bretton Woods fixed-
exchange-rate system in stages during the early 1970s.
a. Graph the U.S. nominal exchange rate from 1973 to
the present. Calculate and graph the U.S. real
exchange rate from 1973 to the present, using the
CPI of Canada (the largest trading partner of the
United States) for the “foreign” price level and the
U.S. CPI for the domestic price level. (Data on
Canada’s CPI may be found at www.statcan.ca/
start.html.) Comparing the two graphs, would you
say that real exchange-rate ﬂuctuations arise pri-
marily from nominal exchange-rate ﬂuctuations or
from changes in domestic and foreign price levels?
b. The theory says that higher U.S. real interest rates,
by making dollar assets more attractive, ought to
strengthen the dollar (all else equal). Add the real
interest rate (the three-month Treasury bill rate
minus the inﬂation rate) to a graph that includes
the nominal and real exchange rates. (You may
have to rescale some of the variables so that they
are on approximately the same scale on the graph.)
Do you see the hypothesized relationship between
the real interest rate and the exchange rates?
2. Using quarterly data since 1973, graph the U.S. real
exchange rate (as calculated in Exercise 1) and net
exports as a fraction of GDP in the same ﬁgure. Also
create a scatter plot of the same two variables. Is the the-
oretically predicted relationship of the real exchange rate
and net exports visible in the ﬁgures?
3. Plot the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rela-
tive to the U.S. dollar from January 1981 to the present.
Was the Hong Kong dollar generally appreciating or
depreciating relative to the U.S. dollar between 1981
and late 1983? What happened after 1983? Research
and ﬁnd an explanation for the value of the exchange
rate after 1983.

Worked-Out Numerical Exercise for 
the Open-Economy IS–LM Model
To help you work through the algebra needed for numerical problems in this chapter,
here is a worked-out numerical exercise as an example for solving the open-economy
IS-LM model.
Consider an economy that is described by the following equations:
Find the short-run and long-run equilibrium values of Y, P, r, T, C, I, NX, and i.
To solve this problem, we follow these steps:
Step 1: Find the equation for the IS curve by using the goods market equilibrium
condition. The goods market equilibrium condition is 
Substitute the equation for T into the equation for C
d
from above. Then substi-
tute the resulting equation and the equations for I
d
and NX from above along
with the values of G, , and into to obtain:
Y {140 0.8[Y (400 0.1Y)] 200r} [1000 700r] 400 [50 
0.07Y (0.15 4000) 100r (400 0.2)].
Rearrange this equation as an equation for r in terms of Y:
Y {140 0.8Y [(0.8 400) (0.8 0.1Y)] 200r} [1000 700r] 
+ 400 [50 0.07Y 600 100r 80],
so
Y [140 0.8Y 320 0.08Y 200r] [1000 700r] 
+ 400 [50 0.07Y 600 100r 80],
so
so
1000r 1950 0.35Y.
Therefore, r 1950 /1000 (0.35/1000)Y, so
r 1.95 0.00035Y.
This is the IS curve.

Step 2: Find the equation for the LM curve by using the asset market equilibrium
condition.
a. First ﬁnd the equation for the LM curve with an unspeciﬁed value of the price
level. The asset market equilibrium condition equates real money supply to
real money demand. Real money demand is given by L 0.5Y 1000i
0.5Y 1000(r + p
e
) 0.5Y 1000(r + 0.17), and real money supply is
M/P 489,900/ P. In asset market equilibrium, 489,900/P 0.5Y 1000(r +
0.17), so 1000r 0.5Y 170 489,900/P. Therefore, r (0.5/1000)Y -
(170/1000) (489,900/1000)/P, so r 0.0005Y 0.17 489.9/ P. This is the
equation of the LM curve for an unspeciﬁed value of P.
b. Then ﬁnd the equation for the LM curve when PP

Step 3: Find the short-run equilibrium.
a. Find the intersection of the IS and LM curves to ﬁnd the short-run equilibri-
um values of Y and r. We have written the equations of the IS and LM curves
so that the left side of each equation is simply r. Setting the right side of the
IS curve equal to the right side of the LM curve yields 1.95 0.00035Y
0.0005Y 2.47, so 4.42 0.00085Y. Therefore, Y 4.42/0.00085 5200.
Now use the value of Y in either the IS or the LM curve. In the IS curve: r
1.95 0.00035Y 1.95 (0.00035 5200) 1.95 1.82 0.13. In the LM
curve: r 0.0005Y 2.47 (0.0005 5200) 2.47 2.60 2.47 0.13.
b. Plug these equilibrium values of Y and r into other equations to ﬁnd equi-
librium values for T, C, I, NX, and i.

An Algebraic Version of the 
Open-Economy IS–LM Model
The IS–LM model for the open economy is basically the same as the closed-
economy IS–LM model derived in Appendix 9.B, with the exception that the goods
market equilibrium condition (the IS curve) is expanded to include net exports. The
LM curve and the FE line are unchanged from previous analyses.
To derive the IS curve for the open economy, we begin with the equations
describing desired consumption and desired investment, Eqs. (9.B.8) and (9.B.10):

Equation (13.B.1) shows that desired consumption depends positively on disposable
income, YT , and negatively on the real interest rate, r. (In Eq. 13.B.1 we used Eq.
9.B.9 to substitute for taxes, T.) Equation (13.B.2) states that desired investment
depends negatively on the real interest rate, r. Other factors inﬂuencing desired con-
sumption and desired investment are included in the constant terms c
0
and i
0
, respec-
tively.
In an open economy net exports also are a source of demand for domestic
output. We assume that net exports are

try’s net exports depend negatively on domestic income, Y (increased domestic
income raises spending on imports), and positively on foreign income, Y
For
(increased
foreign income raises spending on exports). Net exports also depend negatively on the
domestic real interest rate, r (a higher real interest rate appreciates the real exchange
rate, making domestic goods relatively more expensive), and positively on the foreign
real interest rate, r
For
(a higher foreign real interest rate depreciates the domestic coun-
try’s real exchange rate). Other factors inﬂuencing net exports, such as the qualities of
domestic and foreign goods, are reﬂected in the constant term x

in Eq. (13.B.3).

We use the open-economy IS curve equation, Eq. (13.B.7), to conﬁrm the three
points made about the curve in the text. First, it slopes downward (the slope of the
IS curve is - , which is negative). Second, any factor that shifts the closed-
economy IS curve also shifts the open-economy IS curve (any factor that changes
the intercept 
IS
also changes the intercept in the same direction). Finally, for a
given output and real interest rate, any factor that increases net exports shifts the
open-economy IS curve up. That is, an increase in Y

intercept term and thus shifts the IS curve up.
General equilibrium in the open-economy IS–LM model is determined as in the
closed-economy model, except that the open-economy IS curve (Eq. 13.B.7) replaces the
closed-economy IS curve (Eq. 9.B.14). Similarly , classical and Keynesian AD–AS analy-
sis in the open economy is the same as in the closed economy (Appendix 9.B), except
that the coefﬁcients

and P.
To illustrate the use of Eqs. (13.B.10) and (13.B.11), let’s consider the effects of
a monetary expansion in the Keynesian model. In the short run an increase in the
money supply raises domestic output, Y, lowers the domestic real interest rate, r,
and leaves the domestic price level, P, unchanged. For these changes, Eqs. (13.B.10)
and (13.B.11)—holding constant foreign output, Y
For
, and the foreign real interest
rate, r

—imply a lower real exchange rate, e, and a lower nominal exchange rate,
e
nom
(both a real and a nominal depreciation). In the long run money is neutral, so
Y and r return to their original levels. Equation (13.B.10) indicates therefore that the
real exchange rate, e, also returns to its original value in the long run. However, a
monetary expansion leads to a long-run increase in the domestic price level, P.
Hence Eq. (13.B.11) shows that the nominal exchange rate, e
nom
, also depreciates in
the long run.

CHAPTER 14
Monetary Policy and the
Federal Reserve System
Monetary policy—the government’s decisions about how much money to supply
to the economy—is one of the two principal tools available for affecting macroeco-
nomic behavior. (The other, ﬁscal policy, is discussed in Chapter 15.) Monetary
policy decisions have widespread implications for the economy. The macroeco-
nomic models that we have presented predict that changes in the money supply
will affect nominal variables such as the price level and the nominal exchange
rate. In addition, theories that allow for nonneutrality (including the extended
classical theory with misperceptions and the Keynesian theory) imply that, in the
short run, monetary policy also affects real variables such as real GDP, the real
interest rate, and the unemployment rate. Because monetary policy has such per-
vasive economic effects, the central bank’s announcements and actions are closely
monitored by the media, ﬁnancial market participants, and the general public.
In this chapter we look more closely at monetary policy, concentrating ﬁrst on
the basic question of how the nation’s money supply is determined. We demon-
strate that, although a nation’s central bank (the Federal Reserve System in the
United States) can exert strong inﬂuence over the level of the money supply, the
money supply also is affected by the banking system’s behavior and the public’s
decisions. We then explain why the Federal Reserve and many other central banks
now target interest rates, rather than the money supply.
In the second part of the chapter, we explore the question: How should the cen-
tral bank conduct monetary policy? Not surprisingly, because of classical and Key-
nesian differences over the effects of monetary policy and the desirability of trying
to smooth the business cycle (Chapters 10 and 11), the question is controversial.
Keynesians usually argue that monetary authorities should have considerable lat-
itude to try to offset cyclical ﬂuctuations. Opposing the Keynesian view, both clas-
sical economists and a group of economists called monetarists believe that monetary
policy shouldn’t be left to the discretion of the central bank but instead should be
governed by simple rules. Although establishing rules for monetary policy might
seem to tie policymakers’ hands unnecessarily, monetarists and classicals argue
that the use of rules would lead to a more stable and less inﬂationary economy in
the long run. After examining the arguments for and against the use of rules, we
discuss the effectiveness of rules-based monetary policies in the United States and
other countries. We also discuss how the debate about rules is related to questions
of how monetary policymaking institutions should be designed. For example,
M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:56 AM  Page 525
526 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
should the central bank be largely independent from the rest of the government, or
should it be more directly controlled by the executive and legislative branches?
14.1 Principles of Money Supply Determination
How is the nation’s money supply determined? So far we have assumed that the
money supply, M, is controlled directly by the central bank. Although this
assumption is a useful simplification, it isn’t literally true. The central bank’s
control of the money supply is only indirect and depends to some extent on the
structure of the economy.
Most generally, three groups affect the money supply: the central bank, depos-
itory institutions, and the public.
1. In nearly all countries the central bank is the government institution responsi-
ble for monetary policy.
1
Examples of central banks are the Federal Reserve
System in the United States, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan.
2. Depository institutions are privately owned banks and thrift institutions (such
as savings and loan associations) that accept deposits from and make loans
directly to the public. We refer to depository institutions as banks, for short.
3. The public includes every person or ﬁrm (except banks) that holds money, ei-
ther as currency and coin or as deposits in banks—in other words, virtually
the whole private economy outside the banking system.
Let’s consider a simpliﬁed example of the U.S. economy, where the currency is
dollars and the central bank is the Federal Reserve (the “Fed,” for short), though
our discussion in this section is more general and could apply to almost any cur-
rency and any central bank.
Suppose the Fed’s balance sheet looks like this:
On the left side of the balance sheet are the Fed’s assets—what it owns or is owed.
In this case, the assets are securities and gold. Typically, securities are U.S. Treasury
bills, notes, and bonds, which are liabilities of the U.S. Treasury and assets of the
Fed, just as, say, U.S. Treasury bonds held by an investor are liabilities of the U.S.
Treasury and assets of the investor. During the recent ﬁnancial crisis, the Fed broad-
ened the scope of the securities on its balance sheet to include mortgage-backed
securities and loans to ﬁnancial ﬁrms. On the right side of the balance sheet are the
1
Most industrialized countries established central banks in the nineteenth century or early twentieth
century. Prior to the establishment of central banks, national treasury departments often were respon-
sible for currency issue and other matters pertaining to the money supply.

M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:56 AM  Page 526
Chapter 14 Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve System 527
Fed’s liabilities—what it owes to others. Currency issued by the Fed and held
either by the nonbank public or in vaults of private-sector banks is a debt obligation
of the Fed and is thus entered as a liability in the Fed’s balance sheet. Reserve
deposits are deposit accounts at the Fed that are owned by banks. These deposits
are liabilities of the Fed and assets of private-sector banks. The sum of reserve
deposits and currency (including both currency held by the nonbank public and
vault cash held by banks) is called the monetary base, or, equivalently, high-
powered money. The monetary base in this example is $1000.
Next, consider the balance sheets of banks in the private sector. We will com-
bine all the banks together. Suppose their consolidated balance sheet looks like this:
The banks’ assets consist of vault cash of $100 (the same $100 that appears as a lia-
bility on the Fed’s balance sheet), reserve deposits of $200 (the same $200 that
appears as a liability on the Fed’s balance sheet), plus loans of $2700 that banks
have extended to the nonbank public. The banks’ liabilities consist of $3000
deposits held by the nonbank public. For instance, if you have a checking account
at your local bank, that checking account is one of your assets and it appears on
your bank’s balance sheet as a liability.
Liquid assets held by banks to meet the demands for withdrawals by depos-
itors or to pay the checks drawn on depositors’ accounts are called bank reserves.
Bank reserves comprise currency held by banks in their vaults and deposits held
by banks at the Fed, so bank reserves in this example total $300 ($100 of vault cash
plus $200 of reserve deposits). Until very recently, banks in the United States did
not earn any interest on their reserves: currency held as vault cash, of course,
does not earn interest, and the Fed did not pay interest on reserve deposits that
banks held at the Fed. But beginning in October 2008, the Fed began to pay inter-
est on reserves, as we discuss in more detail in section 14.2, though the interest rate
on reserves has been very low. When banks have creditworthy customers seeking
to borrow money from them, they can generally earn more income by lending
some of their assets to these borrowers rather than holding all of their assets as
reserves. Because banks lend out some of their deposits, the reserves held by a
bank equal only a fraction of its outstanding deposits. In our example, the
reserve–deposit ratio, or reserves divided by deposits, equals 10% because
reserves equal $300 and deposits equal $3000. A banking system in which the
reserve–deposit ratio is less than 1 is called fractional reserve banking. The alter-
native to fractional reserve banking is 100% reserve banking, in which bank
reserves equal 100% of deposits. Under 100% reserve banking, banks are nothing
more than a safekeeping service for the public’s currency. If the central bank pays
zero or very low interest on reserve deposits, the only way that banks could cover
their expenses and make a proﬁt under 100% reserve banking would be to charge
depositors a fee for holding their money for them (that is, to pay negative interest
on deposits).

Open-Market Operations
Suppose the Fed wanted to increase the amount of money in the economy. It
could do so by buying securities from private investors in the bond market. For
example, suppose that the Fed buys $100 of securities from Barclays Capital,
which is a government securities dealer that maintains its bank accounts at Bar-
clays Bank. The Fed receives $100 in securities from Barclays Capital and pays for
these securities by increasing Barclays Bank’s deposit account at the Fed by $100.
Barclays Bank then increases Barclays Capital deposit at Barclays Bank by $100.
As a result of this transaction, the securities on the left side of the Fed’s balance
sheet increase by $100 to $1000 and banks’ reserve deposits on the right side of
the Fed’s balance sheet increase by $100 to $300. On the asset side of the consol-
idated balance sheet of banks, reserve deposits rise by $100, and on the liabilities
side, deposits rise by $100 to capture the additional $100 in the deposit account of
Barclays Capital. After all of these transactions, the Fed’s and the banks’ balance
sheets are as follows:
As the bankers examine their balance sheets, they note that their reserves (vault
cash plus reserve deposits) are $400, while their deposits equal $3100. If the banks
want to maintain a reserve–deposit ratio of 10% (which was its value before the
purchase of bonds by the Fed), they would need only 0.1 : $3100, or $310 of
reserves. Since they have $400 in reserves, they can lend $400 - $310 = $90 to earn
additional interest.
Suppose that Barclays Bank lends $90 to Anne, who uses to the loan to buy
some goods from Paul. Paul then deposits the $90 in his bank. (We are assuming at
this point that Paul wants to hold all the additional funds as bank deposits and
does not want to hold any additional currency; we consider the more general case
in the section on the money multiplier, pp. 529–532.) The $90 loan to Anne will
increase the loans on the banks’ balance sheet by $90 to $2790, and when Paul
deposits the $90 in his bank, the banks’ deposits increase by $90 to $3190. (The
reserves of the banking system are not changed, as the $90 is essentially transferred
from Anne’s bank to Paul’s bank.) At this point the consolidated balance sheet of all
the banks is:
Federal Reserve Bank
Assets Liabilities
Securities $1000 Currency held by nonbank public $  700
Gold 100 Vault cash held by banks 100
Reserve deposits 300

The process doesn’t stop here. Looking at their balance sheets after this latest
round of loans and deposits, the bankers ﬁnd that their reserves ($400) still exceed
10% of their deposits, or 0.10 : $3190 = $319. So yet another round of loans and
deposits of loaned funds will occur.
This process of multiple expansion of loans and deposits, in which fraction-
al reserve banking increases an economy’s loans and deposits, will stop only when
the reserves of the banking system equal 10% of its deposits. The reserves of the
banks always equal $400 at the end of each round,
2
so the process will stop when
total bank deposits equal $400/0.10, or $4000. At this ﬁnal point the consolidated
balance sheet of the banks is:
At this ﬁnal stage, the ratio of reserves to deposits equals the ratio desired by
banks (10%). No further expansion of loans and deposits will occur after this point.
Notice that the purchase of $100 in securities by the Fed led to additional
deposits in the banking system of $1000 and additional loans of $900. Recall
(Chapter 7) that a purchase of assets by the central bank is called an open-market
purchase.
3
It increases the monetary base and thus the money supply. A sale of
assets to the public by the central bank is called an open-market sale. It reduces the
monetary base and the money supply. Open-market purchases and sales collec-
tively are called open-market operations. Open-market operations are the most
direct way for central banks to change their national money supplies.
The Money Multiplier
The Fed uses open-market operations to change the size of the monetary base. In
general, a one-dollar increase in the monetary base increases the money supply by
more than one dollar. We examine the relationship between the monetary base
2
The reserves held by the banking system remain unchanged at $400 at the end of each round
because, in this example, we have assumed that the proceeds of any loan are fully redeposited in the
banking system so that the public does not increase its holdings of currency. As we have mentioned,
we will take account of any changes in currency holdings in the section on the money multiplier, 
pp. 529–532.
3
The term open-market means that the central bank’s transactions take place in regular asset markets in
which government securities dealers compete with each other to trade securities with the central bank.

and the money supply to see how large an increase in the money supply results
from a one-dollar increase in the monetary base. We use the following variables to
study this relationship:
M = the money supply;
BASE = the monetary base;
DEP = total bank deposits;
RES = total bank reserves;
CU = currency held by the nonbank public.
res = the banks’ desired reserve–deposit ratio, RES /DEP;
cu = the public’s desired currency–deposit ratio, CU/DEP.
Currency in the public’s hands and bank deposits both may be used for trans-
actions, so both are forms of money. When the public holds both currency, CU, and
bank deposits, DEP , the money supply, M, is
(14.1)
The monetary base has two uses: Some of the monetary base is held as curren-
cy by the public, and the rest is held as reserves by banks. Therefore the monetary
base equals the sum of the two, or
(14.2)
The Fed controls the amount of monetary base but doesn’t directly control the
money supply. To relate the money supply to the monetary base, we ﬁrst divide the
money supply, Eq. (14.1), by the monetary base, Eq. (14.2), to get
(14.3)
Next, we divide both the numerator and the denominator on the right side of
Eq. (14.3) by DEP to obtain
(14.4)
The right side of Eq. (14.4) contains two important ratios. The first is the
currency–deposit ratio (CU/DEP), which is the ratio of the currency held by the
public to the public’s deposits in banks. The currency–deposit ratio is determined
by the public and depends on the amount of money the public wants to hold as
currency versus the amount it wants to hold as deposits. The public can raise the
currency–deposit ratio to any level that it wants by withdrawing currency from
banks (which increases currency held and reduces deposits); similarly, by deposit-
ing currency in banks, the public can lower the currency–deposit ratio.
The second important ratio on the right side of Eq. (14.4) is the reserve–deposit
ratio (RES/DEP), which we’ve already discussed. The reserve–deposit ratio is
determined by banks’ decisions about how much of their deposits to lend.
4
When the process of multiple expansion of loans and deposits is complete,
the currency–deposit ratio equals the ratio desired by the public, cu, and the

As we discuss later in this chapter, government regulations may set minimum levels for banks’
reserve–deposit ratios.
M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:56 AM  Page 530
Chapter 14 Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve System 531
reserve–deposit ratio equals the ratio desired by the banks, res. Substituting cu for
CU/DEP and res for RES/DEP in Eq. (14.4) and multiplying both sides of Eq.
(14.4) by BASE, we obtain
(14.5)
Equation (14.5) states that the money supply is a multiple of the monetary
base. The relationship of the money supply to the monetary base depends on the
currency–deposit ratio chosen by the public and the reserve–deposit ratio chosen
by banks. The factor (cu + 1)/(cu + res), which is the number of dollars of money
supply that can be created from each dollar of monetary base, is called the money
multiplier. The money multiplier will be greater than 1 as long as res is less than 1
(that is, with fractional reserve banking). In this case, each additional dollar of
monetary base will increase the money supply by more than one dollar, which is
why the monetary base is also known as high-powered money.
The money multiplier in Eq. (14.5) can be applied to any deﬁnition of the
money supply, such as M1 or M2. Since M1 is the sum of currency held by the non-
bank public and transactions deposits, we would use transactions deposits as the
measure of deposits in computing cu and res in the M1 money multiplier. M2 is the
sum of currency held by the nonbank public and a broader measure of deposits
including savings as well as transactions deposits, and we would use the broader
measure of deposits in computing cu and res in the M2 money multiplier.
Table 14.1 uses U.S. data to illustrate the money multiplier and the relation-
ships among currency, reserves, monetary base, and the money supply. With these
data, you can verify that the currency–deposit ratio is 0.1139 and that the reserve–
deposit ratio is 0.1084. Thus the money multiplier (cu + 1)/(cu + res), equals 5.01.
You may verify this formula by dividing the money supply ($8347.9 billion) by the
monetary base ($1666.2 billion) to obtain 5.01.
5
It can be shown algebraically that the money multiplier decreases when either
the currency–deposit ratio, cu, or the reserve–deposit ratio, res, increases.
6
Recall
that the reason that the monetary base gets “multiplied” is that, under fractional
reserve banking, banks use some of the currency received as deposits to make
loans to the public. The public can either hold the money it borrows from banks as
currency or redeposit its borrowings in the banking system, but in either case the
result is a higher total money supply than existed before the loans were made.
When the reserve–deposit ratio rises, banks lend a smaller fraction of each dollar of
deposits, creating less money for the same amount of monetary base; thus an
M = a 
cu + 1
cu + res
 bBASE.
5
The numbers in Table 14.1 are for the M2 measure of the money supply. We can also calculate a mul-
tiplier for the M1 measure of the money supply. Before the recent ﬁnancial crisis, the M1 multiplier
was also larger than one. However, as explained in footnote 6, the M1 multiplier fell below one
during the recent ﬁnancial crisis.
6
That the money multiplier decreases when cu increases is not obvious, as cu appears in both the
numerator and the denominator of the money multiplier. However, as you can conﬁrm by trying
numerical examples or by taking a derivative, an increase in cu reduces the money multiplier as long
as res is less than 1 and the money multiplier is greater than 1. With fractional reserve banking, the
condition is generally satisﬁed. However, during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, this condition was not satis-
ﬁed for M1. For instance, in July 2009, reserves were $812.7 billion and transactions deposits were
$800.8 billion, so res equalled 1.0149. In this case, with cu = 1.0658, the money multiplier was 0.99.
However, as Table 14.1 shows, the broader deﬁnition of deposits was $7494.4 billion, so that using
this deﬁnition of deposits, res was 0.1084, cu was 0.1139, and the money multiplier was 5.01.

increase in the reserve–deposit ratio lowers the money multiplier. When the
currency–deposit ratio rises, the public puts a smaller fraction of its money in
banks, which means that banks have less money to lend. With banks lending less,
less money is created from the same amount of monetary base, again reducing the
money multiplier.
Bank Runs
Fractional reserve banking works on the assumption that outﬂows and inﬂows of
reserves will roughly balance, and in particular that a large fraction of a bank’s
depositors will never want to withdraw their funds at the same time. If a large
number of depositors attempt to withdraw currency simultaneously (more than
10% of the bank’s deposits in the example on p. 527), the bank will run out of
reserves and be unable to meet all its depositors’ demands for cash.
Historically in the United States, there have been episodes in which rumors cir-
culated that a particular bank had made some bad loans and was at risk of becom-
ing bankrupt. On the principle of “better safe than sorry,” the bank’s depositors
lined up to withdraw their money. From the depositors’ perspective, withdrawal
avoided the risk that the bank would fail and not be able to pay off depositors in
full. A large-scale, panicky withdrawal of deposits from a bank is called a bank run.
Even if the rumors about the bank’s loans proved untrue, a large enough run could
exhaust the bank’s reserves and force it to close.
7
To prevent future bank runs from occurring, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) was established in 1933 to provide deposit insurance.
Deposit insurance guarantees that depositors will not lose the money they hold
in an insured bank account (up to some limit) even if the bank were to go bank-
rupt. As a result, depositors would have no incentive to start a bank run. The
FDIC obtains the funds needed to provide such insurance by charging an insur-
ance premium to banks. Further, the Federal government effectively stands
7
To stop a run, a bank had to convince customers that it was “sound”—ﬁnancially solvent—and had
plenty of funds available. This was Jimmy Stewart’s strategy in the movie It’s A Wonderful Life.
M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:56 AM  Page 532
Chapter 14 Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve System 533
behind the FDIC, so that if in a crisis the FDIC fund were to become exhausted,
the government would provide any funds needed to prevent losses to depositors
on insured deposits, as it did in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As a result of
deposit insurance, when the ﬁnancial crisis hit in 2008,
8
people poured money
into banks, where their money was insured, instead of out of banks, as occurred
during the Great Depression. See the Application “The Money Multiplier During
Severe Financial Crises.”
APPLICATION
The Money Multiplier During Severe Financial Crises
The money multiplier usually is relatively stable, but not always. During the early
part of the Great Depression and during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, the money
multiplier fell sharply, creating serious problems for monetary policy.
The Money Multiplier During the Great Depression
The source of the instability in the money multiplier, as discussed in detail by Milton
Friedman and Anna Schwartz in their Monetary History of the United States,
1867–1960
9
was a series of severe banking panics. A banking panic is an episode in
which many banks suffer runs by depositors, with some banks being forced to close.
The U.S. panics resulted from both ﬁnancial weakness in the banking system and the
arrival of bad economic and ﬁnancial news. Among the causes of banking panics
emphasized by Friedman and Schwartz were: (1) the effects of falling agricultural
prices on the economies of farm states in the autumn of 1930; (2) the failure in Decem-
ber 1930 of a large New York bank called the Bank of United States (a private bank,
despite its name); (3) the failure in May 1931 of Austria’s largest bank, which led to
a European ﬁnancial crisis; and (4) Great Britain’s abandonment of the gold standard
in September 1931. The most severe banking panic began in January 1933 and was
halted only when the newly inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed
a “bank holiday” that closed all the banks in March 1933. By that time more than one-
third of the banks in the United States had failed or been taken over by other banks.
Banking reforms that were passed as part of Roosevelt’s New Deal legislation
restored conﬁdence in the banking system and halted bank runs after March 1933.
The banking panics affected the money multiplier in two ways. (See Fig. 14.1.)
First, people became very distrustful of banks, fearing that their banks might sud-
denly fail and not be able to pay them the full amounts of their deposits. (These
events occurred before deposits were insured by the Federal government, as they
are today.) Instead of holding bank deposits, people felt safer holding currency,
perhaps under the mattress or in coffee cans buried in the backyard. Conversion
of deposits into currency caused the currency–deposit ratio to rise, as shown in
Fig. 14.1, with a spectacular rise in the ﬁrst quarter of 1933.
8
During the ﬁnancial crisis, the Federal government temporarily increased the FDIC limit on insured
deposits to $250,000 from $100,000, which was the FDIC limit before the crisis.

RESERVE–DEPOSIT RATIO
Second, in anticipation of possible runs, banks began to hold more reserves
(including vault cash) to back their deposits, as shown in Fig. 14.1 by the behavior
of the reserve–deposit ratio. Banks hoped to convince depositors that there was
enough cash in the banks’ vaults to satisfy withdrawals so that the depositors
would not be tempted to start a run.
As discussed earlier, increases in either the currency–deposit ratio or the
reserve–deposit ratio cause the money multiplier to fall. As shown in Fig. 14.2(a),
as a result of the banking panics, the money multiplier fell precipitously, from 6.6
in March 1930 to 3.6 by the bank holiday in March 1933. Thus, even though the
monetary base grew by 20% during that three-year period, the money multiplier
fell by so much that the money supply fell by 35%, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b). There
is some controversy about whether the drop in the money supply was a primary
cause of the decline in output during 1930–1933 (Friedman and Schwartz argue that
it was), but there is general agreement that the drastic decline in the price level (by
about one-third) in this period was the result of the plunge in the money supply.
The Money Multiplier During the Financial Crisis of 2008
Just as banking panics led to a decline in the money multiplier during the Great
Depression, a worldwide ﬁnancial panic (see the Application “The Financial Crisis
of 2008” on pages 552–553) similarly caused the money multiplier to decline in
2008. The presence of deposit insurance on bank accounts led people to sell stocks
and bonds and place the proceeds in bank accounts. As a result, the
currency–deposit ratio actually fell slightly, rather than rising as it had in the Great

Depression (see Fig. 14.3). However, just as in the Great Depression, banks chose to
greatly increase the amount of reserves they held. Reserves were only $45 billion in
July 2008, rose to $103 billion in September, and kept rising rapidly, reaching $901
billion by May 2009. This stunning increase in reserves greatly increased the
reserve–deposit ratio, as shown in Fig. 14.3, from about 0.014 before September
2008 to greater than 0.110 by December 2008.

Currency-deposit ratio and

Why did banks hold so many reserves? One reason is that the Federal Reserve
encouraged them to do so, by beginning to pay interest on reserve holdings in Octo-
ber 2008, as we mentioned earlier. Prior to that, banks tried to hold as few reserves as
possible because they earned no interest. Once the Fed offered to pay interest, banks
had an incentive to hold large amounts of reserves. The Fed thought this arrange-
ment was desirable, as it fostered liquidity in the banking system. Another reason
that bank reserves rose sharply is that the Fed increased the monetary base (see Fig.
14.4(a)) by buying securities in the open market. These open-market purchases led to
large cash inﬂows at banks, but the banks did not have many good lending oppor-
tunities, so they simply added to their reserve deposits at the Fed.
With the reserve–deposit ratio rising signiﬁcantly and not much change in the
currency–deposit ratio, the money multiplier declined sharply, from 8.8 in August
2008 to 4.9 by December 2008, as shown in Fig. 14.4(a). Such a large decline in the
multiplier also occurred during the Great Depression (see Fig. 14.2(a)). However,
the major difference between the 1930s and 2008 is that in the more recent period
the Fed increased the monetary base more than enough to offset the decline in the
money multiplier, so that the money supply rose, as shown in Fig. 14.4(b). The rise
in the money supply in 2008 stands in sharp contrast to the decline in the money
supply in the early 1930s (see Fig. 14.2(b)).
Thus, despite facing the same sharp rise in the reserve–deposit ratio and sig-
niﬁcant decline in the money multiplier, the Fed in 2008 managed to increase the
money supply, unlike in the early 1930s. It is too early to tell whether or not
these actions by the Fed prevented another depression from occurring, but we do
know that the Fed did not repeat its past mistake of letting the money supply fall
sharply.

14.2 Monetary Control in the United States
The principles of money supply determination we described in Section 14.1 apply
fairly generally to central banks and banking systems. In this section we focus on
speciﬁc institutional details of the central bank in the United States, which is the
Federal Reserve System.
The Federal Reserve System
The central bank of the United States is called the Federal Reserve System, or the Fed
for short. It was created by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 and began operation in
1914. One of Congress’s primary motives in establishing the Fed was the hope that a
central bank would help eliminate the severe ﬁnancial crises (combinations of stock
market crashes, business failures, and banking panics) that had periodically afﬂicted
the United States before World War I. Ironically , the most severe ﬁnancial crisis in U.S.
history occurred in 1930–1933, barely a decade and a half after the creation of the Fed.
The Federal Reserve Act established a system of twelve regional Federal
Reserve Banks, each associated with a geographical area called a Federal Reserve
district. The locations of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks are shown in Fig. 14.5.
Technically, the regional Federal Reserve Banks are owned by the private banks
within the district that are members of the Federal Reserve System. All federally
chartered private banks are members of the Federal Reserve System, and state-
chartered banks may join. Whether an individual bank is a member of the system
has ceased to mean much, however, because Congress passed legislation in 1980
extending the responsibilities and privileges of member banks to all banks. Before

1980 member banks faced stricter regulatory requirements than nonmembers but
also had access to some useful services (such as check-clearing services).
The leadership of the Federal Reserve System is provided by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (also called the Federal Reserve Board),
located in Washington, D.C. The Board consists of seven governors, appointed by
the President of the United States to staggered fourteen-year terms, with one of the
governors beginning a new term every other year. The President appoints one
board member to be the chairman of the Board of Governors for a term of four
years. Besides having considerable inﬂuence over monetary policy, the chairman is
an important ﬁgure in ﬁnancial markets (the Fed has partial responsibility for reg-
ulating securities markets and the banking sector) and often is consulted by Con-
gress and the President on matters of national economic policy.
Decisions about monetary policy are the responsibility of the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC consists of the seven governors, the presi-
dent of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the presidents of the other
regional Federal Reserve Banks, who serve on the FOMC on a rotating basis.
10
The
FOMC meets about eight times a year to review the state of the economy and to plan
the conduct of monetary policy . The FOMC can meet more frequently (in person or by
conference call) if developments in the economy seem to warrant discussion. FOMC
decisions to tighten or ease monetary policy are announced immediately after the
meeting and are closely monitored by the press, public, and ﬁnancial markets.
The Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet and Open-Market Operations
The balance sheet of the Federal Reserve System (all Federal Reserve Banks taken
together) as of August 2009 is shown in Table 14.2. The Fed’s largest asset is its
holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, or government bonds. Indeed, the Fed owns
between 5% and 10% of outstanding U.S. government bonds. It also owns gold and
makes loans to banks (depository institutions), which count as Fed assets. During
the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, the Fed began purchasing a variety of assets other than

fully in the discussions, but do not vote on the policy action.

Treasury securities, including bonds issued by Federal agencies and mortgage-
backed securities. It also began to use auctions to lend funds to ﬁnancial institu-
tions, and these loans are known as term auction credit. The category “Other
assets” includes foreign exchange, loans made by the Fed to Bear Stearns and AIG
during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, and other relatively small items.
The largest liability of the Fed is currency outstanding. Some of this currency
($49.4 billion) is held in the vaults of private-sector banks and is known as vault
cash. The remainder of currency outstanding, $860.5 billion, is held by the nonbank
public and corresponds to what we label CU.
The other principal liability of the Fed is deposits made by depository institu-
tions, such as banks, savings and loan associations, and mutual savings banks. In
accepting deposits from depository institutions, the Fed acts as the “banks’ bank.”
Depository institutions make deposits at the Fed because it is a convenient way of
holding reserves. These accounts at the Fed ($833.1 billion), together with vault
cash ($49.4 billion), equal the total reserves of the banking system ($882.5 billion),
which is what we call RES.
Recall from Eq. (14.2) that the monetary base equals bank reserves ($882.5 billion)
plus currency held by the nonbank public ($860.5 billion), or $1743.0 billion. As
shown in Fig. 14.6, the monetary base can be calculated equivalently as the sum of
total currency outstanding ($909.9 billion) plus deposits of depository institutions at
the Fed ($833.1 billion), which again is $1743.0 billion.

The Fed also has other liabilities, including accounts held by the U.S. Treasury and by foreign cen-
tral banks. Because these accounts are not owned by the public or the U.S. banking sector, they aren’t
counted as part of the monetary base.

For the most recent reserve requirements, see Table 1.15 of the Federal Reserve Bulletin.
If the Fed wants to change the money supply, its primary tool is open-market
operations. To increase the money supply, for example, the Fed could conduct an
open-market purchase, in which it would buy U.S. Treasury securities from govern-
ment securities dealers. As we discussed in Section 14.1, this open-market purchase
would increase the monetary base, and the money supply would increase as a result
of the money multiplier. To decrease the money supply, the Fed could conduct an
open-market sale, in which it would sell U.S. Treasury securities to government
securities dealers, which would reduce the monetary base.
Other Means of Controlling the Money Supply
Although open-market operations are the main way that the Fed affects the money
supply, it has three other methods available: changes in reserve requirements, dis-
count window lending, and changes in the interest rate the Fed pays on reserve
deposits held by banks. The effects of these and other factors on the money supply
are listed in Summary table 19.
Reserve Requirements. The Fed sets the minimum fraction of each type of
deposit that banks must hold as reserves. An increase in reserve requirements
forces banks to hold more reserves and increases the reserve–deposit ratio. A
higher reserve–deposit ratio reduces the money multiplier, so an increase in
reserve requirements reduces the money supply for any level of the monetary
base.
Over the past several years the Fed has phased out reserve requirements on
many types of deposits so that, currently, reserve requirements apply only to trans-
actions deposits (primarily checking accounts). As of January 2009, banks were
required to hold reserves equal to 3% of transactions deposits between $10.3 mil-
lion and $44.4 million, and 10% of the transactions deposits over $44.4 million.
12
No
reserves are required for the ﬁrst $10.3 million of transactions deposits.
Discount Window Lending. A principal reason that the Fed was created was
to try to reduce severe ﬁnancial crises. The Fed was supposed to accomplish this
goal mainly by acting as a “lender of last resort”—that is, by standing ready to
lend reserves to banks that need cash to meet depositors’ demands or reserve
requirements. The Fed’s lending of reserves to banks is called discount window
lending, and the interest rate it charges for lending reserves is called the
discount rate.
When the Fed lends reserves to banks through the discount window, it changes
the monetary base. For example, if banks borrow $1 billion from the Fed and
deposit these borrowings in their reserve accounts at the Fed, the Fed’s balance
sheet is affected in two ways: (1) on the asset side, loans to depository institutions
rise by $1 billion; and (2) on the liability side, deposits held by depository institu-
tions also rise by $1 billion, increasing the monetary base by $1 billion. Thus an
increase in borrowing from the discount window raises the monetary base, and a
decrease in discount window borrowing lowers the monetary base.
Starting in 2003, the Fed modiﬁed the way it lends to banks through the dis-
count window. Before 2003, the Fed discouraged banks from borrowing at the
discount window except in emergencies. Doing so required continual supervision
M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:56 AM  Page 541
542 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
of banks to ensure that they were not trying to proﬁt from their loans from the
Fed. However, over time, banks became more reluctant to borrow from the Fed
because investors viewed such borrowing as a sign of poor bank management.
The Fed became concerned that it was losing its role as a lender of last resort and
that banks’ unwillingness to borrow from the discount window was leading to
volatility in interest rates.
In 2003, the Fed created two new borrowing procedures to replace the old one.
Banks in good condition could take out a primary credit discount loan, with no super-
vision by the Fed—a no-questions-asked policy that differed completely from the
old policy. Banks that were not in good condition might also be allowed to borrow,
but they would have to take out a secondary credit discount loan, which carried a
higher interest rate and careful supervision by the Fed. The new policy made banks
a bit more willing to borrow from the Fed, especially in the case of a technical prob-
lem such as a computer failure. The beneﬁt to the Fed of the new policy was a
reduced administrative burden and a built-in procedure to reduce the volatility of
interest rates. Volatility of interest rates is reduced because if interest rates on other
sources of bank funds rose too much, banks would take out more primary credit
discount loans from the Fed (at a ﬁxed interest rate), effectively capping the rise in
those other interest rates.
Changes in the discount rates (both primary and secondary) can be used by
the Fed to inﬂuence the money supply. An increase in the discount rates makes
borrowing at the discount window more costly. If banks reduce their borrowing in
response to the higher discount rates, the monetary base falls. For a constant
money multiplier, a drop in the monetary base implies a decline in the money
supply as well.
Instead of borrowing from the Fed, a bank can borrow reserves from other
banks that have extra reserves. These borrowed funds are called Federal funds, or

The Fed cannot refuse a discount loan to a bank in good condition that qualiﬁes for a primary
credit discount loan, but it can refuse to make a secondary credit discount loan to a weaker bank if it
thinks the bank may not pay off the loan or if it thinks that banks overall have borrowed too much
from the Fed.
Fed funds, and the interest rate charged on these loans is the Fed funds rate.
Despite its name, the Fed funds rate is not an interest rate charged by the Fed; it is
the interest rate charged on loans from one bank to another. Figure 14.7 shows the
behavior of the Fed funds rate and the discount rate. (There was just one discount
rate before 2003, then both a primary and secondary discount rate beginning in Jan-
uary 2003. The ﬁgure shows only the primary credit discount rate.) The Fed funds
rate is a market interest rate determined by the forces of supply and demand,
which changes much more frequently than the discount rate, which the Fed sets.
The Fed funds rate usually exceeded the discount rate before 2003, because banks
were willing to pay a premium to avoid borrowing from the Fed. Beginning in 2003
the Fed set the primary credit discount rate 1.0 percentage point higher than its
target for the Fed funds rate and the secondary credit discount rate even higher (by
an additional 0.5 percentage point). In the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, the difference
between the primary credit discount rate and the Federal funds rate was reduced.
The existence of the discount window doesn’t affect the Fed’s ultimate control
over the monetary base. If the Fed thinks that banks are borrowing too much, it can
discourage borrowing by raising the discount rate or simply refuse to make loans
of secondary credit.
13
Moreover, the Fed can offset any effects of bank borrowing on
the monetary base through open-market operations.

544 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
Interest Rate on Reserves
Beginning in October 2008, the Federal Reserve began to pay interest on banks’
reserve deposits at the Fed. The rationale is that paying interest on reserves would
encourage banks to hold additional reserves, instead of trying to keep their reserves
as low as possible. Banks with large amounts of reserves would be viewed favorably
by depositors, who would know that their deposits were safe. In fact, as discussed
in footnote 6, banks increased their reserves so much that by the summer of 2009
their reserves exceeded their transactions deposits.
Not only did the move to paying interest on reserves lead banks to hold sub-
stantially more reserves, it also gave the Fed an additional tool to use to affect the
money supply. By raising the interest rate on reserves, the Fed can encourage banks
to hold additional reserves, thus reducing the money multiplier and the money
supply.
14
Alternatively, if the Fed wants to increase the money supply, it can do so
by reducing the interest rate it pays on reserves, causing the reserve–deposit ratio
to decline, thus increasing the money multiplier.
Targeting the Federal Funds Rate
In conducting monetary policy, the Fed has certain goals, or ultimate targets, such
as price stability and stable economic growth. In trying to reach these goals, the Fed
can use the monetary policy tools, or instruments, that we’ve discussed: reserve
requirements, the discount rate, the interest rate on reserves, and especially open-
market operations. The problem the Fed faces is how to use the instruments that it
controls directly, particularly open-market operations, to achieve its goals. Because
there are several steps between open-market operations and the ultimate behavior
of prices and economic activity—and because these steps often can’t be predicted
accurately—the Fed uses intermediate targets to guide monetary policy.
Intermediate targets, also sometimes called indicators, are macroeconomic vari-
ables that the Fed cannot control directly but can inﬂuence fairly predictably, and
that in turn are related to the goals the Fed is trying to achieve.
Historically, the most frequently used intermediate targets have been monetary
aggregates, such as M1 and M2, and short-term interest rates, such as the Fed
funds rate. By using open-market operations, the Fed can directly control the level
of the monetary base, which inﬂuences the monetary aggregates. Fluctuations in
the money supply in turn affect interest rates, at least temporarily, by causing the
LM curve to shift. Neither monetary aggregates nor short-term interest rates are
important determinants of economic welfare in and of themselves, but both inﬂu-
ence the state of the macroeconomy. Because monetary aggregates and short-term
interest rates are affected in a predictable way by the Fed’s policies and because
both in turn affect the economy, these variables qualify as intermediate targets.
At various times the Fed has guided monetary policy by attempting to keep
either monetary growth rates or short-term interest rates in or near preestablished
target ranges. Note that, although the Fed may be able to stabilize one or the other
of these variables, it cannot target both simultaneously. For example, suppose that
14
In the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, as the Fed began offering to pay interest on reserves, the Fed then offset
the reduction in the money supply caused by the fall in the money multiplier by increasing the monetary
base. As a result, the money supply did not decline. See “The Money Multiplier During Severe Financial
Crises,” pp. 533–537.

The Fed actually targets nominal interest rates. Over a short period of time, in which expected inﬂa-
tion is constant, targeting nominal interest rates and targeting real interest rates are the same.
the Fed were trying to target both the money supply and the Fed funds rate and
that the preestablished target ranges called for an increase in both variables. How
could the Fed meet these targets simultaneously? If it raised the monetary base to
raise the money supply, in the short run the increase in money supply would shift
the LM curve down and to the right, which would lower rather than raise the Fed
funds rate. Alternatively, if the Fed lowered the monetary base to try to increase the
Fed funds rate, the money supply would fall instead of rising, as required. Thus, in
general, the Fed cannot simultaneously meet targets for both interest rates and the
money supply, unless those targets are set to be consistent with each other.
In recent years the Fed has typically downplayed monetary aggregates and
focused on stabilizing the Fed funds rate at a target level. Figure 14.8 shows a sit-
uation in which this strategy is useful. When the LM curve is LM
1
, the economy is
at full-employment equilibrium at point E, with output at and a real interest rate
of r
1
. Suppose that most of the shocks hitting the economy are nominal shocks,
including shocks to money supply (perhaps because of changes in the money mul-
tiplier) and to money demand. Without intervention by the Fed, these nominal
shocks cause the LM curve to shift between LM
2
and LM
3
, leading aggregate
demand to shift erratically between Y
2
and Y
3
. In either the extended classical
model with misperceptions or the Keynesian model, random shifts in aggregate
demand cause undesirable cyclical ﬂuctuations in the economy.
The Fed could reduce the instability caused by nominal shocks by using mon-
etary policy to hold the real interest rate at r
1
.
15
In other words, whenever the LM
curve shifted up to LM

; similarly, shifts of the LM curve to LM

could be offset by reductions
in the money supply to return the LM curve to LM
1
. In this case stabilizing the
intermediate target, the interest rate, also would stabilize output at its full-
employment level. For interest rate targeting to be a good strategy, however,
nominal shocks must be the main source of instability.
When the Fed decided to target the Fed funds rate in the late 1980s, some
economists worried that the central bank was returning to a ﬂawed policy that con-
tributed to the large rise in inﬂation in the 1960s and 1970s. But Fed policymakers
argued that the policy ﬂaw was not the use of the Fed funds rate as an intermedi-
ate target per se, but the Fed’s failure to change its target for the Fed funds rate in
a timely matter.
Suppose, for example, that a shock hits the economy that shifts the IS curve to the
right; a sudden increase in foreign demand for exported goods is one possibility.
How should the Fed respond? Figure 14.9 illustrates this situation. In the graph,
suppose that before the shock, the economy is in general equilibrium at point E,
where the initial IS curve, IS
1
, intersects the initial LM curve, LM
1
, so the initial
equilibrium real interest rate is r
1
and the level of output is . The increase in
export demand causes the IS curve to shift up and to the right to IS
2
. If the Fed were
to keep the LM curve unchanged at LM
1
, then, as shown by point F, output would
rise to Y
2
and the real interest rate would rise to r
2
in the short run, and the price
level would rise in the long run. If the Fed were instead to maintain the real inter-
est rate at r
1
by increasing the money supply and shifting the LM curve to LM
2
,
then, as shown by point H, output would increase to Y
3
in the short run and the
price level would rise to restore equilibrium in the long run. The only way for the
Fed to maintain full employment and keep prices from rising is to increase the real
interest rate to r

by reducing the money supply and shifting the LM curve to LM

to attain short-run equilibrium at point J. To maintain full employment, as Fig. 14.9
shows, the Fed must shift the LM curve to the left by reducing the money supply
and increasing its target for the real interest rate, thus increasing its target for the
Fed funds rate (assuming no change in the expected inﬂation rate). Thus, when the
Fed targets the Fed funds rate, its target must change as shocks to the IS curve hit
the economy, if the Fed wants to keep the price level from changing.
In practice, how important are these shocks, and how much should the Fed
change its target for the Fed funds rate? Research suggests that the optimal value
of the target for the Fed funds rate varies substantially over time.
16
The challenge
for policymakers is that calculating the optimal Fed funds rate at any time is very
difﬁcult, as there is as much uncertainty about the optimal Fed funds rate as there
is about the full-employment level of output or the natural rate of unemployment,
as we discussed in Chapter 12, p. 458.
If the Fed targets the real interest rate, then it is useful to modify the LM curve.
Rather than having the LM slope upward as in our previous graphs, we could
instead directly show the Fed’s policy as represented by a horizontal line in the
IS-LM diagram (Fig. 14.10), which we will call the LR curve. In the graph, the
target real interest rate is denoted r
T
. The Fed uses open-market operations to hit
this target real interest rate on a day-to-day basis and allows the money supply to
change to whatever level is necessary to attain this target.
In setting monetary policy using the LR curve, the Fed now must think about
what real interest rate is desirable for the economy, rather than what nominal
money supply is needed. Consider the Fed’s response to a shock to the IS curve,

which we considered in Fig. 14.9. In that situation, we noted that the Fed should
modify its target for the real Federal funds rate to keep the economy at its full-
employment equilibrium without causing a change in the price level in the long
run. Thus the Fed must be ﬂexible in setting its real Federal funds rate target, r

,
constantly monitoring the economy to see if the IS curve might have shifted.
One advantage of targeting the real interest rate and using the LR curve is that
shocks to money demand are automatically offset. An increase in money demand
caused by some shock to the economy is automatically matched by an increase in
money supply, and the real interest rate remains unchanged.
Consider what would happen if the expected inﬂation rate, , increased. The
rise in would cause a decline in money demand, as we learned in Chapter 7 (see
Summary table 9 on page 255). Offsetting this shock by reducing money supply is
necessary for the Fed to keep the real interest rate unchanged. Of course, because
the nominal interest rate equals the real interest rate plus the expected inﬂation
rate, the rise in the expected inﬂation rate requires an increase in the nominal inter-
est rate. So, to follow this policy, the Fed must be careful to monitor the expected
inﬂation rate and to increase the nominal interest rate in response to a rise in the
expected inﬂation rate, thus maintaining its target for the real interest rate.
Making Monetary Policy in Practice
The IS–LM or AD–AS analysis of monetary policy suggests that using monetary
policy to affect output and prices is a relatively simple matter: All that the Fed
needs to do is change the money supply enough to shift the LM curve or the AD
curve to the desired point. In reality, however, making monetary policy is a com-
plex, ongoing process. Two important practical issues that policymakers have to
deal with are the lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy and uncer-
tainty about the channels through which monetary policy works.
Lags in the Effects of Monetary Policy. If changes in the money supply led to
immediate changes in output or prices, using monetary policy to stabilize the
economy would be relatively easy. The Fed would simply have to adjust its policy
instruments until the economy attained full employment with stable prices.
Unfortunately, most empirical evidence suggests that changes in monetary policy
take a fairly long time to affect the economy.
Some empirical estimates of how long it takes monetary policy to work are pre-
sented in Fig. 14.11, adapted from an article by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke and Mark Gertler
17
of New York University. Shown are the estimated
behaviors of three important variables during the ﬁrst forty-eight months after an
unanticipated tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. The variables shown are
the Fed funds rate (described in the preceding section), real GDP (a measure of
output), and the GDP deﬂator (a measure of the price level).

change, in percent; the right vertical axis measures the change in the federal funds
rate that occurs after the policy change, in percentage points.
Note that interest rates (here, the Fed funds rate) react quickly to monetary
policy changes. Following a tightening of monetary policy, the Fed funds rate rises
by more than 0.3 percentage point (for example, from 5.0% to 5.3%) within a month.
However, the effect of the policy change on interest rates is transitory; the Fed
funds rate starts falling quickly, and six to twelve months after the monetary policy
tightening it has nearly returned to its original value.
In contrast, output and (especially) the price level take much longer to respond
to the change in monetary policy. Real GDP barely responds to the policy change
during the ﬁrst four months or so. (Figure 14.11 actually shows a slight rise in GDP
during the ﬁrst two months, rather than the expected drop; this “wrong” response
probably reﬂects statistical uncertainty in the estimates rather than actual economic
behavior.) After about four months GDP begins to decline sharply, but the full effect
on output isn’t felt until sixteen to twenty months after the initial policy change.
The response of prices to the policy change is even slower than that of output.
The price level remains essentially unaffected for more than a year after the mon-
etary policy action! Only after this long delay does the tightening of monetary
policy cause prices to begin to fall.
The long lags in the operation of monetary policy make it very difﬁcult to use
this policy instrument with precision.

Because of these long lags, the FOMC can’t

Indeed, as we discuss shortly, a group of economists called monetarists has argued that these long
lags make monetary policy next to worthless as a tool for stabilizing the economy.

base its decisions on current levels of output and inﬂation alone. Instead, it must try
to forecast what the economy will be doing six months to two years in the future—
and make policy based on those forecasts. Because economic forecasts are often
inaccurate, monetary policymaking has sometimes been likened to trying to steer
a ship in a dense fog.
An illustration of the problems raised by the delayed effects of monetary policy
is a debate about how aggressive the Fed should be in its anti-inﬂationary policies.
The FOMC has on several occasions engaged in what were called preemptive strikes
on inﬂation, raising the Fed funds rate (that is, tightening monetary policy) even
though the current inﬂation rate was low. Critics of the Fed asked why tightening
monetary policy was necessary when inﬂation wasn’t currently a problem. The
FOMC responded that they weren’t reacting to current inﬂation but rather to fore-
casts of inﬂation a year or more into the future. They were correct in asserting
that, because of lags in monetary policy, trying to anticipate future inﬂation, rather
than reacting only to current inﬂation, is necessary. Because of the difﬁculties in
forecasting inﬂation, however, there was plenty of room for debate about how
tight monetary policy needed to be to prevent future inﬂation.
The Channels of Monetary Policy Transmission. Another practical difﬁculty
faced by monetary policymakers is determining exactly how monetary policy
affects the economy. So far we have identiﬁed two primary ways in which
monetary policy affects economic activity and prices.
First, according to the Keynesian IS–LM analysis (see Chapter 11), a reduction in
the money supply raises real interest rates, which in turn reduces aggregate demand
(spending by consumers and ﬁrms). Declining aggregate demand leads to falling
output and prices. The effects of monetary policy on the economy that work through
changes in real interest rates are called the interest rate channel of monetary policy .
Second, in open economies, a tightening of monetary policy raises the real
exchange rate (see Chapter 13). A higher real exchange rate, by making domestic
goods more expensive for foreigners and foreign goods cheaper for domestic resi-
dents, reduces the demand for the home country’s net exports. All else being equal,
this reduced demand for net exports also reduces aggregate demand, depressing
output and prices. The effects of monetary policy working through changes in the
real exchange rate are called the exchange rate channel.
According to some economists, a tightening of monetary policy also works by
reducing both the supply of and demand for credit, a mechanism referred to as
the credit channel of monetary policy. “In Touch with Data and Research: The
Credit Channel of Monetary Policy,” p.551, provides a brief description of this
potential channel.
Controversy swirls about the relative importance of these different channels of
monetary policy. That in turn increases the difﬁculty that policymakers have in
judging how “tight” or “easy” monetary policy is at any particular time. For exam-
ple, suppose that the Fed observes that real interest rates are currently high but that
the dollar has been falling. Is monetary policy tight or not? It’s hard to say, unless
we know the relative strengths of the interest rate channel and the exchange rate
channel. Similarly, suppose that the real interest rate is low (suggesting an easy
monetary policy) but that borrowing and lending have been unusually weak (sug-
gesting a tight monetary policy). Again, the signals are conﬂicting, and the judg-
ment about whether monetary policy is expansionary or contractionary depends
on the relative strength of the different channels.

Chapter 14 Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve System 551
IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The Credit Channel of Monetary Policy
According to some economists, besides working through interest rates and
exchange rates, monetary policy also affects credit supply and demand. These
effects are called the credit channel of monetary policy.*
On the supply side of the credit market, according to this theory, tight mone-
tary policy leads to reduced lending by banks. The reason is that, as we demon-
strated earlier in this chapter, a tightening of monetary policy reduces bank
reserves and thus the quantity of customer deposits that banks can accept. With
fewer deposits on hand, banks have a smaller quantity of funds available to lend.
As banks cut back on their lending, the argument goes, borrowers who depend on
banks for credit, such as consumers and small ﬁrms, are unable to obtain the credit
they need to make planned purchases. The resulting decline in spending depress-
es aggregate demand and thus economic activity.
On the demand side of the credit market, according to proponents of the
credit channel, tight monetary policy has the effect of making potential borrow-
ers less “credit-worthy,” or less eligible for loans. Consider for example a firm
that has a substantial amount of floating-rate debt, or debt whose interest rate is
tied to the current interest rate in the market. If a tightening of monetary policy
raises interest rates, the firm’s interest costs will rise, reducing its profitability.
The firm’s reduced profitability makes lending to the firm riskier (the firm is
more likely to go bankrupt), so the firm has trouble obtaining credit. Alterna-
tively, consider a consumer who wants to use some shares of stock that she
owns as collateral for a bank loan. Tighter monetary policy reduces the value of
those shares (as financial investors, lured by higher interest rates, switch from
stocks to bonds). With reduced collateral, the consumer will be able to borrow
less. In either example, the reduction in credit available to the borrower is likely
to lead to reduced spending and thus a weaker economy.
What is the evidence for the credit channel? On the supply side of the credit
market, many economists would argue that the credit channel was powerful
in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s but has been less so recently. The
reason for this weakening is that the deregulation of the banking sector and elim-
ination of reserve requirements for some types of large deposits have made it

In discussing the many problems of practical monetary policymaking, we do
not mean to suggest that good monetary policy is impossible. Indeed, U.S. mone-
tary policy in the quarter century preceding the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 produced
quite good results in that both inﬂation and unemployment were relatively low and
stable. However, this discussion does illustrate why making monetary policy may
be described as an art as well as a science.

552 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
easier for banks to maintain their lending, despite a reduction in bank reserves
caused by tight money. For example, today (unlike twenty years ago), a bank that
loses deposits can replace them by selling certiﬁcates of deposit (CDs) to corpo-
rations or wealthy individuals. A CD is a large ﬁxed-term debt obligation of the
bank, against which no reserves need to be held. As the bank doesn’t need to back
its CD issuances with reserves, a tightening of monetary policy doesn’t affect its
ability to raise funds in this way (except, perhaps, by raising the interest rate that
the bank must pay).
The evidence that monetary policy affects the demand side of the credit market
is stronger. For example, consumer and small ﬁrm spending is more sensitive to
monetary policy than spending by large ﬁrms.
†
A likely explanation of this ﬁnding
is that consumers and small ﬁrms are ﬁnancially riskier than large ﬁrms to begin
with, so when monetary policy tightens they are much more likely to ﬁnd them-
selves disqualiﬁed for loans. Bankruptcies do increase among small ﬁrms and
consumers following a tightening of monetary policy, and small ﬁrms and con-
sumers also receive less credit after monetary policy tightens, relative to that
received by large ﬁrms.

APPLICATION
The Financial Crisis of 2008
In the ﬁrst months of the housing crisis, (see “In Touch with Data and Research: The
Housing Crisis that Began in 2007,” pp. 249–250) many analysts thought that the
decline in house prices would lead to some losses at banks and other ﬁnancial insti-
tutions and might propel the economy into a recession (as it did), but no one foresaw
the sudden collapse of the ﬁnancial system that would occur in the fall of 2008.
In 2007, a number of ﬁnancial institutions that had invested heavily in mort-
gages and mortgage-backed securities ran into trouble and many went bankrupt.
But the problems of those institutions were not thought to pose a major threat to the
economy. The Fed kept its target for the nominal Federal funds rate unchanged
until September 2007, then lowered it gradually in following months. The Fed saw
the housing crisis as shifting the IS curve down and to the left because of the sub-
stantial reduction in residential construction, and this shift in the IS curve necessi-
tated a lower target for the real Federal funds rate.
As some banks began to worry about the viability of other ﬁnancial institutions,
such as investment banks, the banks made credit less readily available. To combat
the lack of credit availability , the Federal Reserve set up some new lending facilities
to keep credit ﬂowing in the economy. In December 2007, the Fed created a Term
Auction Facility to auction off loans to depository institutions to help fund banks
that would otherwise be unable to borrow from other banks. In March 2008, the Fed
used the same basic idea to allow ﬁrms to borrow against their bond holdings, by
creating the Term Securities Lending Facility . A similar institution, the Prime Dealer
M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:56 AM  Page 552
Chapter 14 Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve System 553
Credit Facility, was created to provide liquidity for investment banks. When the
huge investment bank Bear Stearns failed in March 2008, many investors feared that
the housing crisis could cause widespread damage.
All of these losses at ﬁnancial institutions did not seem to cause great harm to over-
all economic activity , however. A recession had begun in December 2007, but econom-
ic conditions were not very weak in early 2008 and the economy appeared to be gaining
strength in the summer of 2008. In fact, it appeared that the recession might be as mild
as the 1990–1991 recession or the 2001 recession and might end in the fall of 2008.
But the situation changed dramatically in September 2008. First, on September 7,
the huge mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into govern-
ment receivership because of their losses on mortgage-related assets. On September
15, the major investment bank Lehman Brothers ﬁled for bankruptcy, causing a
tremendous chain reaction in ﬁnancial markets because of all of the investments
other ﬁnancial institutions held in Lehman. Two days later, the Federal Reserve lent
$85 billion to giant insurance company AIG to keep it from going out of business and
defaulting on hundreds of billions of dollars in investments. Investors began to panic
in the United States and all over the world. Stock prices declined rapidly, and a full
scale ﬁnancial panic ensued.
To combat the panic, the Fed reduced interest rates quickly, which again was a
response to a further shift down and to the left of the IS curve. The Federal government
created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), with the goal of purchasing ﬁnancial
assets that were thought to be temporarily undervalued. This move was intended to
keep the ﬁnancial panic from causing sound ﬁrms to go under because of lack of
liquidity . The TARP funds were used in a variety of ways, especially to purchase equity
in banks, thus giving the banks the additional capital needed to prevent them from
going bankrupt. The FDIC also increased the limit for coverage on deposits from
$100,000 to $250,000 to keep large depositors from withdrawing their funds from banks.
The economy deteriorated rapidly in the face of the ﬁnancial crisis. Real GDP fell
2.7% (at an annual rate) in the third quarter of 2008, 5.4% in the fourth quarter, and
6.4% in the ﬁrst quarter of 2009. Overall, the length and severity of the recession
(through the second quarter of 2009) places it about on par with the recessions of
1973–1975 and 1981–1982. But without the lending programs that the Federal Reserve
and Federal government developed, the recession might have been far worse.
APPLICATION
The Zero Bound
The experience of Japan in the 1990s worried policymakers around the world. The Japan-
ese economy grew very slowly and GDP declined in some years. Japan found itself in a
liquidity trap, in which monetary policymakers were unable to reduce the nominal
interest rate to stimulate the economy because the interest rate was at its lower bound of
zero (the nominal interest rate cannot decline below zero because then it is more
proﬁtable for an investor to hold cash rather than to make a loan). Japan’s bad expe-
rience near the zero bound may have affected policymakers in other countries, including
the United States, who also saw inﬂation and interest rates declining to very low levels.

Japan’s experience near the zero bound occurred after the economy began to
slow in 1991. As Fig. 14.12 shows, the slowdown in the economy caused the
inﬂation rate to decline until it hit zero in early 1995, rebounded for a few years,
then became negative in 1999 and remained negative through 2005. A negative
inflation rate is a deflation (see Chapter 1, p. 6) and is associated historically
with very poor economic performance, such as during the Great Depression in
the United States.
Figure 14.12 also shows the overnight interest rate in Japan on uncollateralized
loans, similar to the Federal funds interest rate in the United States. The overnight
interest rate is a gauge of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy actions. To stimulate
the economy , the Bank of Japan reduced the overnight interest rate signiﬁcantly . The
rate fell from over 8% in 1990 to under 0.5% in 1995. Despite the dramatic reduction
in interest rates, the Japanese economy did not improve signiﬁcantly. As the 1990s
went on, the inﬂation rate and the expected inﬂation rate became negative. The
Bank of Japan had little room to reduce interest rates further. By 2001, the Bank of
Japan began measuring interest rates in thousandths of a percentage point. The
overnight interest rate averaged 0.002% per year in 2001, 2002, and 2004; 0.001% per
year in 2003; and 0.004% per year in 2005. Japan had clearly hit the zero bound. The
events in Japan caused U.S. monetary policymakers to consider what might happen
if the United States were to approach the zero bound. In a speech presented in both

20
outlined
three methods for dealing with the zero bound: (1) affecting interest rate expecta-
tions, (2) altering the composition of assets held by the central bank, and (3) expand-
ing the size of the central bank balance sheet. The ﬁrst method for dealing with the
zero bound is for the central bank to take action to change people’s expectations of
future interest rates. The main idea is that if people base their consumption and
investment decisions on long-term interest rates but the central bank can affect only
short-term interest rates, then the central bank may not have much impact on con-
sumption and investment. But if the central bank tells people that it expects to keep
short-term interest rates very low for a long time, then long-term interest rates may
decline relative to what they would be if people thought the central bank would
raise short-term interest rates in the near future. By announcing that it expects to
keep short-term interest rates very low, the central bank hopes to ﬂatten the yield
curve (see “In Touch with Data and Research: Interest Rates,” pp. 114–115), thus
lowering long-term interest rates.
Bernanke’s second method for dealing with the zero bound is to inﬂuence the
yield curve by having the Fed buy more long-term rather than short-term securities
in the open market. If the Fed were able to do so in large quantities, long-term inter-
est rates might decline, spurring an increase in consumption and investment. Such
a plan would need to be coordinated with the U.S. Treasury Department, as failure
to achieve such cooperation may have been a stumbling block the last time (1963)
the Fed tried this type of policy.
The third method a central bank could use is to increase the size of its balance
sheet, essentially printing new dollar bills and buying securities in the open market.
That is, rather than focusing on targeting the Federal funds rate, the Fed could
change its focus to the quantity of the monetary base or bank reserves, as it did in the
1979–1982 period. Japan used this method of “quantitative easing” in 2002–2003 to
prevent its deﬂation from worsening and to bring inﬂation back to near zero in 2004.
Overall, Bernanke argued, it is important for a central bank to take these steps to
affect the economy well before the public thinks that the central bank might be running
out of ammunition. Once the public becomes convinced that monetary policy is pow-
erless to help the economy, as may have been the case in Japan, affecting people’s
expectations becomes much more difﬁcult. A criticism of Japan’s policy is that it was
not nearly aggressive enough to head off deﬂation and stay away from the zero bound.
Of course, Bernanke had no idea when he discussed these methods that he would
be Fed chairman during the biggest ﬁnancial crisis since the Great Depression and
would need to employ all three methods on a grand scale. When the ﬁnancial crisis hit
in fall 2008, the Federal Reserve was concerned that the abrupt slowdown of the U.S.
economy would lead to a sharp decline in inﬂation and possibly even deﬂation. To
prevent that from happening, the Fed decided to use expansionary monetary policy,
cutting its target for the Federal funds interest rate to near zero, as Fig. 14.13 shows.

556 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
At the Fed’s meeting in December 2008, the Fed’s interest rate target was set at
“0 to percent,” so the Fed hit the lower bound. At that meeting, to implement
Bernanke’s ﬁrst method, the Fed announced that “weak economic conditions are
likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the Federal funds rate for some time,”
attempting to convince people that short-term interest rates would stay very low
and that long-term interest rates should also be low. At the same time, to implement
Bernanke’s second method, the Fed also announced that it was “evaluating the
potential beneﬁts of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities,” thus attempting to
inﬂuence the yield curve; in fact, the Fed began buying such long-term Treasury
securities in March 2009. Finally , the Fed used Bernanke’s third method by expand-
ing its balance sheet, developing new lending facilities and borrowing from the
U.S. Treasury Department to increase the money supply signiﬁcantly, even though
the Federal funds interest rate had hit the lower bound. The monetary base
increased from $843 billion in August 2008 to $1770 billion in May 2009.
All of these actions were not enough to fend off deﬂation completely, as the
inﬂation rate turned negative in early 2009, as Fig. 14.13 shows. However, the Fed
was not worried about a persistent deﬂation because much of the decline in prices
occurred in the energy sector, where prices dropped about 25% over the year, and
because forecasts for 2010 called for inflation to be low but positive. Thus, it
appears that Bernanke’s methods may have worked in practice, although it is too
early to tell whether after the economy stabilizes, the Fed will be able to success-
fully reverse course and prevent the large increase in the monetary base from gen-
erating higher inﬂation.

14.3 The Conduct of Monetary Policy: Rules Versus Discretion
How should monetary policy be used? On some aspects of this question, there is
broad agreement. Most classicals and Keynesians agree that money is neutral in
the long run so that changes in money growth affect inﬂation but not real variables
in the long run. Therefore most would accept that the main long-run goal of mon-
etary policy should be to maintain a low and stable inﬂation rate. However, there
is much less agreement about the effects of monetary policy and its appropriate
use in the short run (Chapters 10 and 11). Most Keynesians believe that monetary
policy can and should be used to smooth the business cycle, but most classicals
don’t. In this section we revisit the debate about the appropriate use of monetary
policy by addressing a long-standing question in macroeconomics: Should mon-
etary policy be conducted according to ﬁxed rules or at the discretion of the cen-
tral bank?
The use of rules in monetary policy has been advocated primarily by a
group of economists called monetarists, and also by classical macroecono-
mists. Supporters of rules believe that monetary policy should be essentially
automatic. In particular, in its control of the money supply, the central bank
should be required to follow a set of simple, prespecified, and publicly
announced rules. Many such rules can be imagined. For example, the Fed
might be instructed to increase the monetary base by 1% each quarter. An
alternative rule, which has been used historically, is to require the central bank
to conduct monetary policy to keep the price of gold at a predetermined level
(this rule was the essence of the gold standard). One might also imagine a
rule that permits the Fed to respond to the state of the economy, as we will dis-
cuss shortly.
Although the exact form of the rule chosen isn’t crucial, supporters of the rule-
based approach emphasize that the monetary rule should be simple; there can’t be
dozens of exceptions and conditions. Furthermore, the rule should be stated in
terms of variables that the Fed can control directly or nearly directly. Because the
Fed can control the monetary base precisely, a prespeciﬁed growth rate for the
monetary base is acceptable as a rule. But as the Fed’s control over, say, the nation-
al unemployment rate is indirect and imperfect, an instruction to the Fed to “keep
the unemployment rate at 4%” isn’t acceptable to advocates of a rule-guided mon-
etary policy.
The opposite of the rules approach, which has been supported by most (though
not all) Keynesian economists, is called discretion. The idea behind discretion is
that the central bank should be free to conduct monetary policy in any way that it
believes will advance the ultimate objectives of low and stable inﬂation, high eco-
nomic growth, and low unemployment. In particular, the central bank should con-
tinuously monitor the economy and, using the advice of economic experts, should
change the money supply as needed to best achieve its goals. Because a strategy of
discretion involves active responses by the central bank to changes in economic cir-
cumstances, such a strategy sometimes is called activist.
From this description of rules and discretion, you may have trouble under-
standing why many economists advocate the use of rules. After all, why should
anyone arbitrarily and unnecessarily tie the hands of the central bank? The idea
that giving the central bank the option of responding to changing economic con-
ditions as it sees ﬁt is always better than putting monetary policy in a straitjacket
dictated by rules is the essence of the Keynesian case for discretion.

Friedman’s 1959 book, A Program for Monetary Stability (New York: Fordham University Press) pre-
sents a clear early statement of his views.
558 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
This basic argument for discretion is attractive, but a strong case also may be
made for rules. Next we discuss the traditional monetarist argument for rules. We
then consider a relatively new argument for rules: that the use of rules increases the
credibility of the central bank.
The Monetarist Case for Rules
Monetarism emphasizes the importance of monetary factors in the macroeconomy.
Although monetarists have included numerous outstanding economists, the dom-
inant ﬁgure and leader of the group was Milton Friedman. For many years, Fried-
man argued that monetary policy should be conducted by rules, and this idea has
become an important part of monetarist doctrine.
21
Friedman’s argument for rules may be broken down into a series of propositions.
Proposition 1. Monetary policy has powerful short-run effects on the real economy. In
the longer run, however, changes in the money supply have their primary effect on the
price level.
Friedman’s research on U.S. monetary history (with Anna Schwartz) provided
some of the earliest and best evidence that changes in the money supply can be
nonneutral in the short run (Chapter 10). Friedman and other monetarists believe
that fluctuations in the money supply historically have been one of the most
signiﬁcant—if not the most signiﬁcant—sources of business cycle ﬂuctuations. On
long-run neutrality, Friedman (along with Edmund Phelps) was one of the ﬁrst to
argue that, because prices eventually adjust to changes in the money supply, the
effect of money on real variables can be only temporary (Chapter 12).
Proposition 2. Despite the powerful short-run effect of money on the economy, there is
little scope for using monetary policy actively to try to smooth business cycles.
Friedman backed this proposition with several points (several of which we dis-
cussed in connection with macroeconomic policy more generally in earlier chapters).
First, time is needed for the central bank and other agencies to gather and process
information about the current state of the economy. These information lags may
make it difﬁcult for the central bank to determine whether the economy actually is
in a recession and whether a change in policy is appropriate.
Second, there is considerable uncertainty about how much effect a change in
the money supply will have on the economy and how long the effect will take to
occur (see Fig. 14.11). Friedman has emphasized that there are long and variable lags
between monetary policy actions and their economic results. That is, not only
does monetary policy take a relatively long time to work, but the amount of time
it takes to work is unpredictable and can vary from episode to episode.
Third, wage and price adjustment, although not instantaneous, occurs rapidly
enough that, by the time the Fed recognizes that the economy is in a recession and
increases the money supply, the economy may already be heading out of the reces-
sion. If the expansion in the money supply stimulates the economy with a lag of
about a year, the stimulus may take effect when output has already recovered and the
economy is in a boom. In this case the monetary expansion will cause the economy
to overshoot full employment and cause prices to rise. Thus the monetary increase,
M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:57 AM  Page 558
intended to ﬁght the recession, may actually be destabilizing (causing more vari-
ability of output than there would have been otherwise), as well as inﬂationary.
Proposition 3. Even if there is some scope for using monetary policy to smooth business
cycles, the Fed cannot be relied on to do so effectively.
One reason that Friedman didn’t trust the Fed to manage an activist monetary
policy effectively was political. He believed that despite its supposed indepen-
dence, the Fed is susceptible to short-run political pressures from the President and
others in the administration. For example, the Fed might be pressured to stimulate
the economy during an election year. If timed reasonably well, an election-year
monetary expansion could expand output and employment just before voters go to
the polls, with the inﬂationary effects of the policy not being felt until after the
incumbents were safely reelected.
More fundamentally, though, Friedman’s distrust of the Fed arose from his
interpretation of macroeconomic history. From his work with Anna Schwartz,
Friedman concluded that for whatever reason—incompetence, shortsighted-
ness, or bad luck—monetary policy historically has been a greater source of
economic instability than stability. The primary example cited by Friedman is
the 1929–1933 period, when the Fed was unable or unwilling to stop the money
supply from falling by one-third in the wake of widespread runs on banks.
Friedman and Schwartz argued that this monetary contraction was one of the
main causes of the Great Depression. Thus Friedman concluded that eliminating
monetary policy as a source of instability would substantially improve macro-
economic performance.
How could the Fed be removed as a source of instability? This question led to
Friedman’s policy recommendation, the last proposition.
Proposition 4. The Fed should choose a speciﬁc monetary aggregate (such as M1 or
M2) and commit itself to making that aggregate grow at a ﬁxed percentage rate, year
in and year out.
For Friedman, the crucial step in eliminating the Fed as a source of instability
was to get it to give up activist, or discretionary, monetary policy and to commit
itself—publicly and in advance—to following some rule. Although the exact choice
of a rule isn’t critical, Friedman believed that a constant-money-growth rule would
be a good choice for two reasons. First, the Fed has considerable inﬂuence, though
not complete control, over the rate of money growth. Thus, if money growth devi-
ated signiﬁcantly from its target, the Fed couldn’t easily blame the deviation on
forces beyond its control. Second, Friedman argued that steady money growth
would lead to smaller cyclical ﬂuctuations than the supposedly “countercyclical”
monetary policies utilized historically. He concluded that a constant money growth
rate would provide a “stable monetary background” that would allow economic
growth to proceed without concern about monetary instability.
Friedman didn’t advocate a sudden shift from discretionary monetary policy to
a low, constant rate of money growth. Instead, he envisioned a transition period in
which the Fed, by gradual preannounced steps, would steadily reduce the growth
rate of money . Ultimately , the growth rate of the monetary aggregate selected would
be consistent with an inﬂation rate near zero. Importantly, after the constant growth
rate has been attained, the Fed wouldn’t respond to modest economic downturns by
increasing money growth but would continue to follow the policy of maintaining a
ﬁxed rate of money growth. However, in some of his writings Friedman appeared to

560 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
leave open the possibility that the monetary rule could be temporarily suspended in
the face of major economic crises, such as a depression.
Rules and Central Bank Credibility
Much of the monetarist argument for rules rests on pessimism about the compe-
tence or political reliability of the Federal Reserve. Economists who are more opti-
mistic about the ability of the government to intervene effectively in the economy
(which includes many Keynesians) question the monetarist case for rules. A “policy
optimist” could argue as follows:
Monetary policy may have performed badly in the past. However, as time passes, we
learn more about the economy and the use of policy gets better. For example, U.S.
monetary policy clearly was handled better after World War II than during the Great
Depression. Imposing rigid rules just as we are beginning to learn how to use activist
policy properly would be foolish. As to the issue of political reliability, that problem
affects ﬁscal policymakers and indeed all our branches of government. We just have to
trust in the democratic process to ensure that policymakers will take actions that for
the most part are in the best interests of the country.
For policy optimists this reply to the monetarist case for rules seems perfectly
satisfactory. During the past three decades, however, a new argument for rules has
been developed that applies even if the central bank knows exactly how monetary
changes affect the economy and is completely public-spirited. Thus the new argu-
ment for rules is a challenge even to policy optimists. It holds that the use of mon-
etary rules can improve the credibility of the central bank, or the degree to which
the public believes central bank announcements about future policy, and that the
credibility of the central bank inﬂuences how well monetary policy works.
One reason that the central bank’s credibility matters is that people’s expecta-
tions of the central bank’s actions affects their behavior. For example, suppose that
the central bank announces that it intends to maintain a stable price level by main-
taining a stable money supply. If ﬁrms increase prices and the aggregate price level
increases, the real money supply will fall, causing the LM curve to shift up and to the
left. As a result output and employment will fall. If ﬁrms collectively believe the Fed
will try to ﬁght the drop in output and employment by increasing the nominal
money supply—contrary to its stated intentions to maintain a stable money
supply—they will go ahead and raise prices. However, if ﬁrms collectively believe
that the central bank will abide by its stated intention to maintain a stable money
supply, they will not increase their prices because they realize that the central bank
will allow the drop in output and employment to occur and the ﬁrms will have to
reduce prices in the future anyway. Thus, if the central bank’s statement that it
intends to maintain stable prices and money is credible, ﬁrms won’t raise prices;
however, if the central bank’s statement lacks credibility, prices will rise.
Rules, Commitment, and Credibility. We have seen why central bank credibility is
important. If a central bank is credible, it can maintain stable prices even if business
ﬁrms threaten to raise prices. But how can a central bank achieve credibility?
One possibility is for the central bank to develop a reputation for carrying out
its promises. Suppose that in the preceding example ﬁrms raise their prices, fully
expecting the Fed to increase the money supply. However, the Fed holds the money
supply constant, causing a recession. The next time, the ﬁrms may take the Fed’s
promises more seriously.
M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:57 AM  Page 560
Chapter 14 Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve System 561
The problem with this strategy is that it may involve serious costs while the
reputation is being established: The economy suffers a recession while the central
bank establishes its reputation. Is there some less costly way to achieve credibility?
Advocates of rules suggest that, by forcing the central bank to keep its promises,
rules may substitute for reputation in establishing credibility . Suppose that there is an
ironclad rule—ideally, enforced by some outside agency—that the Fed must gradu-
ally reduce the growth of the money supply . Observing the existence of this rule, the
ﬁrms might well believe that money supply growth is going to be steady no matter
what, and price stability can be achieved. Note that if it increases credibility, a rule
improves central bank performance even if the central bank is competent and public-
spirited. Hence this reason for monetary policy rules is different from the mone-
tarists’ argument presented earlier.
How do advocates of discretion respond to the credibility argument for rules?
Keynesians argue that there may be a trade-off between credibility and ﬂexibility . For
a rule to establish credibility , it must be virtually impossible to change—otherwise, no
one will believe that the Fed will stick to it. In the extreme, the monetary growth rule
would be added as an amendment to the Constitution, which could then be changed
only at great cost and with long delays. But if a rule is completely unbreakable, what
happens (ask the Keynesians) if some unexpected crisis arises—for example, a new
depression? In that case the inability of the Fed to take corrective action—that is, its
lack of ﬂexibility—could prove disastrous. Therefore, Keynesians argue, establishing
a rule ironclad enough to create credibility for the central bank would, by eliminat-
ing policy ﬂexibility, also create unacceptable risks.
The Taylor Rule
Advocates of the use of rules in monetary policy believe that the Fed should be
required to follow a set of simple, prespeciﬁed, and publicly announced rules
when setting policy instruments. Nothing in the concept of rules, however, neces-
sarily prohibits the Fed from responding to the state of the economy, as long as
those responses are built into the rule itself. An example of a monetary policy rule
that allows the Fed to take economic conditions into account is the so-called Taylor
rule, introduced by John Taylor
22
of Stanford University. The Taylor rule is given by
(14.6)
where
The Taylor rule requires that the real Fed funds rate, i – π, respond to (1) the dif-
ference between output and full-employment output and (2) the difference
between inﬂation and its target, here taken to be 2%, or 0.02. The Taylor rule ﬁts in
with the idea we discussed in section 14.2 that many central banks target the real
 of output from full-employment output
y = (Y - Y)/Y = the percentage deviation 
p = the rate of inflation over the previous four quarters;
i = the nominal Fed funds rate (the Fed
œ
s intermediate target);
i = p + 0.02 + 0.5y + 0.5(p - 0.02),

562 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
interest rate, rather than the real money supply, as an intermediate target. Notice
that if output is at its full-employment level and inﬂation is at its 2% target, the
Taylor rule has the Fed setting the real funds rate at 2%, which is approximately its
long-run average level. If the economy is “overheating,” with output above its
full-employment level and inﬂation above its target, the Taylor rule would have the
Fed tighten monetary policy by raising the real Fed funds rate above 2%. Con-
versely, if the economy shows weakness, with output below its full-employment
level and inﬂation below its target, the Taylor rule indicates that the real Fed funds
rate should be reduced below 2%, thereby easing monetary policy. Both responses
are consistent with standard Fed practice. Indeed, Taylor showed that, historically,
his relatively simple rule describes actual Fed behavior quite accurately.
Unlike some advocates of rules, Taylor has not argued that the Fed follow his
rule slavishly and mechanically. Rather, he would have his rule serve as a guideline
for monetary policy. Deviations from the rule would be permitted when, in the
judgment of the policymakers, special circumstances prevailed. Nevertheless, for
the idea of a policy rule to have meaning, the Fed would have to commit to fol-
lowing the rule (or staying very close to it) the great majority of the time.
Since Taylor ﬁrst wrote about the rule in 1993, economists all over the world
have studied its properties, and it has become common to assume that a central
bank follows some type of rule that is similar to the Taylor rule. In practice, econ-
omists at central banks often show what policy should be used to follow the
Taylor rule and then make an argument for why they might want to deviate
from the rule.
Figure 14.14 illustrates the actual Federal funds rate over time and what the
Federal funds rate would have been if the original Taylor rule had been followed.
23
The Fed set the Federal funds rate well below the level suggested by the Taylor rule
in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. In that period, the inﬂation rate rose
from about 1% in 1963 to over 10% by 1975, averaging 2.5% in the 1960s and 6.7%
in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the Fed set the Federal funds rate above the level sug-
gested by the Taylor rule, causing inﬂation to decline from 10% in 1981 to 3.5% in
1989; it averaged 4.5% over the decade. In the 1990s, the Federal funds rate was set
fairly close to that suggested by the rule, and the inﬂation rate was fairly stable,
averaging 2.2%. In the 2000s, the Federal funds rate has mainly been lower than the
level suggested by the Taylor rule, though the inﬂation rate has maintained its
average of 2.2%.
For the past 50 years, the Taylor rule seems to have performed about as expected.
When the Fed has set the Federal funds rate below the level suggested by the Taylor
rule, inﬂation has often risen, and vice versa. One exception has been in the 2000s,
when inﬂation did not rise, even though the Fed seems to have set the Federal funds
rate below the level suggested by the Taylor rule for most of the decade. Clearly , in the
ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, with a potentially catastrophic breakdown in credit markets,
the Fed could justify its actions. But even in the early 2000s, when the economy was
in a recession followed by a period of slow growth, the Fed indicated concerns about
the possibility of deﬂation (see the Application “The Zero Bound,” pp. 553–556), which
justiﬁed keeping the Federal funds rate below the level suggested by the Taylor rule.
23
The line marked “Taylor rule” in Figure 14.14 is based on the data available today and not exactly
what the Fed would have done in real time if it followed the Taylor rule because of data revisions and
the fact that today we know more about what the level of full-employment output was in the past.

Chapter 14 Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve System 563
The Taylor rule in Eq. (14.6) has been the subject of extensive research in the
past 15 years. Economists have discovered that the rule may work better if formu-
lated in terms of forecasts for the future values of inﬂation and the deviation of
output from full-employment output, rather than looking at past inﬂation and the
current level of output relative to full-employment output. Economists have also
experimented with different coefﬁcients on the terms of the rule (alternatives to
Taylor’s initial 0.5 coefﬁcients on the output term and the inﬂation term) and exam-
ined targets other than 2% inﬂation. For central banks all over the world, the Taylor
rule has become a focal point of policy discussions.
Other Ways to Achieve Central Bank Credibility
Besides announcing targets for money growth or inﬂation, are there other ways to
increase the central bank’s credibility and thus improve the performance of mone-
tary policy? Three possibilities have been suggested: to appoint a “tough” central
banker; to change central bankers’ incentives; and to increase the central bank’s
independence.
1. Appointing a “tough” central banker. By deﬁnition, a credible central bank is one
that will be believed by the public when the bank, usually through its chair-
man, states its intention to reduce money growth and inﬂation. One way to
increase credibility is for the President to appoint a Fed chairman who
strongly dislikes inﬂation and who people believe is willing to accept in-
creased unemployment if necessary to bring inﬂation down. Thus, when

President Jimmy Carter faced a serious inﬂation problem in 1979, he
appointed Paul Volcker—an imposing individual with a strong anti-inﬂation
reputation—to be chairman of the Fed. In appointing a “tough” central
banker, Carter hoped to convince the ﬁnancial markets and the public that he
was serious about reducing inﬂation. Volcker succeeded in getting rid of
inﬂation, but, because unemployment rose signiﬁcantly in the process, his ap-
pointment didn’t completely solve the credibility problem.
24
2. Changing central bankers’ incentives. A second way to enhance the central bank’s
credibility is to give its leadership strong incentives to be “tough” on inﬂation (and
to ignore any unemployment costs associated with disinﬂation).
25
If the incentives
are strong enough and are publicly known, people may ﬁnd the central bank’s
anti-inﬂation pronouncements to be credible. An interesting recent example of
this approach, mentioned in the Application, “Inﬂation Targeting,” is the law
passed in New Zealand that sets explicit inﬂation targets for the central bank and
provides for the replacement of the head of the central bank if those targets aren’t
met. Inﬂation came down signiﬁcantly in New Zealand, but unemployment rose.
Again, credibility problems were not completely solved.
3. Increasing central bank independence. A third strategy is to increase the indepen-
dence of the central bank from the other parts of the government—for example,
by limiting the legal ability of the executive and legislative branches to interfere
in monetary policy decisions. The rationale is that a more independent central
bank will be less subject to short-term political pressures to try to expand out-
put and employment (say, before an election) and will be more strongly com-
mitted to maintaining a low long-run inﬂation rate. Because the public will rec-
ognize that an independent central bank is less subject to political pressures,
announcements made by the central bank should be more credible.
Considerable evidence supports the idea that independent central banks are
more credible. Figure 14.15, taken from a study by Alberto Alesina and
Lawrence. Summers of Harvard University,
26
showed the relationship between
central bank independence and inflation in sixteen industrialized countries for
the period 1955–1988. The vertical axis measures average inflation for each
country. The horizontal axis shows an index of central bank independence
(based on factors such as the ease with which the government can dismiss the
head of the central bank or reverse central bank decisions). Countries with rel-
atively independent central banks, such as Germany, Switzerland, and the
United States, clearly had lower long-run inflation rates than countries without
independent central banks, such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand,
27
Italy,
24
The point that appointing a tough central banker may improve central bank credibility was made
by Kenneth Rogoff, “The Optimal Degree of Commitment to an Intermediate Monetary Target,”
Quarterly Journal of Economics, November 1985, pp. 1169–1189. Keynesians might argue that Volcker
was credible but that long-lived stickiness in wages and prices led unemployment to increase in
1981–1982 anyway.

and Spain. A similar figure in the Alesina–Summers study shows that countries
with independent central banks don’t have higher long-run rates of
unemployment. This evidence supports the idea that increased central bank
independence raises credibility and thus lowers the unemployment cost of
keeping inflation low.

APPLICATION
Inflation Targeting
Since 1989, many central banks have adopted inﬂation targeting as a strategy for
conducting monetary policy.
28
Typically, this strategy requires the central bank to
announce a target range for the inﬂation rate. Because the inﬂation targets are pub-
licly announced, the public can easily observe whether a central bank consistently
achieves its goals, and a consistently successful central bank is likely to develop
valuable credibility.
28
For discussions and historical analyses of inﬂation targeting, see Ben S. Bernanke, Thomas Laubach,
Frederic S. Mishkin, and Adam S. Posen, Inﬂation Targeting: Lessons from the International Experience
(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1999); and Bernanke and Mishkin, “Inﬂation Targeting: A
New Strategy for Monetary Policy?” Journal of Economic Perspectives, Spring 1997.

566 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
The pioneer of inflation targeting was New Zealand, which, as part of a
package of economic reforms, announced a set of inflation targets that the
Reserve Bank (the central bank of New Zealand) would have to meet. Under the
law passed by New Zealand, if the Reserve Bank failed to meet its inflation tar-
gets, the governor of the bank (analogous to the chairman of the Federal
Reserve) could be fired. Numerous other countries have adopted inflation tar-
geting in recent years, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Aus-
tralia, Israel, Brazil, and Spain. In the United States, the Fed has increased its
emphasis on maintaining low and stable inflation, but hasn’t officially adopted
a strategy of inflation targeting. The European Central Bank uses a modified
inflation-targeting approach.
When using a strategy of inﬂation targeting, as the name implies, the central
bank (usually together with the executive branch of the government) announces the
inﬂation rate that it will try to achieve over the subsequent one to four years. Thus,
rather than targeting an intermediate variable (money growth), the central bank tar-
gets one of its ultimate goals, the rate of inﬂation. A strategy of inﬂation targeting
doesn’t preclude the use of monetary policy to help stabilize output or other macro-
economic variables in the short run. However, by announcing an inﬂation target,
the central bank signals that hitting that target in the longer run is its number-one
priority.
29
A major disadvantage of inflation targeting is that inflation responds to
policy actions only with a long lag (see Fig. 14.11). As a result, the central bank
can’t easily judge which policy actions are needed to hit the inflation target,
and the public can’t easily determine whether the central bank is living up to its
promises. Thus inflation-targeting central banks may sometimes badly 
miss their targets, losing credibility as a result. Whether inflation targeting 
will be the preferred strategy for monetary policy in the future remains to 
be seen.
Before becoming Fed chairman in 2006, Ben Bernanke publicly supported
inﬂation targeting as a desirable strategy for the Fed, leading many economists to
believe that he eventually would get the FOMC to follow some type of inﬂation-
targeting system. From reading the minutes of the Fed’s meetings since then, we
know that the Fed discussed many issues related to inﬂation targeting but even-
tually decided not to target inﬂation explicitly. Nonetheless, the Fed has come to
adopt a number of procedures that many inﬂation-targeting countries use, includ-
ing providing an increased number of forecasts to the public and explaining
those forecasts in greater detail than before. In addition, the Fed’s policymakers
now publicly announce their long-run forecasts for several different variables,
and analysts could view their long-run forecast for inflation as an implicit
inﬂation target.
29
Inﬂation targeting does not qualify as a policy rule in the strict sense advocated by Friedman, for
two reasons. First, it involves targeting a goal variable (inﬂation) rather than an instrument of
policy, such as an interest rate or a monetary aggregate. Second, this approach allows the central
bank to exercise some discretion in the short run, as long as it meets the inﬂation target in the
longer run. Advocates of inﬂation targeting hope that this approach will combine the credibility
beneﬁts of a strict rule with the advantage of having some degree of policy discretion. Bernanke
and Mishkin, in their article cited in footnote 28, refer to inﬂation targeting as a strategy of “con-

Chapter 14 Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve System 567
CHAPTER SUMMARY
1. Three groups help determine the money supply: the
central bank, private-sector banks, and the general
public. The central bank sets the monetary base, which is
the quantity of central bank liabilities that can be used as
money. The monetary base equals the sum of bank
reserves (deposits by banks at the central bank plus cur-
rency in the vaults of banks) and currency held by the
nonbank public. Private-sector banks and the general
public interact to determine the money multiplier, which
is the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base.
2. The money multiplier equals (cu + 1)/(cu + res), where
cu is the public’s desired ratio of currency to deposits
and res is the ratio of reserves to deposits desired by
banks. The money supply equals deposits plus cur-
rency held by the nonbank public and also equals the
money multiplier times the monetary base. An
increase in the desired currency–deposit ratio, cu, or in
the desired reserve–deposit ratio, res, reduces the
money multiplier. During the Great Depression in the
United States, banking panics caused both cu and res
to increase, and the money multiplier and the money
supply both fell sharply , whereas in the ﬁnancial crisis
of 2008, the money multiplier also fell sharply but the
Federal Reserve increased the monetary base so much
that the money supply did not decline.
3. The central bank can affect the size of the monetary
base and thus the money supply through open-
market operations. An open-market sale (in which
central bank assets are sold for currency or bank
reserves) reduces the monetary base. An open-
market purchase (in which the central bank uses
money to buy assets, such as government securities,
from the public) increases the monetary base.
4. The central bank of the United States is called the
Federal Reserve System, or the Fed. The leadership of
the Fed is the Board of Governors, which in turn is
headed by the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets
about eight times each year to set monetary policy.
5. The Fed affects the U.S. money supply primarily
through open-market operations. Discount window
lending and changes in reserve requirements can also be
used to affect the money supply . An increase in discount
window lending raises the monetary base and thus the
money supply. An increase in reserve requirements
raises the reserve–deposit ratio, lowering the money
multiplier and the money supply. An increase in the
interest rate on reserves raises the reserve-deposit ratio,
lowering the money multiplier and the money supply.
6. The Fed uses intermediate targets such as the money
supply or short-term interest rates (primarily the Fed
funds rate) to guide monetary policy. Stabilizing
interest rates is a useful strategy when ﬂuctuations in
money supply or demand would otherwise cause the
LM curve to shift randomly back and forth.
7. The Federal Reserve and many other central banks
choose to target interest rates in setting policy. This
method can be analyzed either in the traditional IS-
LM model, or in a modiﬁed model with a horizontal
LR curve replacing the LM curve.
8. The channels through which monetary policy has its
effects include the interest rate channel, the exchange
rate channel, and the credit channel. Proponents of
the credit channel argue that monetary policy works
in part by affecting the supply of credit (the quantity
of funds that banks can lend) and the demand for
credit (which reﬂects the ability of potential borrow-
ers to qualify for loans).
9. Monetary policy may be conducted either by rules or
by discretion. Under rules, the central bank is required
to follow a simple predetermined rule for monetary
policy, such as a requirement for constant money
growth. Under discretion, the central bank is expected
to monitor the economy and use monetary policy
actively to maintain full employment and to keep inﬂa-
tion low. Discretion for monetary policy is usually
favored by Keynesians, who argue that it gives the Fed
maximum ﬂexibility to stabilize the economy.
10. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, argue that,
because of information problems and lags between
the implementation of policy changes and their
effects, the scope for using monetary policy to stabi-
lize the economy is small. Furthermore, they argue,
the Fed cannot be relied on to use active monetary
policy wisely and in the public interest. Monetarists
advocate a constant-growth-rate rule for the money
supply to discipline the Fed and keep monetary ﬂuc-
tuations from destabilizing the economy.
11. An additional argument for rules is that they increase
central bank credibility. Supporters of rules claim that
the use of ironclad rules will cause the public to
believe the central bank if it says (for example) that
money supply growth will be reduced, with the
implication that inﬂation can be reduced without a
large increase in unemployment.
12. The Taylor rule suggests that a central bank targets
interest rates based on the deviation of inﬂation from
its target and the deviation of output from its full-
employment level.
13. Inﬂation targeting has been adopted by a number of
countries. This approach allows the central bank some
discretion in the short run but commits the bank to
M14_ABEL4529_07_SE_C14.QXD  12/18/09  12:57 AM  Page 567
568 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
achieving a preannounced target for inﬂation in the
longer run.
14. Possible alternatives for increasing a central bank’s
credibility are to appoint a central banker who is
“tough” on inflation; to increase central bankers’
incentives to reduce inﬂation; and to increase the cen-
tral bank’s independence from other parts of the
government.

REVIEW QUESTIONS
All review questions are available in
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. Deﬁne monetary base. How does the monetary base differ
from the money supply?
2. Deﬁne money multiplier. Discuss how actions of the
public and banks can cause the money multiplier to
rise or fall. Does the fact that the public and banks can
affect the money multiplier imply that the central bank
cannot control the money supply? Why or why not?
3. What is the effect on the monetary base of an open-
market purchase of U.S. Treasury securities? What is the
effect on the money supply?
4. Who determines monetary policy in the United States?
What role does the President play?

NUMERICAL PROBLEMS
All numerical problems are available in 
at www.myeconlab.com.
1. The monetary base is $1,000,000. The public always
holds half its money supply as currency and half as
deposits. Banks hold 20% of deposits in the form of
reserves. Starting with the initial creation of a monetary
base that accompanies the purchase by the central bank
of $1,000,000 worth of securities from the public, show
the consolidated balance sheet of the banks after they
ﬁrst receive deposits, after a ﬁrst round of loans and
redeposits, and after a second round of loans and rede-
posits. (Hint: Don’t forget that the public keeps only half
its money in the form of bank deposits.)
Show the balance sheets of the central bank, the
banking system, and the public at the end of the
process of multiple expansion of loans and deposits.
What is the ﬁnal value of the money supply?
2. a. The money supply is $6,000,000, currency held by the
public is $2,000,000, and the reserve–deposit ratio is
0.25. Find deposits, bank reserves, the monetary
base, and the money multiplier.
b. In a different economy, vault cash is $1,000,000,
deposits by depository institutions at the central bank
are $4,000,000, the monetary base is $10,000,000, and
bank deposits are $20,000,000. Find bank reserves, the
money supply, and the money multiplier.
3. When the real interest rate increases, banks have an
incentive to lend a greater portion of their deposits,
which reduces the reserve–deposit ratio. In particular,
suppose that
where res is the reserve–deposit ratio and r is the real
interest rate. The currency–deposit ratio is 0.4, the price
res = 0.4 - 2r,
level is ﬁxed at 1.0, and the monetary base is 60. The real
quantity of money demanded is
where Y is real output and i is the nominal interest rate.
Assume that expected inﬂation is zero so that the nomi-
nal interest rate and the real interest rate are equal.
a. If r = i = 0.10, what are the reserve–deposit ratio,
the money multiplier, and the money supply? For
what real output, Y, does a real interest rate of 0.10
clear the asset market?
b. Repeat Part (a) for r = i = 0.05.
c. Suppose that the reserve–deposit ratio is ﬁxed at
the value you found in Part (a) and isn’t affected by
interest rates. If r = i = 0.05, for what output, Y,
does the asset market clear in this case?
d. Is the LM curve ﬂatter or steeper when the reserve–
deposit ratio depends on the real interest rate than
when the reserve–deposit ratio is ﬁxed? Explain
your answer in economic terms.
4. Suppose the current price level is 149.2 and one year ago
the price level was 147.3. Output is currently 12,892.5
and potential output is 13,534.2 (both in billions of 2005
dollars).
a. What value of the Federal funds rate would the Fed
choose if it follows the Taylor rule given by Eq. (14.6)?
b. Suppose that one year later, the price level has
declined by 0.4%, output has declined by 1.3%, and
potential output has increased 3%. In this new sit-
uation, what value of the Federal funds rate would
the Fed choose if it follows the Taylor rule? What is
the problem with setting the Federal funds rate to
follow the Taylor rule in this case?
L(Y, i) = 0.5Y - 10i,
5. Besides open-market operations, what other means does
the Federal Reserve have for controlling the money
supply? Explain how these alternative methods work.
6. What are intermediate targets? How do they differ from
monetary policy goals? Describe how the Fed can target
the real interest rate and how the LR curve can replace
the LM curve in the IS–LM diagram.
7. What are the three channels of monetary policy? Explain
each channel brieﬂy.
8. “It is plain to see that discretion is a better way to run
monetary policy than following a rule because a
policy of discretion gives the central bank the ability to
react to news about the economy.” What is the mone-
tarist response to this statement? What is the more
recent argument for using rules rather than discretion?
9. Describe the Taylor rule. What are the variables that
determine the recommended interest rate according
to the rule? How has the rule performed historically?
10. How does the use of inﬂation targeting improve central
bank credibility? What is the main disadvantage of inﬂa-
tion targeting?

ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS
1. How would each of the following affect the U.S. money
supply? Explain.
a. Banks decide to hold more excess reserves. (Excess
reserves are reserves over and above what banks
are legally required to hold against deposits.)
b. People withdraw cash from their bank accounts for
Christmas shopping.
c. The Federal Reserve sells gold to the public.
d. The Federal Reserve reduces the interest rate it
pays on deposits of depository institutions held at
the Fed.
e. A ﬁnancial crisis leads people to sell many of their
stocks and deposit the proceeds in bank accounts,
which are federally insured.
f. The Federal government sells $20 billion of new gov-
ernment bonds to the Federal Reserve. The proceeds
of the sale are used to pay government employees.
g. The Federal Reserve sells some of its government
securities in Tokyo for yen.
2. Suppose that the Fed were committed to following the
Taylor rule, in Eq. (14.6). For each of the following types
of shocks, determine whether the use of the Taylor rule
would tend to be stabilizing or destabilizing, or would
have an ambiguous effect, relative to a policy of leaving
the money supply unchanged. Consider the behavior of
both output and inﬂation.
a. An increase in money demand.
b. A temporary increase in government purchases.
c. An adverse supply shock.
d. A decline in consumer conﬁdence.
e. An increase in export demand.
3. Use the LR curve to show the impact of each of the fol-
lowing shocks on the economy in the short run and the
long run, following the Keynesian model. Draw a dia-
gram to answer each question.
a. An increased investment tax credit designed to
stimulate investment is put into place, and the Fed
does not change its target for the real interest rate.
b. An increased investment tax credit designed to
stimulate investment is put into place, and the Fed
changes its target for the real interest rate to keep
output from changing in the short run.
c. The expected inﬂation rate increases, and the Fed
keeps its target for the nominal interest rate
unchanged.
d. The expected inﬂation rate increases, and the Fed
keeps its target for the real interest rate unchanged.
4. Why do many governments have policies against nego-
tiating with hostage-taking terrorists? Under what con-
ditions, if any, are such policies likely to reduce hostage
taking? Discuss the analogy to monetary rules.
WORKING WITH MACROECONOMIC DATA
For data to use in these exercises, go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis FRED database at research.stlouisfed.org/fred2.
1. Obtain data on currency held by the nonbank
public, which is called the currency component of
M1 (starting in 1959). Define “deposits” for each
year since 1959 to be M2 minus currency, and
define “reserves” to be the monetary base minus
currency.
Calculate and graph the M2 money multiplier, the
reserve–deposit ratio, and the currency–deposit ratio
for the period since 1959. What is the trend in the
money multiplier? How is this trend related to the
trends in the reserve–deposit and currency–deposit
ratios? Do you have any hypotheses about what fac-
tors underlie these trends?
2. During much of the postwar period, the Fed attempt-
ed to stabilize nominal interest rates. However, during
1979–1982 the Fed under Paul Volcker greatly reduced
its emphasis on interest rate stabilization to focus on
ﬁghting inﬂation.
Calculate and graph the quarter-to-quarter change
in the three-month Treasury bill rate since 1961. What
happened to the volatility of interest rates in the
1979–1982 period? What has happened to the volatility
of interest rates since 1982? Does your answer change if
your measure of the interest rate is the ten-year
government bond rate?
3. As discussed in the text, if money demand is unstable,
the Fed may prefer to target interest rates rather than the
money supply itself. When the Fed follows an interest-
rate-targeting policy, “Fed watchers” in ﬁnancial mar-
kets and the media typically look to changes in
short-term interest rates rather than changes in the
money supply to gauge the Fed’s intentions.
Graph the three-month Treasury bill interest rate and
the unemployment rate, using monthly data since 1961.
If changes in monetary policy are reﬂected primarily by
changes in the short-term interest rate, what relationship
would you expect to see between these two variables?
Does this relationship hold up in the data?

CHAPTER 15
Government Spending 
and its Financing
At every level of government, from the town hall to the White House, fiscal
policy—government decisions about how much to spend, what to spend for, and
how to ﬁnance its spending—is of central importance. Politicians and the public
understand that the government’s ﬁscal choices have a direct impact on the “bread
and butter” issues of how much they pay in taxes and what government beneﬁts
and services they receive. Equally important are the effects of ﬁscal policy on the
economy. In recent years, people have become more aware of the macroeconomic
effects of ﬁscal policy as the economic implications of government budget deﬁcits
and surpluses, tax reform, Social Security reform, government bailouts, and other
aspects of ﬁscal policy have been extensively debated.
In this chapter we take a close look at ﬁscal policy and its macroeconomic
effects. To provide some background, we begin with deﬁnitions and facts about the
government’s budget. We then discuss some basic ﬁscal policy issues, including the
effects of government spending and taxes on economic activity, the burden of gov-
ernment debt, and the link between budget deﬁcits and inﬂation.
15.1 The Government Budget: Some Facts and Figures
Before getting into the analytical issues of ﬁscal policy, we set the stage by looking
at the components of the government budget and their recent trends. We discuss
three main aspects of the budget: (1) spending, or outlays; (2) tax revenues, or
receipts; and (3) the budget surplus or deﬁcit. Our discussion reviews and builds
on Chapter 2, in which we introduced basic budget concepts.
Government Outlays
Government outlays, the total spending by the government during a period of
time, are classiﬁed into three primary categories: government purchases, transfer
payments, and net interest payments.
1. Government purchases (G) are government expenditures on currently produced
goods and services, including capital goods. Government spending on capital
goods, or government investment, accounts for about one-sixth of government
purchases of goods and services. The remaining ﬁve-sixths of government
purchases are government consumption expenditures.
M15_ABEL4529_07_SE_C15.QXD  12/18/09  1:03 AM  Page 571
572 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
2. Transfer payments (TR) are payments made to individuals for which the gov-
ernment does not receive current goods or services in exchange. Examples of
transfers are Social Security beneﬁt payments, military and civil service pen-
sions, unemployment insurance, welfare payments (Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families), and Medicare.
1
3. Net interest payments (INT) are the interest paid to the holders of government
bonds less the interest received by the government—for example, on out-
standing government loans to students or farmers.
In addition there is a minor category called subsidies less surpluses of government
enterprises. Subsidies are government payments that are intended to affect the pro-
duction or prices of various goods. Examples are price support payments to farmers
and fare subsidies for mass transit systems. The surpluses of government enterpris-
es represent the proﬁts of government-run enterprises such as the Tennessee Valley
Authority (an electricity producer). This category of outlays is relatively small, so for
simplicity we will ignore it.
In the United States, total government outlays (Federal, state, and local) are about
a third of GDP . Figure 15.1 shows the trends since 1940 in the three main categories of
government outlays, as well as total government outlays, expressed as a percentage of
GDP. The most obvious feature of Fig. 15.1 is the enormous increase in government
purchases during World War II: In 1943 and 1944, when the war effort was at its
peak, government purchases exceeded 45% of GDP. The impact of the Korean War
(1951–1953) also is evident, though less dramatic: Government purchases of goods
1
Although government outlays for Medicare and Medicaid are used to pay for current medical
services, they are treated as transfer payments to individuals who then purchase these services.

and services increased from 15.9% of GDP in 1950 to 23.9% of GDP in 1953. Since the
late 1960s, the share of GDP devoted to government purchases has drifted gradually
downward from about 23% of GDP to around 19% of GDP .
Figure 15.1 also shows that transfer payments rose steadily as a share of GDP
from the early 1950s until the early 1980s, doubling their share of GDP during that
thirty-year period. Transfers averaged about 12% of GDP in the 2000s. The long-
term increase in transfer payments is the result of the creation of new social pro-
grams (such as Medicare and Medicaid in 1965), the expansion of beneﬁts under
existing programs (such as Social Security, which is discussed later in the chapter
in the Application “Social Security: How Can It Be Fixed?”, pp. 588–590), and the
increased number of people covered by the various programs.
Finally, Fig. 15.1 shows how net interest payments—interest payments, for
short—have evolved. Because interest payments are much smaller than the other
two categories of government outlays, they appear to ﬂuctuate less. However, inter-
est payments rose sharply as a percentage of GDP in two periods. First, interest pay-
ments nearly doubled from 1.03% of GDP in 1941 to 1.93% of GDP in 1946, reﬂecting
the large amount of government borrowing done to ﬁnance the war effort during
World War II. Second, interest payments as a share of GDP doubled during the
1980s, rising from 1.6% in 1979 to 3.3% in 1989. This increase reﬂected both increased
borrowing by the government and the generally high level of interest rates during
the 1980s. Net interest payments as a share of GDP declined in the 1990s, as interest
rates fell and the government budget moved into surplus and fell further in the
2000s as interest rates declined even more.
How does the rate of government expenditure in the United States compare with
rates in other countries with similar living standards? Because ofﬁcial accounting rules
for measuring the government budget vary widely among countries, the answer isn’t
as straightforward as you might think. Nevertheless, Table 15.1 compares the ratios of

government spending to GDP for eighteen countries in the Organization for Econom-
ic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The United States has the third lowest rate
of total government spending, as a percentage of GDP; the lowest is Australia at just
34.0%. The low rate of government spending in the United States relative to most of the
other countries largely reﬂects the more extensive government-ﬁnanced social welfare
programs (such as national health insurance) in those countries.
Taxes
On the revenue side of the government’s budget are tax receipts. There are four prin-
cipal categories of tax receipts: personal taxes, contributions for social insurance, taxes
on production and imports, and corporate taxes. Figure 15.2 shows the history of
revenues from these four major categories of taxes in the United States, all expressed
as a percentage of GDP . The share of taxes in GDP nearly doubled from 16.0% of GDP
in 1940 to 29.2% of GDP in 2000, and declined since then, standing at 25.9% in 2008.
The largest category of tax receipts is personal taxes, which are primarily person-
al income taxes and property taxes. Income taxes were ﬁrst introduced at the Feder-
al level in the United States (at very low rates and for only the richest people) during
the Civil War. However, this tax faced a series of legal challenges, and eventually the
Supreme Court declared the income tax unconstitutional. In 1913, the Sixteenth
Amendment to the Constitution gave Congress the right to impose an income tax.
Used lightly at ﬁrst, this tax is now a major source of revenue for government.
Personal taxes took their biggest jump during World War II, rising from 1.7% of
GDP in 1940 to 8.7% of GDP in 1945. The general upward drift in personal tax
receipts since 1945 has been interrupted by several tax cut bills, notably the
Kennedy–Johnson tax cut of 1964 and the Reagan tax cut of 1981. Personal taxes
rose as a result of the deﬁcit-reduction efforts of President Clinton, then declined
with President Bush’s tax cuts in the 2000s.

Figure 15.2 shows that a large share of the increase in tax receipts since
World War II reflects the increase in the second category of taxes, contributions for
social insurance (primarily Social Security taxes). Social insurance contributions
usually are levied as a fixed percentage of a worker’s salary, up to a ceiling;
income above that ceiling isn’t taxed.
2
In most cases the worker’s contributions
are matched by the employer so that the deduction appearing on the worker’s
paycheck reflects only half the total tax levied. Increases in social insurance
contributions are the result of increases both in the contribution rate and higher
ceilings on the amount of income subject to the tax.
The third category of tax receipts is taxes on production and imports, mainly sales
taxes. These taxes declined as a share of GDP during World War II and haven’t
shown any signiﬁcant long-term increase or decrease since.
The ﬁnal category of tax receipts is corporate taxes, particularly corporate proﬁt
taxes. Figure 15.2 shows that corporate taxes rose sharply during World War II and
the Korean War, then drifted gradually downward as a share of GDP from the
mid 1950s until the mid 1980s. Corporate tax receipts have accounted for 2% to 3%
of GDP in recent years.
The Composition of Outlays and Taxes: The Federal Government Versus State and Local
Governments. The components of government spending shown in Fig. 15.1 and the
components of taxes shown in Fig. 15.2 lump together Federal, state, and local
governments. For most purposes of macroeconomic analysis, combining Federal,
state, and local ﬁscal policy is the most sensible choice. The macroeconomic effect of a
new highway-building program, for example, shouldn’t depend on whether the new
highways are ﬁnanced from the Federal, state, or local budgets—or from a combi-
nation of those budgets. In this respect the tendency of many news stories about ﬁscal
policy to focus exclusively on the Federal government’s budget can be misleading.
Nevertheless, it is useful to know that in the United States, Federal government
budgets have a much different composition, on both the expenditure and the rev-
enue sides, than those of state and local governments. A summary of the major
components of both the Federal and the combined state and local government
budgets for 2008 is given in Table 15.2. Note in particular the following points:
1. Government consumption expenditures. About three-fourths of state and local
current expenditures (expenditures excluding investment) is for goods and
services. In contrast, about 30% of Federal current expenditures is for goods
and services, and about two-thirds of this amount is for national defense.
More than 80% of government consumption expenditures on nondefense goods and
services in the United States comes from state and local governments.
2. Transfer payments. The Federal budget is more heavily weighted toward trans-
fer payments (particularly, beneﬁts from Social Security and related programs)
than state and local budgets are.
3. Grants in aid. Grants in aid are payments made by the Federal government to
state and local governments to help support various education, transportation,
and welfare programs. Grants in aid appear as a current expenditure for the Fed-
eral government and as a receipt for state and local governments. In 2008, these
grants made up more than one-ﬁfth of state and local government receipts.
4. Net interest paid. Because of the large quantity of Federal government bonds
outstanding, net interest payments are an important component of Federal

spending. In contrast, net interest payments for state and local governments are
usually small and sometimes negative, which occurs when state and local gov-
ernments (which hold substantial amounts of Federal government bonds)
receive more interest than they pay out.
5. Composition of taxes. More than 80% of Federal government receipts come
from personal taxes (primarily the Federal income tax) and contributions for
social insurance. Less than 10% of Federal revenues are from corporate taxes,
and only about 4% are from taxes on production and imports such as sales
taxes. In contrast, taxes on production and imports account for about half of
state and local revenues. About one-ﬁfth of state and local revenues come
from personal taxes (both income taxes and property taxes) and contributions
for social insurance. As already mentioned, state and local governments also
count as revenue the grants in aid they receive from the Federal government.

Deficits and Surpluses
Government outlays need not equal tax revenues in each period. In Chapter 2 we
showed that, when government outlays exceed revenues, there is a government
budget deﬁcit (or simply a deﬁcit); when revenues exceed outlays, there is a gov-
ernment budget surplus. For ease of reference we write the definition of the
deﬁcit as
(15.1)
A second deficit concept, called the primary government budget deficit,
excludes net interest from government outlays:
(15.2)
The primary deﬁcit is the amount by which government purchases and transfers
exceed tax revenues; the primary deﬁcit plus net interest payments equals the
deﬁcit. Figure 15.3 illustrates the relationship between the two concepts.
Why have two deﬁcit concepts? The reason is that each answers a different
question. The standard or total budget deﬁcit answers the question: How much
does the government currently have to borrow to pay for its total outlays? When
measured in nominal terms, the deﬁcit during any year is the number of additional
dollars that the government must borrow during that year.

578 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
The primary deficit answers the question: Can the government afford its
current programs? If the primary deﬁcit is zero, the government is collecting just
enough tax revenue to pay for its current purchases of goods and services and its
current social programs (as reﬂected by transfer payments). If the primary deﬁcit is
greater than zero, current government purchases and social programs cost more
than current tax revenue can pay for. Net interest payments are ignored in the pri-
mary deﬁcit because they represent not current program costs but costs of past
expenditures ﬁnanced by government borrowing.
The separation of government purchases into government investment and
government consumption expenditures introduces another set of deﬁcit concepts:
the current deﬁcit and the primary current deﬁcit. The current deﬁcit is equivalent to
the deﬁcit in Eq. (15.1), with outlays replaced by current expenditures, which are all
government outlays except government investment. The primary current deﬁcit is
the current deﬁcit minus interest payments. Table 15.2 shows the current deﬁcit and
the primary current deﬁcit for 2008.
Figure 15.4 shows the current deﬁcit and primary current deﬁcit for all levels of
government combined as a percentage of GDP since 1940. Again, the World War II
period stands out; the government ﬁnanced only part of the war effort with taxes and
thus ran large primary and overall deﬁcits.
3
Large deﬁcits (using both concepts) also
occurred in the mid 1970s and again in the early 1980s. Although the primary deﬁcit
actually became a primary surplus for several years in the 1980s and 1990s, large

during the 1980s and early

reﬂects increasing interest
payments on the govern-
ment’s accumulated debt.

Much of the increased government spending in World War II was on government investment, which is
not counted in the current deﬁcit. As a result, the overall deﬁcit, deﬁned in Eq. (15.1), was even higher
than the current deﬁcit and exceeded 20% of GDP , as you can see by comparing Fig. 15.1 with Fig. 15.2.

interest payments kept the overall deﬁcit large until the late 1990s, when the overall
budget went into surplus. Tax cuts in the early 2000s returned the budget to deﬁcit,
and the deﬁcit is projected to soar to $1587 billion in 2009, which is 11.2% of GDP , as
a result of the stimulus package enacted in 2009 to help recover from the recession (see
“In Touch with Data and Research: The Stimulus Package of 2009,” pp. 595–596).
15.2 Government Spending, Taxes, and the Macroeconomy
How does ﬁscal policy affect the performance of the macroeconomy? Economists
emphasize three main ways by which government spending and taxing decisions
influence macroeconomic variables such as output, employment, and prices:
(1) aggregate demand, (2) government capital formation, and (3) incentives.
Fiscal Policy and Aggregate Demand
Fiscal policy can affect economic activity by inﬂuencing the total amount of spend-
ing in the economy, or aggregate demand. Recall that aggregate demand is repre-
sented by the intersection of the IS and LM curves. In either the classical or the
Keynesian IS-LM model, a temporary increase in government purchases reduces
desired national saving and shifts the IS curve up and to the right, thereby raising
aggregate demand.
Classical and Keynesian economists have different beliefs about the effect of tax
changes on aggregate demand. Classicals usually accept the Ricardian equivalence
proposition, which says that lump-sum tax changes do not affect desired national
saving and thus have no impact on the IS curve or aggregate demand.
4
Keynesians
generally disagree with this conclusion; in the Keynesian view, a cut (for example)
in taxes is likely to stimulate desired consumption and reduce desired national
saving, thereby shifting the IS curve up and to the right and raising aggregate
demand.
Classicals and Keynesians also disagree over the question of whether ﬁscal
policy should be used to fight the business cycle. Classicals generally reject
attempts to smooth business cycles, by ﬁscal policy or by other means. In contrast,
Keynesians argue that using ﬁscal policy to stabilize the economy and maintain full
employment—for example, by cutting taxes and raising spending when the econ-
omy is in a recession—is desirable.
However, even Keynesians admit that the use of ﬁscal policy as a stabilization tool
is difﬁcult. A signiﬁcant problem is lack of ﬂexibility. The government’s budget has
many purposes besides macroeconomic stabilization, such as maintaining national
security , providing income support for eligible groups, developing the nation’s infra-
structure (roads, bridges, and public buildings), and supplying government services
(education and public health). Much of government spending is committed years in
advance (as in weapons development programs) or even decades in advance (as for
Social Security beneﬁts). Expanding or contracting total government spending rapid-
ly for macroeconomic stabilization purposes thus is difﬁcult without either spending
wastefully or compromising other ﬁscal policy goals. Taxes are somewhat easier to
change than spending, but the tax laws also have many different goals and may be the
result of a fragile political compromise that isn’t easily altered.
4
We introduced Ricardian equivalence in Chapter 4. We discuss this idea further in Section 15.3.
M15_ABEL4529_07_SE_C15.QXD  12/18/09  1:03 AM  Page 579
580 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
Compounding the problem of inﬂexibility is the problem of long time lags that
result from the slow-moving political process by which ﬁscal policy is made. From
the time a spending or tax proposal is made until it goes into effect is rarely less
than eighteen months. This lag makes effective countercyclical use of ﬁscal policy
difﬁcult because (for example), by the time an antirecession ﬁscal measure actual-
ly had an impact on the economy, the recession might already be over.
Automatic Stabilizers and the Full-Employment Deficit. One way to get
around the problems of ﬁscal policy inﬂexibility and long lags that impede the
use of countercyclical ﬁscal policies is to build automatic stabilizers into the
budget. Automatic stabilizers are provisions in the budget that cause government
spending to rise or taxes to fall automatically—without legislative action—when
GDP falls. Similarly, when GDP rises, automatic stabilizers cause spending to fall
or taxes to rise without any need for direct legislative action.
A good example of an automatic stabilizer is unemployment insurance. When
the economy goes into a recession and unemployment rises, more people receive
unemployment beneﬁts, which are paid automatically without further action by
Congress. Thus the unemployment insurance component of transfers rises during
recessions, making ﬁscal policy automatically more expansionary.
5
Quantitatively, the most important automatic stabilizer is the income tax
system. When the economy goes into a recession, people’s incomes fall, and they
pay less income tax. This “automatic tax cut” helps cushion the drop in disposable
income and (according to Keynesians) prevents aggregate demand from falling as
far as it might otherwise. Likewise, when people’s incomes rise during a boom, the
government collects more income tax revenue, which helps restrain the increase in
aggregate demand. Keynesians argue that this automatic ﬁscal policy is a major
reason for the increased stability of the economy since World War II.
A side effect of automatic stabilizers is that government budget deﬁcits tend to
increase in recessions because government spending automatically rises and taxes
automatically fall when GDP declines. Similarly, the deﬁcit tends to fall in booms.
To distinguish changes in the deﬁcit caused by recessions or booms from changes
caused by other factors, some economists advocate the use of a deﬁcit measure
called the full-employment deﬁcit. The full-employment deﬁcit indicates what
the government budget deﬁcit would be—given the tax and spending policies cur-
rently in force—if the economy were operating at its full-employment level.
6
Because it eliminates the effects of automatic stabilizers, the full-employment
deﬁcit measure is affected primarily by changes in ﬁscal policy reﬂected in new leg-
islation. In particular, expansionary ﬁscal changes—such as increases in govern-
ment spending programs or (in the Keynesian model) reduced tax rates—raise the
full-employment budget deﬁcit, whereas contractionary ﬁscal changes reduce the
full-employment deﬁcit.
Figure 15.5 shows the actual and full-employment budget deﬁcits (as percentages
of full-employment output) of the Federal government since 1960. Note that the actual
budget deﬁcit substantially exceeded the full-employment budget deﬁcit during or
5
This statement is based on the Keynesian view that an increase in transfers—which is equivalent to a
reduction in taxes—raises aggregate demand.
6
In practice, the calculation of full-employment deﬁcits is based on the Keynesian assumption that
recessions reﬂect deviations from full employment rather than the classical assumption that (in the
absence of misperceptions) recessions reﬂect changes in full-employment output.
M15_ABEL4529_07_SE_C15.QXD  12/18/09  1:03 AM  Page 580
Chapter 15 Government Spending and its Financing 581
slightly after the recessions of 1973–1975, 1981–1982, 1990–1991, and 2001 when output
was below its full-employment level. The difference between the two deﬁcit measures
reﬂects the importance of automatic stabilizers in the budget.
Government Capital Formation
The health of the economy depends not only on how much the government spends but
also on how it spends its resources. For example, as discussed in Chapter 6, the quan-
tity and quality of public infrastructure—roads, schools, public hospitals, and the
like—are potentially important for the rate of economic growth. Thus the formation of
government capital—long-lived physical assets owned by the government—is one
way that ﬁscal policy affects the macroeconomy. The government budget affects not
only physical capital formation but also human capital formation. At least part of gov-
ernment expenditures on health, nutrition, and education are an investment, in the
sense that they will lead to a more productive work force in the future.
The ofﬁcial ﬁgures for government capital investment focus on physical capital
formation and exclude human capital formation. In 2008 Federal government invest-
ment expenditures were $148.2 billion (about one-seventh of Federal purchases of
goods and services), with 70% of investment spending for national defense and 30%
for nondefense government capital. State and local government investment was
$348.2 billion (about one-ﬁfth of state and local government purchases of goods and
services). The composition of government investment by state and local governments
differs from that by the Federal government. Most Federal government investment is
in the form of equipment (such as military hardware and software) rather than struc-
tures, but about four-ﬁfths of state and local government investment is for structures.

582 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
Incentive Effects of Fiscal Policy
The third way in which ﬁscal policy affects the macroeconomy is by its effects on
incentives. Tax policies in particular can affect economic behavior by changing the
ﬁnancial rewards to various activities. For example, in Chapter 4 we showed how
tax rates inﬂuence the incentives of households to save and of ﬁrms to make capi-
tal investments.
Average Versus Marginal Tax Rates. To analyze the effects of taxes on economic
incentives, we need to distinguish between average and marginal tax rates. The
average tax rate is the total amount of taxes paid by a person (or a ﬁrm), divided by
the person’s before-tax income. The marginal tax rate is the fraction of an additional
dollar of income that must be paid in taxes. For example, suppose that in a particular
country no taxes are levied on the ﬁrst $10,000 of income and that a 25% tax is levied
on all income above $10,000 (see Table 15.3). Under this income tax system a person
with an income of $18,000 pays a tax of $2000. Thus her average tax rate is 11.1%
($2000 in taxes divided by $18,000 in before-tax income). However, this taxpayer’s
marginal tax rate is 25%, because a $1.00 increase in her income will increase her taxes
by $0.25. Table 15.3 shows that everyone with an income higher than $10,000 faces the
same marginal tax rate of 25% but that the average tax rate increases with income.
We can show why the distinction between average and marginal tax rates is
important by considering the individual’s decision about how much labor to supply .
The effects of a tax increase on the amount of labor supplied depend strongly on
whether average or marginal taxes are being increased. Economic theory predicts
that an increase in the average tax rate, with the marginal tax rate held constant, will
increase the amount of labor supplied at any (before-tax) real wage. In contrast, the
theory predicts that an increase in the marginal tax rate, with the average tax rate
held constant, will decrease the amount of labor supplied at any real wage.
To explain these conclusions, let’s ﬁrst consider the effects of a change in the aver-
age tax rate. Returning to our example from Table 15.3, imagine that the marginal tax
rate stays at 25% but that now all income over $8000 (rather than all income over
$10,000) is subject to a 25% tax. The taxpayer with an income of $18,000 ﬁnds that her
tax bill has risen from $2000 to $2500, or 0.25($18,000 $8000), so her average tax
rate has risen from 11.1% to 13.9%, or $2500/$18,000. As a result, the taxpayer is $500
poorer. Because she is effectively less wealthy, she will increase the amount of labor
she supplies at any real wage (see Summary table 4, p. 80). Hence an increase in the
average tax rate, holding the marginal tax rate ﬁxed, shifts the labor supply curve
(in a diagram with the before-tax real wage on the vertical axis) to the right.

7
In terms of the analysis of Chapter 3, the increase in the average tax rate has a pure income effect on
labor supply.
M15_ABEL4529_07_SE_C15.QXD  12/18/09  1:03 AM  Page 582
Chapter 15 Government Spending and its Financing 583
Now consider the effects of an increase in the marginal tax rate, with the aver-
age tax rate constant. Suppose that the marginal tax rate on income increases from
25% to 40% and the rise is accompanied by other changes in the tax law that keep
the average tax rate—and thus the total amount of taxes paid by the typical
taxpayer— the same. To be speciﬁc, suppose that the portion of income not subject
to tax is increased from $10,000 to $13,000. Then for the taxpayer earning $18,000,
total taxes are $2000, or , and the average tax rate of 11.1%,
or $2000/$18,000, is the same as it was under the original tax law.
8
With the average tax rate unchanged, the taxpayer’s wealth is unaffected, and so
there is no change in labor supply stemming from a change in wealth. However, the
increase in the marginal tax rate implies that the taxpayer’s after-tax reward for each
extra hour worked declines. For example, if her wage is $20 per hour before taxes, at
the original marginal tax rate of 25%, her actual take-home pay for each extra hour of
work is $15 ($20 minus 25% of $20, or $5, in taxes). At the new marginal tax rate of
40%, the taxpayer’s take-home pay for each extra hour of work is only $12 ($20 in
before-tax wages minus $8 in taxes). Because extra hours of work no longer carry as
much reward in terms of real income earned, at any speciﬁc before-tax real wage the
taxpayer is likely to work fewer hours and enjoy more leisure instead. Thus, if the
average tax rate is held ﬁxed, an increase in the marginal tax rate causes the labor
supply curve to shift to the left.

APPLICATION
Labor Supply and Tax Reform in the 1980s
Twice during the 1980s Congress passed tax reform legislation that dramatically
reduced marginal tax rates. At the beginning of the decade the highest marginal tax rate
on labor income was 50%. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (known as ERTA)
reduced personal income tax rates in three stages, with a complete phase-in by 1984.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 further reduced personal tax rates. By the end of the 1980s
the marginal tax rate on the highest levels of personal income had fallen to 28%.
10
The 1981 tax act was championed by a group of economists, politicians, and jour-
nalists who favored an approach to economic policy called supply-side economics.
The basic belief of supply-side economics is that all aspects of economic behavior—
such as labor supply, saving, and investment—respond to economic incentives and,
in particular, to incentives provided by the tax code. Although most economists
agree with this idea in general, “supply-siders” went further, claiming that the incen-
tive effects of tax policy are much larger than most economists have traditionally
believed. In particular, supply-siders argued that the amount of labor supplied
would increase substantially as a result of the tax reductions in ERTA.
10
However, because of a quirk in the tax law, some people with relatively high income, but not those
with the highest incomes, faced a 33% marginal tax rate.
8
Although the average tax rate is unchanged for the taxpayer earning $18,000, the average tax rate
increases for taxpayers earning more than $18,000 and decreases for taxpayers earning less than $18,000.
9
In terms of the discussion in Chapter 3, a change in the marginal tax rate with no change in the average

What does the theory discussed in this section predict about the likely response
of labor supply to ERTA? Along with the sharp reduction in marginal tax rates, the
average tax rate also fell after 1981 (see the accompanying table). Between 1981 and
1984 Federal taxes fell from 21.1% of GDP to 19.2% of GDP , and the combined taxes
collected by Federal, state, and local governments fell from 31.1% of GDP to 29.7%
of GDP. The theory suggests that the reduction in marginal tax rates should have
increased labor supply and that the decline in average tax rates should have reduced
labor supply, leading to an ambiguous and probably small effect overall. Actually,
the labor force participation rate (the proportion of adults who are working or
actively searching for jobs) didn’t change noticeably after 1981, so apparently any
effect that ERTA had on labor supply was indeed small.
The 1986 Tax Reform Act also reduced the marginal tax rate on labor income but,
unlike ERTA, it caused a small increase in the average tax rate. Between the passage of
tax reform in 1986 and its full phase-in in 1988, the average Federal tax rate rose from
19.4% of GDP to 19.8% of GDP . The average combined tax rate of Federal, state, and
local governments also rose, increasing from 30.2% to 30.5% of GDP . Because the 1986
Tax Reform Act reduced the marginal tax rate and raised the average tax rate slightly ,
the overall result should have been an increase in labor supply . There is some evidence
that this increase in labor supply occurred. For example, after gradually declining
since at least 1950, the labor force participation rate for men leveled off in 1988 and
actually increased in 1989 for the ﬁrst time in more than a decade.
Overall, the responses of labor supply to the revisions to the tax law in the
1980s are consistent with our analysis of the effects of average and marginal tax rate
changes. However, contrary to the predictions of the supply-siders, the actual
changes in labor supply were quite small. One study estimated that the Tax Reform
Act of 1986 increased the labor supply of men by 0.9%, and the 1981 ERTA
increased the labor supply of men by only 0.4%.

Tax-Induced Distortions and Tax Rate Smoothing. Because taxes affect economic
incentives, they change the pattern of economic behavior. If the invisible hand of
free markets is working properly, the pattern of economic activity in the absence of
taxes is the most efﬁcient, so changes in behavior caused by taxes reduce economic
welfare. Tax-induced deviations from efﬁcient, free-market outcomes are called
distortions.
To illustrate the idea of a distortion, let’s go back to the example of the worker
whose before-tax real wage is $20. Because proﬁt-maximizing employers demand
labor up to the point that the marginal product of labor equals the real wage, the
real output produced by an extra hour of the worker’s labor (her marginal prod-
uct) also is $20. Now suppose that the worker is willing to sacriﬁce leisure to
work an extra hour if she receives at least $14 in additional real earnings. Because
the value of what the worker can produce in an extra hour of labor exceeds the
value that she places on an extra hour of leisure, her working the extra hour is
economically efﬁcient.
In an economy without taxes, this efﬁcient outcome occurs because the worker
is willing to work the extra hour for the extra $20 in real wages. She would also be
willing to work the extra hour if the marginal tax rate on earnings was 25%, because
at a marginal tax rate of 25% her after-tax real wage is $15, which exceeds the $14 real
wage minimum that she is willing to accept. However, if the marginal tax rate rises
to 40%, so that the worker’s after-tax wage falls to only $12, she would decide that it
isn’t worth her while to work the extra hour, even though for her to do so would have
been economically efﬁcient. The difference between the number of hours the worker
would have worked had there been no tax on wages and the number of hours she
actually works when there is a tax reﬂects the distorting effect of the tax. The higher
the tax rate is, the greater the distortion is likely to be.
Because doing without taxes entirely isn’t possible, the problem for ﬁscal pol-
icymakers is how to raise needed government revenues while keeping distortions
relatively small. Because high tax rates are particularly costly in terms of econom-
ic efﬁciency, economists argue that keeping tax rates roughly constant at a moder-
ate level is preferable to alternate periods of very low and very high tax rates. For
example, if the government’s spending plans require it to levy a tax rate that over
a number of years averages 20%, most economists would advise the government
not to set the tax rate at 30% half the time and 10% the other half. The reason is the
large distortions that the 30% tax rate would cause in the years that it was effective.
A better strategy is to hold the tax rate constant at 20%. A policy of maintaining
stable tax rates so as to minimize distortions is called tax rate smoothing.
Has the Federal government had a policy of tax rate smoothing? Statistical
studies typically have found that Federal tax rates are affected by political and
other factors and hence aren’t as smooth as is necessary to minimize distor-
tions.
12
Nevertheless, the idea of tax smoothing is still useful. For example, what
explains the U.S. government’s huge deﬁcit during World War II (Fig. 15.4)? The
alternative to deficit financing of the war would have been a large wartime
increase in tax rates, coupled with a drop in tax rates when the war was over. But
high tax rates during the war would have distorted the economy when produc-
tive efﬁciency was especially important. By ﬁnancing the war through borrowing,

the government effectively spread the needed tax increase over a long period of
time (as the debt was repaid) rather than raising current taxes by a large amount.
This action is consistent with the idea of tax smoothing.
15.3 Government Deficits and Debt
The single number in the Federal government’s budget that is the focus of most
public attention is the size of the budget deﬁcit or surplus. During the 1980s and
early 1990s, large deﬁcits led to vigorous public debate about the potential impact of
big deﬁcits on the economy, and this debate was reignited as the budget deﬁcit in
2009 was projected to exceed 11% of GDP . In the rest of this chapter we discuss the
government budget deﬁcit, the government debt, and their effects on the economy.
The Growth of the Government Debt
There is an important distinction between the government budget deﬁcit and the
government debt (also called the national debt). The government budget deﬁcit
(a ﬂow variable) is the difference between expenditures and tax revenues in any
ﬁscal year. The government debt (a stock variable) is the total value of government
bonds outstanding at any particular time. Because the excess of government expen-
ditures over revenues equals the amount of new borrowing that the government
must do—that is, the amount of new government debt that it must issue—any
year’s deﬁcit (measured in dollar, or nominal, terms) equals the change in the debt
in that year. We can express the relationship between government debt and the
budget deﬁcit by
(15.3)
where B is the change in the nominal value of government bonds outstanding.
In a period of persistently large budget deﬁcits, such as that experienced by
the United States in the 1980s and early and mid-1990s, the nominal value of the
government’s debt will grow quickly. For example, between 1980 and 2008,
Federal government debt outstanding grew by almost eleven times in nominal
terms, from $909 billion in 1980 to $9986 billion in 2008.
13
Taking inﬂation into
account, the real value of government debt outstanding increased nearly ﬁve-fold
during this period.
Because countries with a high GDP have relatively more resources available to
pay the principal and interest on the government’s bonds, a useful measure of
government indebtedness is the quantity of government debt outstanding divided
by the GDP, or the debt–GDP ratio. Figure 15.6 shows the history of the debt–GDP
ratio in the United States since 1939. The upper curve shows the debt–GDP ratio
when the measure of total government debt outstanding includes both government
bonds held by the public and government bonds held by government agencies and
the Federal Reserve. The lower curve includes in the measure of debt outstanding
only the government debt held by the public.
The most striking feature of Fig. 15.6 is the large increase in the debt–GDP ratio
that occurred during World War II when the government sold bonds to ﬁnance the

war effort. By the end of the war, the debt–GDP ratio exceeded 100%, implying that
the value of government debt outstanding was greater than a year’s GDP . Over the
following thirty-ﬁve years the government steadily reduced its indebtedness relative
to GDP. Beginning in about 1980, though, greater budget deficits caused the
debt–GDP ratio to rise, which it did throughout the decade. Despite this increase, by
1995 the ratio of Federal debt to GDP was still only about half its size at the end of
World War II. In the late 1990s, rapid economic growth caused tax revenues to
increase substantially, leading to government budget surpluses that reduced the
debt–GDP ratio considerably . The debt–GDP ratio began to increase in 2002 as large
Federal budget deﬁcits emerged and it is projected to increase dramatically as a
result of the stimulus package implemented in 2009 (see “In Touch with Data and
Research: The Stimulus Package of 2009,” pp. 595–596).
We can describe changes in the debt–GDP ratio over time by the following formula
(derived in Appendix 15.A at the end of the chapter):
(15.4)
Equation (15.4) emphasizes two factors that cause the debt–GDP ratio to rise
quickly:
■ a high deﬁcit relative to GDP and
■ a slow rate of GDP growth.
Equation (15.4) helps account for the pattern of the debt–GDP ratio shown in
Fig. 15.6. The sharp increase during World War II was the result of large deﬁcits. In

contrast, for the three and a half decades after World War II, the Federal
government’s deﬁcit was small and GDP growth was rapid, so the debt–GDP ratio
declined. The debt–GDP ratio increased during the 1980s and early 1990s because
the Federal deﬁcit was high. Large surpluses helped reduce the debt–GDP ratio in
the late 1990s, but large deﬁcits beginning in 2002 have reversed the decline in the
debt–GDP ratio. One factor affecting the debt–GDP ratio is the Social Security
system, discussed in the Application “Social Security: How Can It Be Fixed?”
APPLICATION
Social Security: How Can It Be Fixed?
The Social Security system was created in 1937, during the administration of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to provide income to retired workers. Since then,
the program has been expanded to include payments to survivors of deceased
workers (in 1939) and to people unable to work because of a disability (in 1954).
14
Recently, Social Security has been the focus of much attention because projections
suggest that, unless the program is reformed, it will be unable to pay promised ben-
eﬁts to future retirees.
Social Security today is largely a pay-as-you-go system, which means that most of
the payroll taxes that workers and their employers pay in go directly to retirees and
other beneﬁciaries. The portion of payroll tax revenue not used to fund the beneﬁts of
current beneﬁciaries is spent by the Federal government on other programs. To keep
track of its obligations to the Social Security system, the government credits the system
account, known as the Social Security trust fund, with special government bonds
(IOUs) equal to the amount of payroll taxes spent on other programs. In the future,
when Social Security payroll taxes are no longer sufﬁcient to fund contemporaneous
Social Security beneﬁts, much of the difference will be made up by redeeming bonds
from the trust fund. In practice, the government will be able to pay off these bonds
only by raising taxes or cutting spending on other programs.
As long as the number of workers paying into Social Security greatly exceeded
the number of retirees and other beneﬁciaries, the system could ﬁnance itself on a
pay-as-you-go basis, with any excess Social Security tax revenue added to the Social
Security trust fund. However, the ratio of workers to retirees is expected to decrease
signiﬁcantly in the coming decades, reﬂecting the impending retirement of the baby
boomers (the large cohort of people born in the years immediately after World War II),
declining U.S. birth rates, and longer life expectancies (which mean that people
spend many more years in retirement than they used to). Figure 15.7 shows that the
Social Security system will take in more in tax revenue than it spends until 2016.
The projections show that tax revenue will fall slightly as a percent of GDP , but that
payouts as a percent of GDP rise sharply in 2009 and rise over the subsequent 25
years, as the baby boomers retire and collect beneﬁts. By 2016, payouts exceed tax
revenue each year. By 2030, payouts exceed tax revenue by an amount equal to 1.3%
of GDP. For a while, the Social Security system can use its interest earnings and

redeem bonds in the Social Security trust fund to be able to pay beneﬁts that exceed
tax revenue each year. But if the system is not modiﬁed, the trustees estimate that the
trust fund will be exhausted in 2037 and the system will no longer be able to pay cur-
rently promised beneﬁts.
Fixing the Social Security System
Several proposals to fix the Social Security system have been suggested. The
proposals include increasing tax revenue coming into the system, earning a higher
rate of return on the Social Security trust fund, and reducing beneﬁt payments
made by Social Security. Tax revenue could be increased by raising Social Security
payroll taxes or by subjecting more income to the tax, but both would distort workers’
labor supply decisions. The rate of return on the Social Security trust fund could be
increased by allowing the government to invest the trust fund in the stock market,
but this would clearly increase the risk to the trust fund’s return, and could lead to
government interference in the stock market. Beneﬁt payments could be reduced
by raising the age at which beneﬁts could be collected (to match the increase in life
expectancy), or by changing the formula relating beneﬁts to the average increase in
wages and prices.
Another controversial proposal would allow people (on a voluntary basis) to
invest some portion of their Social Security taxes in individual accounts that could
include well-diversiﬁed mutual funds that hold stocks. Such individual accounts
would allow workers some control over their retirement funds and how they are
invested.

The Burden of the Government Debt on Future Generations
People often express concern that the trillions of dollars of Federal government debt
will impose a crushing ﬁnancial burden on their children and grandchildren, who
will someday be taxed to pay off these debts. In this view, high rates of government
borrowing amount to “robbing the future” to pay for government spending that is
too high or taxes that are too low in the present.
This conventional argument ignores the fact that most U.S. government bonds are
owned by U.S. citizens (though, recently, some countries—notably China—have
bought large amounts of U.S. government bonds). Therefore, although our descendants
someday may face heavy taxes to pay the interest and principal of the government
debt, these future taxpayers also will inherit outstanding government bonds and thus
will be the recipients of most of those interest and principal payments. To a substantial
degree, we owe the government debt to ourselves, so the debt isn’t a burden in the
same sense that it would be if it were owed entirely to outsiders.
Although the popular view of the burden of the government debt is faulty,
economists have pointed out several ways in which the government debt can
become a burden on future generations. First, if tax rates have to be raised sub-
stantially in the future to pay off the debt, the resulting distortions could cause the
economy to function less efﬁciently and impose costs on future generations.
Second, most people hold small amounts of government bonds or no govern-
ment bonds at all (except perhaps indirectly , as through pension funds). In the future,
people who hold few or no bonds may have to pay more in taxes to pay off the gov-
ernment debt than they receive in interest and principal payments; people holding
large quantities of bonds may receive more in interest and principal than they pay in
increased taxes. Bondholders are richer on average than nonbondholders, so the
need to service the government debt might lead to a transfer of resources from the
relatively poor to the relatively rich. However, this transfer could be offset by other
tax and transfer policies—for example, by raising taxes on high-income people.
The third argument is probably the most signiﬁcant: Many economists claim
that government deﬁcits reduce national saving; that is, when the government
runs a deﬁcit, the economy accumulates less domestic capital and fewer foreign
An objection to individual accounts arises from the fact that, under a pay-as-you-
go system, Social Security payroll taxes are used to fund beneﬁts to current retirees.
Thus if payroll taxes are directed toward individual accounts, the government will
not receive sufﬁcient revenue to pay current beneﬁts and would have to increase tax
rates or borrow the difference, increasing the amount of government debt that is
issued. So individual accounts could be a useful component of a comprehensive
overhaul of the Social Security system, but by themselves they are unlikely to eradi-
cate the projected shortfall facing the current system.
Do we really need to worry about Social Security now? Or can we just wait
until 2037 and see if the Social Security system runs out of funds? Most experts
seem to think that the demographic trends are very clear and that the system is in
trouble. If, indeed, the Social Security system needs to be ﬁxed, then the longer we
wait to reform it, the more drastic will be the changes that are ultimately required
to restore solvency to the system.
M15_ABEL4529_07_SE_C15.QXD  12/18/09  1:04 AM  Page 590
assets than it would have if the deﬁcit had been lower. If this argument is correct,
deﬁcits will lower the standard of living for our children and grandchildren, both
because they will inherit a smaller capital stock and because they will have to pay
more interest to (or receive less interest from) foreigners than they otherwise would
have. This reduction in the future standard of living would constitute a true burden
of the government debt.
Crucial to this argument, however, is the idea that government budget deﬁcits
reduce national saving. As we have mentioned at several points in this book
(notably in Chapter 4), the question of whether budget deﬁcits affect national
saving is highly controversial. We devote most of the rest of this section to further
discussion of this issue.
Budget Deficits and National Saving: Ricardian Equivalence Revisited
Under what circumstances will an increased government budget deﬁcit cause
national saving to fall? Virtually all economists agree that an increase in the deﬁcit
caused by a rise in government purchases—say, to ﬁght a war—reduces national
saving and imposes a real burden on the economy. However, whether a deﬁcit
caused by a cut in current taxes or an increase in current transfers reduces nation-
al saving is much less clear. Recall that advocates of Ricardian equivalence argue
that tax cuts or increases in transfers will not affect national saving, whereas its
opponents disagree.
Ricardian Equivalence: An Example. To illustrate Ricardian equivalence let’s
suppose that, holding its current and planned future purchases constant, the
government cuts this year’s taxes by $100 per person. (Assuming that the tax cut
is a lump sum allows us to ignore incentive effects.) What impact will this
reduction in taxes have on national saving? In answering this question, we ﬁrst
recall the deﬁnition of national saving (Eq. 2.8):
(15.5)
Equation (15.5) states that national saving, S, equals output, Y, less consumption, C,
and government purchases, G.
15
If we assume that government purchases, G, are
constant and that output, Y, is ﬁxed at its full-employment level, we know from
Eq. (15.5) that the tax cut will reduce national saving, S, only if it causes consump-
tion, C, to rise. Advocates of Ricardian equivalence assert that, if current and
planned future government purchases are unchanged, a tax cut will not affect con-
sumption and thus won’t affect national saving.
Why wouldn’t a tax cut that raises after-tax incomes cause people to consume
more? The answer is that—if current and planned future government purchases
don’t change—a tax cut today must be accompanied by an offsetting increase in
expected future taxes. To see why, note that if current taxes are reduced by $100 per
person without any change in government purchases, the government must
borrow an additional $100 per person by selling bonds. Suppose that the bonds are
one-year bonds that pay a real interest rate, r. In the following year, when the gov-
ernment repays the principal ($100 per person) and interest ($100 r per person)
on the bonds, it will have to collect an additional $100(1 r) per person in taxes. +

We assume that net factor payments from abroad, NFP, are zero.
M15_ABEL4529_07_SE_C15.QXD  12/18/09  1:04 AM  Page 591
592 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
Thus, when the public learns of the current tax cut of $100 per person, they should
also expect their taxes to increase by $100(1 r) per person next year.
16
Because the current tax cut is balanced by an increase in expected future taxes, it
doesn’t make taxpayers any better off in the long run despite raising their current
after-tax incomes. Indeed, after the tax cut, taxpayers’ abilities to consume today and in
the future are the same as they were originally. That is, if no one consumes more in
response to the tax cut—so that each person saves the entire $100 increase in after-tax
income—in the following year the $100 per person of additional saving will grow to
$100(1 r) per person. This additional $100(1 r) per person is precisely the
amount needed to pay the extra taxes that will be levied in the future, leaving people
able to consume as much in the future as they had originally planned. Because
people aren’t made better off by the tax cut (which must be coupled with a future tax
increase), they have no reason to consume more today. Thus national saving should
be unaffected by the tax cut, as supporters of Ricardian equivalence claim.
Ricardian Equivalence Across Generations. The argument for Ricardian
equivalence rests on the assumption that current government borrowing will be
repaid within the lifetimes of people who are alive today. In other words, any tax
cuts received today are offset by the higher taxes that people must pay later. But
what if some of the debt the government is accumulating will be repaid not by the
people who receive the tax cut but by their children or grandchildren? In that
case, wouldn’t people react to a tax cut by consuming more?
Harvard economist Robert Barro
17
has shown that, in theory, Ricardian equiva-
lence may still apply even if the current generation receives the tax cut and future gen-
erations bear the burden of repaying the government’s debt. To state Barro’s argument
in its simplest form, let’s imagine an economy in which every generation has the
same number of people and suppose that the current generation receives a tax cut of
$100 per person. With government purchases held constant, this tax cut increases the
government’s borrowing and outstanding debt by $100 per person. However, people
currently alive are not taxed to repay this debt; instead, this obligation is deferred until
the next generation. To repay the government’s increased debt, the next generation’s
taxes (in real terms) will be raised by $100(1 +r) per person, where 1 +r is the real
value of a dollar borrowed today at the time the debt is repaid.
18
Seemingly, the current generation of people, who receive the tax cut, should
increase their consumption because the reduction in their taxes isn’t expected to be
balanced by an increase in taxes during their lifetimes. However, Barro argued
that people in the current generation shouldn’t increase their consumption in
response to a tax cut if they care about the well-being of the next generation. Of
course, people do care about the well-being of their children, as is reﬂected in part
in the economic resources devoted to children, including funds spent on children’s
health and education, gifts, and inheritances.

him Joe—might be inclined to increase his own consumption, all else being equal.
But, Barro argues, Joe should realize that, for each dollar of tax cut he receives
today, his son Joe Junior will have to pay 1 r dollars of extra taxes in the future.
Can Joe do anything on his own to help out Joe Junior? The answer is yes. Suppose
that, instead of consuming his $100 tax cut, Joe saves the $100 and uses the extra sav-
ings to increase Joe Junior’s inheritance. By the time the next generation is required
to pay the government debt, Joe Junior’s extra inheritance plus accumulated inter-
est will be $100(1 r), or just enough to cover the increase in Joe Junior’s taxes.
Thus, by saving his tax cut and adding these savings to his planned bequest, Joe can
keep both his own consumption and Joe Junior’s consumption the same as they
would have been if the tax cut had never occurred.
Furthermore, Barro points out, Joe should save all his tax cut for Joe Junior’s
benefit. Why? If Joe consumes even part of his tax cut, he won’t leave enough
extra inheritance to allow Joe Junior to pay the expected increase in his taxes,
and so Joe Junior will have to consume less than he could have if there had been
no tax cut for Joe. But if Joe wanted to increase his own consumption at Joe
Junior’s expense, he could have done so without changes in the tax laws—for
example, by contributing less to Joe Junior’s college tuition payments or by
planning to leave a smaller inheritance. That Joe didn’t take these actions shows
that he was satisfied with the division of consumption between himself and Joe
Junior that he had planned before the tax cut was enacted; there is no reason that
the tax cut should cause this original consumption plan to change. Therefore if
Joe and other members of the current generation don’t consume more in
response to a tax cut, Ricardian equivalence should hold even when debt repay-
ment is deferred to the next generation.
This analysis can be extended to allow for multiple generations and in other
ways. These extensions don’t change the main point, which is that, if taxpayers
understand that they are ultimately responsible for the government’s debt, they
shouldn’t change their consumption in response to changes in taxes or transfers that
are unaccompanied by changes in planned government purchases. As a result,
deﬁcits created by tax cuts shouldn’t reduce national saving and therefore shouldn’t
burden future generations.
Departures from Ricardian Equivalence
The arguments for Ricardian equivalence are logically sound, and this idea has
greatly inﬂuenced economists’ thinking about deﬁcits. Although thirty years ago
most economists would have taken for granted that a tax cut would substantially
increase consumption, today there is much less agreement about this claim.
Although Ricardian equivalence seemed to fail spectacularly in the 1980s in the
United States—when high government budget deficits were accompanied by
extremely low rates of national saving—data covering longer periods of time
suggest little relationship between budget deﬁcits and national saving rates in the
United States. In some other countries, such as Canada and Israel, Ricardian equiv-
alence seems to have worked quite well at times.

594 Part 4 Macroeconomic Policy: Its Environment and Institutions
Our judgment is that tax cuts that lead to increased government borrowing prob-
ably affect consumption and national saving, although the effect may be small. We
base this conclusion both on the experience of the United States during the 1980s and
on the fact that there are some theoretical reasons to expect Ricardian equivalence not
to hold exactly. The main arguments against Ricardian equivalence are the possible
existence of borrowing constraints, consumers’ shortsightedness, the failure of some
people to leave bequests, and the non-lump-sum nature of most tax changes.
1. Borrowing constraints. Many people would be willing to consume more if they
could ﬁnd lenders who would extend them credit. However, consumers often
face limits, known as borrowing constraints, on the amounts that they can bor-
row. A person who wants to consume more, but who is unable to borrow to do
so, will be eager to take advantage of a tax cut to increase consumption. Thus
the existence of borrowing constraints may cause Ricardian equivalence to fail.
2. Shortsightedness. In the view of some economists, many people are shortsighted
and don’t understand that as taxpayers they are ultimately responsible for the
government’s debt. For example, some people may determine their consumption
by simple “rules of thumb,” such as the rule that a family should spend ﬁxed per-
centages of its current after-tax income on food, clothing, housing, and so on,
without regard for how its income is likely to change in the future. If people are
shortsighted, they may respond to a tax cut by consuming more, contrary to the
prediction of Ricardian equivalence. However, Ricardians could reply that ultra-
sophisticated analyses of ﬁscal policy by consumers aren’t necessary for Ricardian
equivalence to be approximately correct. For example, if people know generally
that big government deﬁcits mean future problems for the economy (without
knowing exactly why), they may be reluctant to spend from a tax cut that causes
the deﬁcit to balloon, consistent with the Ricardian prediction.
3. Failure to leave bequests. If people don’t leave bequests, perhaps because they
don’t care or think about the long-run economic welfare of their children, they
will increase their consumption if their taxes are cut, and Ricardian equivalence
won’t hold. Some people may not leave bequests because they expect their chil-
dren to be richer than they are and thus not need any bequest. If people con-
tinue to hold this belief after they receive a tax cut, they will increase their
consumption and again Ricardian equivalence will fail.
4. Non-lump-sum taxes. In theory, Ricardian equivalence holds only for lump-sum
tax changes, with each person’s change in taxes being a ﬁxed amount that
doesn’t depend on the person’s economic decisions, such as how much to
work or save. As discussed in Section 15.2, when taxes are not lump-sum, the
level and timing of taxes will affect incentives and thus economic behavior.
Thus non-lump-sum tax cuts will have real effects on the economy, in contrast
to the simple Ricardian view.
We emphasize, though, that with non-lump-sum taxes, the incentive effects of
a tax cut on consumption and saving behavior will depend heavily on the tax
structure and on which taxes are cut. For example, a temporary cut in sales taxes
would likely stimulate consumption, but a reduction in the tax rate on interest
earned on savings accounts might increase saving. Thus we cannot always
conclude that, just because taxes aren’t lump-sum, a tax cut will increase
consumption. That conclusion has to rest primarily on the other three arguments
against Ricardian equivalence that we presented.

IN TOUCH WITH DATA AND RESEARCH
The Stimulus Package of 2009
In February 2009, the U.S. government passed a stimulus bill, The American Recov-
ery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, in the hopes of boosting the economy out of the
recession that began in December 2007. This bill, which is often called a stimulus
package, is projected to increase the Federal government’s deﬁcit by $787 billion
over the next decade, by reducing taxes by $288 billion and increasing government
expenditures by $499 billion.
Of the $499 billion in additional expenditures, the main categories are
(amounts in billions of dollars):
144 Aid to state and local governments
111 Spending on infrastructure and science
81 Social programs “protecting the vulnerable”
59 Health care
53 Education and training
43 Energy
8 Other
Speciﬁc items in the stimulus package include computerizing health records
to reduce health care costs, increasing capital spending to develop renewable
energy sources, a cash-for-clunkers program to improve the environment and
stimulate new car sales by offering $4500 for old cars that are traded in to pur-
chase more efﬁcient cars, improving insulation in Federal buildings and homes to
reduce energy use, increasing funding for college students and providing addi-
tional tax breaks to make college more affordable, increasing spending on roads,
bridges, and mass transit systems to enhance the nation’s infrastructure, giving a
tax credit to most households, and providing an additional child tax credit to
reduce taxes on families.
The Congressional Budget Ofﬁce (CBO) estimates that the stimulus package
will increase the Federal government budget deﬁcit by about $185 billion in ﬁscal
year 2009 (from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2009), $399 billion in ﬁscal year
2010, and $134 billion in ﬁscal year 2011, with increased deﬁcits also occurring
from 2012–2015. Adding the deﬁcit from the stimulus bill to the deﬁcits from other
increased spending (such as the $700 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Pro-
gram, which was used to rescue troubled ﬁnancial institutions and is discussed in
the Application “The Financial Crisis of 2008,” pp. 552–553) and lower tax collec-
tions caused by the recession that began in December 2007, the result is a sharp
increase in the debt–GDP ratio, as shown in Fig. 15.8.
The impact of the stimulus package on the future course of the debt–GDP
ratio can be seen in Fig. 15.8 by comparing CBO projections of the debt–GDP
ratio made in January 2009 (before the passage of the stimulus package) and in

March 2009 (after the passage of the stimulus package). In January 2009, the
CBO projected that although the debt–GDP ratio would rise to a peak of 54.4%
by 2011, the ratio would then decline to 41.9% by 2019. However, with the
stimulus package in place, the ratio would continue rising over time, hitting
67.8% by 2019. The CBO also projected that the package will reduce unem-
ployment substantially and increase GDP significantly, relative to what they
would have been, thus reducing the economic costs of the recession that began
in December 2007.

15.4 Deficits and Inflation
In this ﬁnal section of the chapter we discuss one more concern that has been
expressed about government budget deﬁcits: that deﬁcits are inﬂationary. We show
that the principal link between deﬁcits and inﬂation is that in some circumstances
deﬁcits lead to higher rates of growth in the money supply and that high rates of
money growth in turn cause inﬂation.
The Deficit and the Money Supply
Inﬂation—a rising price level—results when aggregate demand increases more quick-
ly than aggregate supply . In terms of the AD–AS framework, suppose that the long-run
aggregate supply curve (which reﬂects the productive capacity of the economy) is
ﬁxed. Then for the price level to rise, the aggregate demand curve must rise over time.

Chapter 15 Government Spending and its Financing 597
Both the classical and Keynesian models of the economy imply that deﬁcits can
cause aggregate demand to rise more quickly than aggregate supply, leading to an
increase in the price level. In both models a deﬁcit owing to increased government
purchases reduces desired national saving, shifting the IS curve up and to the right
and causing aggregate demand to rise. This increase in aggregate demand causes
the price level to rise.
